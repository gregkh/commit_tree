mtd: powernv_flash: Use opal_async_wait_response_interruptible()

The OPAL calls performed in this driver shouldn't be using
opal_async_wait_response() as this performs a wait_event() which, on
long running OPAL calls could result in hung task warnings. wait_event()
prevents timely signal delivery which is also undesirable.

This patch also attempts to quieten down the use of dev_err() when
errors haven't actually occurred and also to return better information up
the stack rather than always -EIO.
