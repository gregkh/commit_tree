x86/mm: Encrypt the initrd earlier for BSP microcode update

Currently the BSP microcode update code examines the initrd very early
in the boot process.  If SME is active, the initrd is treated as being
encrypted but it has not been encrypted (in place) yet.  Update the
early boot code that encrypts the kernel to also encrypt the initrd so
that early BSP microcode updates work.
