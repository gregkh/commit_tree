PM / OPP: Support updating performance state of device's power domain

The genpd framework now provides an API to request device's power
domain to update its performance state.  Use that interface from the
OPP core for devices whose power domains support performance states.

Note that this commit doesn't add any mechanism by which performance
states are made available to the OPP core. That would be done by a
later commit.

Note that the current implementation is restricted to the case where
the device doesn't have separate regulators for itself. We shouldn't
over engineer the code before we have real use case for them. We can
always come back and add more code to support such cases later on.
