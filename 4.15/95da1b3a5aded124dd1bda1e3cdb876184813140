nfsd: deal with revoked delegations appropriately

If a delegation has been revoked by the server, operations using that
delegation should error out with NFS4ERR_DELEG_REVOKED in the >4.1
case, and NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID otherwise.

The server needs NFSv4.1 clients to explicitly free revoked delegations.
If the server returns NFS4ERR_DELEG_REVOKED, the client will do that;
otherwise it may just forget about the delegation and be unable to
recover when it later sees SEQ4_STATUS_RECALLABLE_STATE_REVOKED set on a
SEQUENCE reply.  That can cause the Linux 4.1 client to loop in its
stage manager.
