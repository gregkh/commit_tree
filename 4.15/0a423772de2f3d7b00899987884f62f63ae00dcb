mfd: twl4030-audio: Fix sibling-node lookup

A helper purported to look up a child node based on its name was using
the wrong of-helper and ended up prematurely freeing the parent of-node
while leaking any matching node.

To make things worse, any matching node would not even necessarily be a
child node as the whole device tree was searched depth-first starting at
the parent.
