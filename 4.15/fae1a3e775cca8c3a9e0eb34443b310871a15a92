kvm: x86: fix RSM when PCID is non-zero

rsm_load_state_64() and rsm_enter_protected_mode() load CR3, then
CR4 & ~PCIDE, then CR0, then CR4.

However, setting CR4.PCIDE fails if CR3[11:0] != 0.  It's probably easier
in the long run to replace rsm_enter_protected_mode() with an emulator
callback that sets all the special registers (like KVM_SET_SREGS would
do).  For now, set the PCID field of CR3 only after CR4.PCIDE is 1.
