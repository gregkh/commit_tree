scsi: mpt3sas: cleanup _scsih_pcie_enumeration_event()

The indenting wasn't right, because the last two prints weren't indented
far enough.  Also it used pr_info() where it was supposed to use
pr_cont().  I reversed the if statement and pulled the code in one tab
and did a couple other minor cleanups.
