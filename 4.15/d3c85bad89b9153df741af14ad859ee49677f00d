mm, compaction: remove unneeded pageblock_skip_persistent() checks

Commit f3c931633a59 ("mm, compaction: persistently skip hugetlbfs
pageblocks") has introduced pageblock_skip_persistent() checks into
migration and free scanners, to make sure pageblocks that should be
persistently skipped are marked as such, regardless of the
ignore_skip_hint flag.

Since the previous patch introduced a new no_set_skip_hint flag, the
ignore flag no longer prevents marking pageblocks as skipped.  Therefore
we can remove the special cases.  The relevant pageblocks will be marked
as skipped by the common logic which marks each pageblock where no page
could be isolated.  This makes the code simpler.
