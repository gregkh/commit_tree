drm: gma500: fix logic error

gcc-8 points out a condition that almost certainly doesn't
do what the author had in mind:

drivers/gpu/drm/gma500/mdfld_intel_display.c: In function 'mdfldWaitForPipeEnable':
drivers/gpu/drm/gma500/mdfld_intel_display.c:102:37: error: bitwise comparison always evaluates to false [-Werror=tautological-compare]

This changes it to a simple bit mask operation to check
whether the bit is set.
