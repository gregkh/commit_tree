PM / runtime: Drop children check from __pm_runtime_set_status()

The check for "active" children in __pm_runtime_set_status(), when
trying to set the parent device status to "suspended", doesn't
really make sense, because in fact it is not invalid to set the
status of a device with runtime PM disabled to "suspended" in any
case.  It is invalid to enable runtime PM for a device with its
status set to "suspended" while its child_count reference counter
is nonzero, but the check in __pm_runtime_set_status() doesn't
really cover that situation.

For this reason, drop the children check from __pm_runtime_set_status()
and add a check against child_count reference counters of "suspended"
devices to pm_runtime_enable().
