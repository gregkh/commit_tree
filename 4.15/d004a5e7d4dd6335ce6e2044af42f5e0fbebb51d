block: remove __bio_kmap_atomic

This helper doesn't buy us much over calling kmap_atomic directly.
In fact in the only caller it does a bit of useless work as the
caller already has the bvec at hand, and said caller would even
buggy for a multi-segment bio due to the use of this helper.

So just remove it.
