iomap: Switch from blkno to disk offset

Replace iomap->blkno, the sector number, with iomap->addr, the disk
offset in bytes.  For invalid disk offsets, use the special value
IOMAP_NULL_ADDR instead of IOMAP_NULL_BLOCK.

This allows to use iomap for mappings which are not block aligned, such
as inline data on ext4.
