drm/i915/gvt: Add emulation for BAR2 (aperture) with normal file RW approach

For vfio-pci, if the region support MMAP then it should support both
mmap and normal file access. The user-space is free to choose which is
being used. For qemu, we just need add 'x-no-mmap=on' for vfio-pci
option.

Currently GVTg only support MMAP for BAR2. So GVTg will not work when
user turn on x-no-mmap option.

This patch added file style access for BAR2, aka the GPU aperture. We
map the entire aperture partition of active vGPU to kernel space when
guest driver try to enable PCI Memory Space. Then we redirect the file
RW operation from kvmgt to this mapped area.
