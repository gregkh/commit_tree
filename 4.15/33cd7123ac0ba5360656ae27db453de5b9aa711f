mailbox: reset txdone_method TXDONE_BY_POLL if client knows_txdone

Currently the mailbox framework sets txdone_method to TXDONE_BY_POLL if
the controller sets txdone_by_poll. However some clients can have a
mechanism to do TXDONE_BY_ACK which they can specify by knows_txdone.
However, we endup setting both TXDONE_BY_POLL and TXDONE_BY_ACK in that
case. In such scenario, we may end up with below warnings as the tx
ticker is run both by mailbox framework and the client.

This patch fixes the issue by resetting TXDONE_BY_POLL if client has set
knows_txdone.
