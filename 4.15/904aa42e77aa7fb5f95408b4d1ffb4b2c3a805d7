drm/amd/display: add back removed hack for mpcc add

A previous changed removed the hack to match mpcc_idd
with mi instance. This causes pstate hang on resume
from hibernate for yet unknown reason. Add the hack
back for now to work around the issue. More debugging
required in init_hw to root cause the hang.
