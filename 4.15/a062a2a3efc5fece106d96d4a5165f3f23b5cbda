xprtrdma: "Unoptimize" rpcrdma_prepare_hdr_sge()

Commit 655fec6987be ("xprtrdma: Use gathered Send for large inline
messages") assumed that, since the zeroeth element of the Send SGE
array always pointed to req->rl_rdmabuf, it needed to be initialized
just once. This was a valid assumption because the Send SGE array
and rl_rdmabuf both live in the same rpcrdma_req.

In a subsequent patch, the Send SGE array will be separated from the
rpcrdma_req, so the zeroeth element of the SGE array needs to be
initialized every time.
