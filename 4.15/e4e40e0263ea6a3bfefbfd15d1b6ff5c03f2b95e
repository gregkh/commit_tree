mm: switch to 'define pmd_write' instead of __HAVE_ARCH_PMD_WRITE

In response to compile breakage introduced by a series that added the
pud_write helper to x86, Stephen notes:

    did you consider using the other paradigm:

    In arch include files:
    #define pud_write       pud_write
    static inline int pud_write(pud_t pud)
     .....

    Then in include/asm-generic/pgtable.h:

    #ifndef pud_write
    tatic inline int pud_write(pud_t pud)
    {
            ....
    }
    #endif

    If you had, then the powerpc code would have worked ... ;-) and many
    of the other interfaces in include/asm-generic/pgtable.h are
    protected that way ...

Given that some architecture already define pmd_write() as a macro, it's
a net reduction to drop the definition of __HAVE_ARCH_PMD_WRITE.
