x86/platform/UV: Add check of TSC state set by UV BIOS

Insert a check early in UV system startup that checks whether BIOS was
able to obtain satisfactory TSC Sync stability.  If not, it usually
is caused by an error in the external TSC clock generation source.
In this case the best fallback is to use the builtin hardware RTC
as the kernel will not be able to set an accurate TSC sync either.
