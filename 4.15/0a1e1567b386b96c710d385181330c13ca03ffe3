xfs: pass inode number to xfs_scrub_ino_set_{preen,warning}

There are two ways to scrub an inode -- calling xfs_iget and checking
the raw inode core, or by loading the inode cluster buffer and checking
the on-disk contents directly.  The second method is only useful if
_iget fails the verifiers; when this is the case, sc->ip is NULL and
calling the tracepoint will cause a system crash.

Therefore, pass the raw inode number directly into the _preen and
_warning functions.
