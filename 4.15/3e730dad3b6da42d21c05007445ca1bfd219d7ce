x86/apic: Unify interrupt mode setup for SMP-capable system

On a SMP-capable system, the kernel enables and sets up the APIC interrupt
delivery mode in native_smp_prepare_cpus(). The decision how to setup the
APIC is intermingled with the decision of setting up SMP or not.

Split the initialization of the APIC interrupt mode independent from other
decisions and have a separate apic_intr_mode_init() function for it.

The invocation time stays the same for now.
