lightnvm: pblk: free full lines during recovery

When rebuilding the L2P table, any full lines (lines without any
valid sectors) will be identified. If these lines are not freed,
we risk not being able to allocate the first data line.

This patch refactors the part of GC that frees empty lines
into a separate function and adds a call to this after the
L2P table has been rebuilt.
