ACPI / PMIC: Add TI PMIC TPS68470 operation region driver

The Kabylake platform coreboot (Chrome OS equivalent of
BIOS) has defined 4 operation regions for the TI TPS68470 PMIC.
These operation regions are to enable/disable voltage
regulators, configure voltage regulators, enable/disable
clocks and to configure clocks.

This config adds ACPI operation region support for TI TPS68470 PMIC.
TPS68470 device is an advanced power management unit that powers
a Compact Camera Module (CCM), generates clocks for image sensors,
drives a dual LED for flash and incorporates two LED drivers for
general purpose indicators.

This driver enables ACPI operation region support to control voltage
regulators and clocks for the TPS68470 PMIC.
