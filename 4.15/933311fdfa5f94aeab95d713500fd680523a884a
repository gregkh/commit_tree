ARM: davinci: da8xx-dt: Add OF_DEV_AUXDATA entry for DSP clock matching

Add the OF_DEV_AUXDATA entry needed to match the device-tree DSP node
to its non-device-tree clock, so that the da8xx-remoteproc driver can
properly enable the clocks. The device name has also been assigned
"davinci-rproc.0" to match the device id used in the da850_clks
clk_lookup array.
