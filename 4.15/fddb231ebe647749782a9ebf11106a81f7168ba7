ila: Add a hook type for LWT routes

In LWT tunnels both an input and output route method is defined.
If both of these are executed in the same path then double translation
happens and the effect is not correct.

This patch adds a new attribute that indicates the hook type. Two
values are defined for route output and route output. ILA
translation is only done for the one that is set. The default is
to enable ILA on route output.
