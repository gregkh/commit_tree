IB/mlx5: Add tunneling offloads support

The device can support receive Stateless Offloads for the inner
packet's fields only when the packet is processed by TIR which is
enabled to support tunneling. Otherwise, the device treats the
packet as an ordinary non-tunneling packet and receive offloads
can be done only for the outer packet's field.
In order to enable receive Stateless Offloading support for incoming
tunneling traffic the TIR should be created with tunneled_offload_en.
Tunneling offloads is supported only be raw ethernet QP.

This patch includes:
* New QP creation flag for tunneling offloads.
* Reports device capabilities.
