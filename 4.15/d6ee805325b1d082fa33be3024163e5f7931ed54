ARM: dts: iwg22d-sodimm: Add Ethernet AVB support

Define the iWave RainboW-G22D board dependent part of the Ethernet
AVB device node.

On some older versions of the platform (before R4.0) the phy address
may be 1 or 3. The address is fixed to 3 for R4.0 onwards (which
will be the first mainstream release), hence using 3 in the dts.
