iommu/iova: Make rcache limit_pfn handling more robust

When popping a pfn from an rcache, we are currently checking it directly
against limit_pfn for viability. Since this represents iova->pfn_lo, it
is technically possible for the corresponding iova->pfn_hi to be greater
than limit_pfn. Although we generally get away with it in practice since
limit_pfn is typically a power-of-two boundary and the IOVAs are
size-aligned, it's pretty trivial to make the iova_rcache_get() path
take the allocation size into account for complete safety.
