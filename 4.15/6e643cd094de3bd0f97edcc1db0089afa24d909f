xfs: hold xfs_buf locked between shortform->leaf conversion and the addition of an attribute

The new attribute leaf buffer is not held locked across the transaction
roll between the shortform->leaf modification and the addition of the
new entry.  As a result, the attribute buffer modification being made is
not atomic from an operational perspective.  Hence the AIL push can grab
it in the transient state of "just created" after the initial
transaction is rolled, because the buffer has been released.  This leads
to xfs_attr3_leaf_verify() asserting that hdr.count is zero, treating
this as in-memory corruption, and shutting down the filesystem.

Darrick ported the original patch to 4.15 and reworked it use the
xfs_defer_bjoin helper and hold/join the buffer correctly across the
second transaction roll.
