afs: Keep and pass sockaddr_rxrpc addresses rather than in_addr

Keep and pass sockaddr_rxrpc addresses around rather than keeping and
passing in_addr addresses to allow for the use of IPv6 and non-standard
port numbers in future.

This also allows the port and service_id fields to be removed from the
afs_call struct.
