crypto: aesni - make arrays aesni_simd_skciphers and aesni_simd_skciphers2 static

Arrays aesni_simd_skciphers and aesni_simd_skciphers2 are local to the
source and do not need to be in global scope, so make them static.

Cleans up sparse warnings:
symbol 'aesni_simd_skciphers' was not declared. Should it be static?
symbol 'aesni_simd_skciphers2' was not declared. Should it be static?
