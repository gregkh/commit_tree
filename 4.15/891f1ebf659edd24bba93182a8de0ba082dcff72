KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Explicitly disable HPT operations on radix guests

This adds code to make sure that we don't try to access the
non-existent HPT for a radix guest using the htab file for the VM
in debugfs, a file descriptor obtained using the KVM_PPC_GET_HTAB_FD
ioctl, or via the KVM_PPC_RESIZE_HPT_{PREPARE,COMMIT} ioctls.

At present nothing bad happens if userspace does access these
interfaces on a radix guest, mostly because kvmppc_hpt_npte()
gives 0 for a radix guest, which in turn is because 1 << -4
comes out as 0 on POWER processors.  However, that relies on
undefined behaviour, so it is better to be explicit about not
accessing the HPT for a radix guest.
