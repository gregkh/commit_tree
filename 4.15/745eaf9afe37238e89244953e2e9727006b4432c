nfp: fix vlan receive MAC statistics typo

Correct typo in vlan receive MAC stats. Previously the MAC statistics
reported in ethtool for vlan receive contained a typo resulting in ethtool
reporting rx_vlan_reveive_ok instead of rx_vlan_received_ok.

Fixes: a5950182c00e ("nfp: map mac_stats and vf_cfg BARs")
Fixes: 098ce840c9ef ("nfp: report MAC statistics in ethtool")
