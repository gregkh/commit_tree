md: move suspend_hi/lo handling into core md code

responding to ->suspend_lo and ->suspend_hi is similar
to responding to ->suspended.  It is best to wait in
the common core code without incrementing ->active_io.
This allows mddev_suspend()/mddev_resume() to work while
requests are waiting for suspend_lo/hi to change.
This is will be important after a subsequent patch
which uses mddev_suspend() to synchronize updating for
suspend_lo/hi.

So move the code for testing suspend_lo/hi out of raid1.c
and raid5.c, and place it in md.c
