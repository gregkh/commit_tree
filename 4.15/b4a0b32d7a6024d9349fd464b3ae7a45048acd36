drm/i915: Flush the idle-worker for debugfs/i915_drop_caches

After being requested to idle the GPU, flush the idle worker to drop the
residual active state, and any internal object caches.

v2: By popular demand, introduce DROP_IDLE for fine-grained control from
userspace, though it should be used as part of a
	DROP_ACTIVE | DROP_RETIRE | DROP_IDLE | DROP_FREED
sequence.
v3: Convert to BIT() to sell it to Joonas.
