of: overlay: minor restructuring

Continue improving the readability of overlay.c.  The previous patches
renamed identifiers.  This patch is split out from the previous patches
to make the previous patches easier to review.

Changes are:
  - minor code restructuring
  - some initialization of an overlay changeset occurred outside of
    init_overlay_changeset(), move that into init_overlay_changeset()
  - consolidate freeing an overlay changeset into free_overlay_changeset()

This patch is intended to not introduce any functional change.
