crypto: introduce crypto wait for async op

Invoking a possibly async. crypto op and waiting for completion
while correctly handling backlog processing is a common task
in the crypto API implementation and outside users of it.

This patch adds a generic implementation for doing so in
preparation for using it across the board instead of hand
rolled versions.
