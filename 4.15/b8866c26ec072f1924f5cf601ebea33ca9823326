drm/amdgpu: implement ring set_priority for gfx_v8 compute v9

Programming CP_HQD_QUEUE_PRIORITY enables a queue to take priority over
other queues on the same pipe. Multiple queues on a pipe are timesliced
so this gives us full precedence over other queues.

Programming CP_HQD_PIPE_PRIORITY changes the SPI_ARB_PRIORITY of the
wave as follows:
        0x2: CS_H
        0x1: CS_M
        0x0: CS_L

The SPI block will then dispatch work according to the policy set by
SPI_ARB_PRIORITY. In the current policy CS_H is higher priority than
gfx.

In order to prevent getting stuck in loops of resources bouncing between
GFX and high priority compute and introducing further latency, we
statically reserve a portion of the pipe.

v2: fix srbm_select to ring->queue and use ring->funcs->type
v3: use AMD_SCHED_PRIORITY_* instead of AMDGPU_CTX_PRIORITY_*
v4: switch int to enum amd_sched_priority
v5: corresponding changes for srbm_lock
v6: change CU reservation to PIPE_PERCENT allocation
v7: use kiq instead of MMIO
v8: back to MMIO, and make the implementation sleep safe.
v9: corresponding changes for splitting HIGH into _HW/_SW
