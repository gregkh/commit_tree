usb: host: xhci support option to disable the xHCI USB2 HW LPM

XHCI specification 1.1 does not require xHCI-compliant controllers
to always enable hardware USB2 LPM. However, the current xHCI
driver always enable it when seeing HLC=1.
This patch supports an option for users to control disabling
USB2 Hardware LPM via DT/ACPI attribute.
This option is needed in case user would like to disable this
feature. For example, their xHCI controller has its USB2 HW LPM
broken.
