dccp: don't restart ccid2_hc_tx_rto_expire() if sk in closed state

ccid2_hc_tx_rto_expire() timer callback always restarts the timer
again and can run indefinitely (unless it is stopped outside), and after
commit 120e9dabaf55 ("dccp: defer ccid_hc_tx_delete() at dismantle time"),
which moved ccid_hc_tx_delete() (also includes sk_stop_timer()) from
dccp_destroy_sock() to sk_destruct(), this started to happen quite often.
The timer prevents releasing the socket, as a result, sk_destruct() won't
be called.

Found with LTP/dccp_ipsec tests running on the bonding device,
which later couldn't be unloaded after the tests were completed:

  unregister_netdevice: waiting for bond0 to become free. Usage count = 148
