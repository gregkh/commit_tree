bpf: offload: ignore namespace moves

We are currently destroying the device offload state when device
moves to another net namespace.  This doesn't break with current
NFP code, because offload state is not used on program removal,
but it's not correct behaviour.

Ignore the device unregister notifications on namespace move.
