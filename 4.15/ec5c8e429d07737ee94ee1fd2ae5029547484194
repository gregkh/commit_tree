arm_arch_timer: Expose event stream status

The arch timer configuration for a CPU might get reset after suspending
said CPU.

In order to reliably use the event stream in the kernel (e.g. for delays),
we keep track of the state where we can safely consider the event stream as
properly configured. After writing to cntkctl, we issue an ISB to ensure
that subsequent delay loops can rely on the event stream being enabled.
