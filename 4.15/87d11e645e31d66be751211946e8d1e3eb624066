NTB: switchtec_ntb: Add memory window support

The Switchtec hardware has two types of memory windows: LUTs and Direct.
The first area in each BAR is for LUT windows and the remaining area is
for the direct region. The total number of LUT entries is set by a
configuration setting in hardware and they all must be the same
size. (This is fixed by switchtec_ntb to be 64K.)

switchtec_ntb enables the LUTs only for the first BAR and enables the
highest power of two possible. Seeing the LUTs are at the beginning of
the BAR, the direct memory window's alignment is affected. Therefore,
the maximum direct memory window size can not be greater than the number
of LUTs times 64K. The direct window in other BARs will not have this
restriction as the LUTs will not be enabled there. LUTs will only be
exposed through the NTB API if the use_lut_mw parameter is set.

Seeing the Switchtec hardware, by default, configures BARs to be 4G a
module parameter is given to limit the size of the advertised memory
windows. Higher layers tend to allocate the maximum BAR size and this
has a tendency to fail when they try to allocate 4GB of contiguous
memory.
