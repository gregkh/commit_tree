i40e/i40evf: Revert "i40e/i40evf: bump tail only in multiples of 8"

This reverts commit 11f29003d6376fb123b7c3779dba49bb56fb0815.

I am reverting this as I am fairly certain this can result in a memory leak
when combined with the current page recycling scheme. Specifically we end
up attempting to allocate fewer buffers than we recycled and this results
in us rewinding the next to alloc pointer which leads to leaks when we
overwrite the rx_buffer_info when processing the next frame.
