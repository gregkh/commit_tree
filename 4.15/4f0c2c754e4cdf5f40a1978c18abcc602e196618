ARM: dts: imx6qdl-icore-rqs: Move Sound nodes to dtsi

imx6q, imx6dl icore-rqs modules share common sound nodes,
so move the sound nodes from imx6q-icore-rqs into dtsi so-that
both can share the common node details.

And also replace codec: sgtl5000@0a => sgtl5000: codec@a
on imx6q-icore-rqs.dts to [label:] node-name[@unit-address]
according to devicetree specification from ePAPER v1.1
