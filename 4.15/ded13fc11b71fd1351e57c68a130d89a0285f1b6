KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix migration and HPT resizing of HPT guests on radix hosts

This fixes two errors that prevent a guest using the HPT MMU from
successfully migrating to a POWER9 host in radix MMU mode, or resizing
its HPT when running on a radix host.

The first bug was that commit 8dc6cca556e4 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV:
Don't rely on host's page size information", 2017-09-11) missed two
uses of hpte_base_page_size(), one in the HPT rehashing code and
one in kvm_htab_write() (which is used on the destination side in
migrating a HPT guest).  Instead we use kvmppc_hpte_base_page_shift().
Having the shift count means that we can use left and right shifts
instead of multiplication and division in a few places.

Along the way, this adds a check in kvm_htab_write() to ensure that the
page size encoding in the incoming HPTEs is recognized, and if not
return an EINVAL error to userspace.

The second bug was that kvm_htab_write was performing some but not all
of the functions of kvmhv_setup_mmu(), resulting in the destination VM
being left in radix mode as far as the hardware is concerned.  The
simplest fix for now is make kvm_htab_write() call
kvmppc_setup_partition_table() like kvmppc_hv_setup_htab_rma() does.
In future it would be better to refactor the code more extensively
to remove the duplication.
