ASoC: Intel: move all ACPI match tables to common module

First step of cleaning, move all tables to soc-acpi-intel-match module.
The tables remain in separate files per platform to keep them
manageable. Skylake+ platforms are still handled elsewhere since
there is no conflict with SOF for now, but this will have to be
handled at a later point.
