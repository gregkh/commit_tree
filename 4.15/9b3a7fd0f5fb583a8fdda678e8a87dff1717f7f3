x86/intel_rdt: Add framework for better RDT UI diagnostics

Commands are given to the resctrl file system by making/removing
directories, or by writing to files.  When something goes wrong
the user is generally left wondering why they got:

   bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument

Add a new file "last_cmd_status" to the "info" directory that
will give the user some better clues on what went wrong.

Provide functions to clear and update last_cmd_status which
check that we hold the rdtgroup_mutex.

[ tglx: Made last_cmd_status static and folded back the hunk from patch 3
  	which replaces the open coded access to last_cmd_status with the
  	accessor function ]
