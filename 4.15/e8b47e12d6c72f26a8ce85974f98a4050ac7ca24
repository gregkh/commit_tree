ARM: 8707/1: NOMMU: Update MPU accessors to use cp15 helpers

Currently, inline assembly for accessing to MPU's cp15 lacks volatile
keyword which opens possibility to compiler to optimise such accesses
as soon as we start using them more intensively. Rather than fixing
inline asm, lets move MPU accessors to use cp15 helpers which do the
right thing.
