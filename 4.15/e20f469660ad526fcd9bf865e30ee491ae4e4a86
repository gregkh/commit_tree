liquidio: synchronize VF representor names with NIC firmware

LiquidIO firmware supports a vswitch that needs to know the names of the
VF representors in the host to maintain compatibility for direct
programming using external Openflow agents.  So, for each VF representor,
send its name to the firmware when it gets registered and when its name
changes.
