sctp: force the params with right types for sctp csum apis

Now sctp_csum_xxx doesn't really match the param types of these common
csum apis. As sctp_csum_xxx is defined in sctp/checksum.h, many sparse
errors occur when make C=2 not only with M=net/sctp but also with other
modules that include this header file.

This patch is to force them fit in csum apis with the right types.
