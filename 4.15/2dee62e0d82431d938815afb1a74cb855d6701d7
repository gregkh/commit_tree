ARM: dts: imx35-eukrea-mbimxsd35-baseboard: Fix the 'cd-gpios' property

The GPIO polarity is missing in the cd-gpios property.

Fix it, so that the following build warning is gone:

  DTC     arch/arm/boot/dts/imx35-eukrea-mbimxsd35-baseboard.dtb
arch/arm/boot/dts/imx35-eukrea-mbimxsd35-baseboard.dtb: Warning (gpios_property): cd-gpios property size (8) too small for cell size 2 in /soc/aips@53f00000/esdhc@53fb400
