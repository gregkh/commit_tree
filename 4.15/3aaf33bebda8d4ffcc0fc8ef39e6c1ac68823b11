ARM: avoid faulting on qemu

When qemu starts a kernel in a bare environment, the default SCR has
the AW and FW bits clear, which means that the kernel can't modify
the PSR A or PSR F bits, and means that FIQs and imprecise aborts are
always masked.

When running uboot under qemu, the AW and FW SCR bits are set, and the
kernel functions normally - and this is how real hardware behaves.

Fix this for qemu by ignoring the FIQ bit.
