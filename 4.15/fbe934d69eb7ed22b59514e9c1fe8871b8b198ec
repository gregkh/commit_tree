RISC-V: Build Infrastructure

This patch contains all the build infrastructure that actually enables
the RISC-V port.  This includes Makefiles, linker scripts, and Kconfig
files.  It also contains the only top-level change, which adds RISC-V to
the list of architectures that need a sed run to produce the ARCH
variable when building locally.
