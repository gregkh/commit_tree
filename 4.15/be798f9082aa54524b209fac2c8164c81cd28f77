xprtrdma: Decode credits field in rpcrdma_reply_handler

We need to decode and save the incoming rdma_credits field _after_
we know that the direction of the message is "forward direction
Reply". Otherwise, the credits value in reverse direction Calls is
also used to update the forward direction credits.

It is safe to decode the rdma_credits field in rpcrdma_reply_handler
now that rpcrdma_reply_handler is single-threaded. Receives complete
in the same order as they were sent on the NFS server.
