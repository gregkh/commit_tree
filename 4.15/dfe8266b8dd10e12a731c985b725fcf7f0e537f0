sh_eth: fix TSU resource handling

When switching  the driver to the managed device API,  I managed to break
the  case of a  dual Ether devices sharing a single TSU: the 2nd Ether port
wouldn't probe. Iwamatsu-san has tried to fix this but his patch was buggy
and he then dropped the ball...

The solution is to  limit calling devm_request_mem_region() to the first
of  the two  ports  sharing the same TSU, so devm_ioremap_resource() can't
be used anymore for the TSU resource...
