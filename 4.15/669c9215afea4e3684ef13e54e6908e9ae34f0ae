drm/atomic: Make async plane update checks work as intended, v2.

By always keeping track of the last commit in plane_state, we know
whether there is an active update on the plane or not. With that
information we can reject the fast update, and force the slowpath
to be used as was originally intended.

We cannot use plane_state->crtc->state here, because this only mentions
the most recent commit for the crtc, but not the planes that were part
of it. We specifically care about what the last commit involving this
plane is, which can only be tracked with a pointer in the plane state.

Changes since v1:
- Clean up the whole function here, instead of partially earlier.
- Add mention in the commit message why we need commit in plane_state.
- Swap plane->state in intel_legacy_cursor_update, instead of
  reassigning all variables. With this commit We know that the cursor
  is not part of any active commits so this hack can be removed.
