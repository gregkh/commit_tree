serial: pl011: Adopt generic flag to store auto RTS status

Back in 2010, commit 3b43816f685f ("ARM: 5933/1: amba-pl011: support
hardware flow control") added an autorts flag to this driver to store
whether automatic hardware flow control is requested.

In 2015, commit 391f93f2ec9f ("serial: core: Rework hw-assisted flow
control support") added a flag with identical functionality to generic
code.

Switch over to that flag and drop the driver-specific one.
