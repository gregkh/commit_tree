[media] rcar_drif: fix potential uninitialized variable use

Older compilers like gcc-4.6 may run into a case that returns
an uninitialized variable from rcar_drif_enable_rx() if that
function was ever called with an empty cur_ch_mask:

drivers/media/platform/rcar_drif.c:658:2: error: ‘ret’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=uninitialized]

Newer compilers don't have that problem as they optimize the
'ret' variable away and just return zero in that case.

This changes the function to return -EINVAL for this particular
failure, to make it consistent across all compiler versions.
In case gcc gets changed to report a warning for it in the
future, it's also a good idea to shut it up now.
