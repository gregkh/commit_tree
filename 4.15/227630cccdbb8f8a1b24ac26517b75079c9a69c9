Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Fix setting of irq trigger type

This commit fixes 2 issues with host-wake irq trigger type handling
in hci_bcm:

1) bcm_setup_sleep sets sleep_params.host_wake_active based on
bcm_device.irq_polarity, but bcm_request_irq was always requesting
IRQF_TRIGGER_RISING as trigger type independent of irq_polarity.

This was a problem when the irq is described as a GpioInt rather then
an Interrupt in the DSDT as for GpioInt-s the value passed to request_irq
is honored. This commit fixes this by requesting the correct trigger
type depending on bcm_device.irq_polarity.

2) bcm_device.irq_polarity was used to directly store an ACPI polarity
value (ACPI_ACTIVE_*). This is undesirable because hci_bcm is also
used with device-tree and checking for something like ACPI_ACTIVE_LOW
in a non ACPI specific function like bcm_request_irq feels wrong.

This commit fixes this by renaming irq_polarity to irq_active_low
and changing its type to a bool.
