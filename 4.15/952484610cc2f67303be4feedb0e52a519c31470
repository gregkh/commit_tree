liquidio: do not consider packets dropped by network stack as driver Rx dropped

netdev->rx_dropped was including packets dropped by napi_gro_receive.
If a packet is dropped by network stack, it should not be counted under
driver Rx dropped.

Made necessary changes to not include network stack drops under
netdev->rx_dropped.
