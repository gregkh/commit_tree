s390/debug: adjust coding style

The debug feature code hasn't been touched in ages and the code also
looks like this. Therefore clean up the code so it looks a bit more
like current coding style.

There is no functional change - actually I made also sure that the
generated code with performance_defconfig is identical.
A diff of old vs new with "objdump -d" is empty.

The code is still not checkpatch clean, but that was not the goal.
