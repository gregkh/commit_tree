drm/i915/execlists: Read the context-status HEAD from the HWSP

The engine also provides a mirror of the CSB write pointer in the HWSP,
but not of our read pointer. To take advantage of this we need to
remember where we read up to on the last interrupt and continue off from
there. This poses a problem following a reset, as we don't know where
the hw will start writing from, and due to the use of power contexts we
cannot perform that query during the reset itself. So we continue the
current modus operandi of delaying the first read of the context-status
read/write pointers until after the first interrupt. With this we should
now have eliminated all uncached mmio reads in handling the
context-status interrupt, though we still have the uncached mmio writes
for submitting new work, and many uncached mmio reads in the global
interrupt handler itself. Still a step in the right direction towards
reducing our resubmit latency, although it appears lost in the noise!

v2: Cannonlake moved the CSB write index
v3: Include the sw/hwsp state in debugfs/i915_engine_info
v4: Also revert to using CSB mmio for GVT-g
v5: Prevent the compiler reloading tail (Mika)
