time: Move time_t based interfaces to time32.h

Interfaces based on 'struct timespec' or 'struct timeval' should no
longer be used for new code, which can use either ktime_t or 'struct
timespec64' instead.

To make this a little clearer, this moves the various helpers into a new
time32.h header. For the moment, this gets included by the normal time.h,
but we may be able to separate it entirely when most users of time32.h
are gone.

Individual helpers in the new file can get removed once they become unused
in the future.

Since the contents of time32.h look a lot like what's in time64.h, I'm
reordering them during the move to make them more similar, and to allow
a follow-up patch to redirect the 'timespec' based functions to thei
'timespec64' based counterparts on 64-bit architectures later.
