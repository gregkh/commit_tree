sched/fair: Correct unit of load_above_capacity

In calculate_imbalance() load_above_capacity currently has the unit
[capacity] while it is used as being [load/capacity]. Not only is it
wrong it also makes it unlikely that load_above_capacity is ever used
as the subsequent code picks the smaller of load_above_capacity and
the avg_load

This patch ensures that load_above_capacity has the right unit
[load/capacity].
