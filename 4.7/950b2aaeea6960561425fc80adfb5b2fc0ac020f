drm/i915/gen9: add WaClearFlowControlGpgpuContextSave

This allows writes to EU flow control registers. Together
with SIP code from the user-mode driver this resolves a
hang seen in some pre-emption scenarios. Note that this
patch is just the kernel mode part of this workaround.

v2. Oops, add FLOW_CONTROL_ENABLE macro to i915_reg.h.
