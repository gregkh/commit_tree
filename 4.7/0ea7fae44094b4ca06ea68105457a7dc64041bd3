fm10k: use ethtool_rxfh_indir_default for default redirection table

The fm10k driver used its own code for generating a default indirection
table on device load, which was not the same as the default generated by
ethtool when indir_size of 0 is passed to SRXFH. Take advantage of
ethtool_rxfh_indir_default() and simplify code to write the redirection
table to reduce some code duplication.
