arm64: tegra: Remove 0, prefix from unit-addresses

When Tegra124 support was first merged the unit-addresses of all devices
were listed with a "0," prefix to encode the reg property's second cell.
It turns out that this notation is not correct, and the "," separator is
only used to separate fields in the unit address (such as the device and
function number in PCI devices), not individual cells for addresses with
more than one cell.
