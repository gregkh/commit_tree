watchdog: sp5100_tco: properly check for new register layouts

Commits 190aa4304de6 (Add AMD Mullins platform support) and
cca118fa2a0a94 (Add AMD Carrizo platform support) enabled the
driver on a lot more devices, but the following commit missed
a single location in the code when checking if the SB800 register
offsets should be used. This leads to the wrong register being
written which in turn causes ACPI to go haywire.

Fix this by introducing a helper function to check for the new
register layout and use this consistently.
