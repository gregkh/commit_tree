perf, bpf: minimize the size of perf_trace_() tracepoint handler

move trace_call_bpf() into helper function to minimize the size
of perf_trace_*() tracepoint handlers.
    text	   data	    bss	    dec	 	   hex	filename
10541679	5526646	2945024	19013349	1221ee5	vmlinux_before
10509422	5526646	2945024	18981092	121a0e4	vmlinux_after

It may seem that perf_fetch_caller_regs() can also be moved,
but that is incorrect, since ip/sp will be wrong.

bpf+tracepoint performance is not affected, since
perf_swevent_put_recursion_context() is now inlined.
export_symbol_gpl can also be dropped.

No measurable change in normal perf tracepoints.
