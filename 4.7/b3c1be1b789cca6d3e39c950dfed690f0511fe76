base: isa: Remove X86_32 dependency

Many motherboards utilize a LPC to ISA bridge in order to decode
ISA-style port-mapped I/O addresses. This is particularly true for
embedded motherboards supporting the PC/104 bus (a bus specification
derived from ISA).

These motherboards are now commonly running 64-bit x86 processors. The
X86_32 dependency should be removed from the ISA bus configuration
option in order to support these newer motherboards.

A new config option, CONFIG_ISA_BUS, is introduced to allow for the
compilation of the ISA bus driver independent of the CONFIG_ISA option.
Devices which communicate via ISA-compatible buses can now be supported
independent of the dependencies of the CONFIG_ISA option.
