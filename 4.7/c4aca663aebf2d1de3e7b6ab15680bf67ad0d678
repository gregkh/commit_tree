ARM: dts: imx6-tx6: remove container node around pinctrl nodes

Remove the function node around the pinctrl nodes that was obsoleted
by commit 5fcdf6a7ed95 ("pinctrl: imx: Allow parsing DT without
function nodes"), we can save this container node.

Also move the iomux node to the bottom of the file to improve
readability of the file.
