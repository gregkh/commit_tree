dmaengine: tegra-adma: Add support for Tegra210 ADMA

Add support for the Tegra210 Audio DMA controller that is used for
transferring data between system memory and the Audio sub-system.
The driver only supports cyclic transfers because this is being solely
used for audio.

This driver is based upon the work by Dara Ramesh <dramesh@nvidia.com>.
