MIPS: I6400: Icache fills from dcache

Coherence Manager 3 (CM3) as present in I6400 can fill icache lines
effectively from dirty dcaches, so there is no need to flush dirty lines
from dcaches through to L2 prior to icache invalidation.

Set the MIPS_CACHE_IC_F_DC flag such that cpu_has_ic_fills_f_dc
evaluates to true, which avoids those dcache flushes.
