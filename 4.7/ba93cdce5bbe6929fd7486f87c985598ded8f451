leds: triggers: Allow to switch the trigger to "panic" on a kernel panic

This commit adds a new led_cdev flag LED_PANIC_INDICATOR, which
allows to mark a specific LED to be switched to the "panic"
trigger, on a kernel panic.

This is useful to allow the user to assign a regular trigger
to a given LED, and still blink that LED on a kernel panic.
