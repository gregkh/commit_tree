tcp: accept SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_ID for passive TFO

SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_ID is set to get data-independent IDs
to associate timestamps with send calls. For TCP connections,
tp->snd_una is used as the starting point to calculate
relative IDs.

This socket option will fail if set before the handshake on a
passive TCP fast open connection with data in SYN or SYN/ACK,
since setsockopt requires the connection to be in the
ESTABLISHED state.

To address these, instead of limiting the option to the
ESTABLISHED state, accept the SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_ID option as
long as the connection is not in LISTEN or CLOSE states.
