MIPS: tools: Add relocs tool

This tool is based on the x86/boot/tools/relocs tool.

It parses the relocations present in the vmlinux elf file, building a
table of relocations that will be necessary to run the kernel from an
address other than its link address. This table is inserted into the
vmlinux elf, in the .data.relocs section. The table is subsequently used
by the code in arch/mips/kernel/relocate.c (added later) to relocate the
kernel.

The tool, by default, also marks all relocation sections as 0 length.
This is due to objcopy currently being unable to handle copying the
relocations between 64 and 32 bit elf files as is done when building a
64 bit kernel.
