xprtrdma: Save I/O direction in struct rpcrdma_frwr

Move the the I/O direction field from rpcrdma_mr_seg into the
rpcrdma_frmr.

This makes it possible to DMA-unmap the frwr long after an RPC has
exited and its rpcrdma_mr_seg array has been released and re-used.
This might occur if an RPC times out while waiting for a new
connection to be established.
