reservation: add reservation_object_get_excl_rcu()

In the atomic modesetting path, each driver simply wants to grab a ref
to the exclusive fence from a reservation object to store in the incoming
drm_plane_state, without doing the whole RCU dance.  Since each driver
will need to do this, lets make a helper.

v2: rename to _rcu instead of _unlocked to be more consistent
