udp: Add udp6_lib_lookup_skb and udp4_lib_lookup_skb

Add externally visible functions to lookup a UDP socket by skb. This
will be used for GRO in UDP sockets. These functions also check
if skb->dst is set, and if it is not skb->dev is used to get dev_net.
This allows calling lookup functions before dst has been set on the
skbuff.
