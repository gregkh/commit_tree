dmaengine: qcom_hidma: add debugfs hooks

Add debugfs hooks for debugging the execution behavior of the DMA
channel. The debugfs hooks get initialized by the probe function and
uninitialized by the remove function.

A stats file is created in debugfs. The stats file will show the
information about each HIDMA channel as well as each asynchronous job
queued and completed at a given time.
