Revert "ACPICA: ACPI 2.0, Hardware: Add access_width/bit_offset support for acpi_hw_write()"

Revert commit 66b1ed5aa8dd "ACPICA: ACPI 2.0, Hardware: Add
access_width/bit_offset support for acpi_hw_write()" that is reported
to break suspend-to-RAM (ACPI S3) on one system.

The root cause of the failure is a wrong access width value for one of
the involved registers provided by the ACPI tables, but before commit
66b1ed5aa8dd that value was not taken into account at all and things
worked.
