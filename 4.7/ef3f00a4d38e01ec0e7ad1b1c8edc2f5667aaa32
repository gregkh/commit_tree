perf/x86/intel/uncore: Remove WARN_ON_ONCE in uncore_pci_probe

When booting with nr_cpus=1, uncore_pci_probe tries to init the PCI/uncore
also for the other packages and fails with warning when they are not found.

The warning is bogus because it's correct to fail here for packages which are
not initialized. Remove it and return silently.
