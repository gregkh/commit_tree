mfd: arizona: Update device ordering to allow clean driver removal

Since this commit:

commit b9a8a271c38f ("mfd: make mfd_remove_devices() iterate in reverse
order")

The order in which the MFD children remove has been reversed, as our
driver contains some dependencies between the devices we need to make
some changes to ensure the driver unloads cleanly.
