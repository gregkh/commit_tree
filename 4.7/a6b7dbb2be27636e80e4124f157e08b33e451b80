staging: comedi: das1800: allow setting the external trigger polarity

The external pin TGIN can be used to start and/or stop the analog input
command. Currently the driver only supports negative edge polarity for
this signal.

Add support to allow the user to select positive edge polarity using
the CR_INVERT flag.
