drm/i915: Fix races on fbdev

The ->lastclose callback invokes intel_fbdev_restore_mode() and has
been witnessed to run before intel_fbdev_initial_config_async()
has finished.

We might likewise receive hotplug events before we've had a chance to
fully set up the fbdev.

Fix by waiting for the asynchronous thread to finish.

v2:
An async_synchronize_full() was also added to intel_fbdev_set_suspend()
in v1 which turned out to be entirely gratuitous. It caused a deadlock
on suspend (discovered by CI, thanks to Damien Lespiau and Tomi Sarvela
for CI support) and was unnecessary since a device is never suspended
until its ->probe callback (and all asynchronous tasks it scheduled)
have finished. See dpm_prepare(), which calls wait_for_device_probe(),
which calls async_synchronize_full().
