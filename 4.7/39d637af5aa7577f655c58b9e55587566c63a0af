vfs: forbid write access when reading a file into memory

This patch is based on top of the "vfs: support for a common kernel file
loader" patch set.  In general when the kernel is reading a file into
memory it does not want anything else writing to it.

The kernel currently only forbids write access to a file being executed.
This patch extends this locking to files being read by the kernel.

Changelog:
- moved function to kernel_read_file() - Mimi
- updated patch description - Mimi
