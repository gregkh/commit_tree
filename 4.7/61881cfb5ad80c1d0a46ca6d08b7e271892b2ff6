sock: fix lockdep annotation in release_sock

During release_sock we use callbacks to finish the processing
of outstanding skbs on the socket. We actually are still locked,
sk_locked.owned == 1, but we already told lockdep that the mutex
is released. This could lead to false positives in lockdep for
lockdep_sock_is_held (we don't hold the slock spinlock during processing
the outstanding skbs).

I took over this patch from Eric Dumazet and tested it.
