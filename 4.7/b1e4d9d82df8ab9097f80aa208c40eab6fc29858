debugobjects: make fixup functions return bool instead of int

I am going to introduce debugobjects infrastructure to USB subsystem.
But before this, I found the code of debugobjects could be improved.
This patchset will make fixup functions return bool type instead of int.
Because fixup only need report success or no.  boolean is the 'real'
type.

This patch (of 7):

The object debugging infrastructure core provides some fixup callbacks
for the subsystem who use it.  These callbacks are called from the debug
code whenever a problem in debug_object_init is detected.  And
debugobjects core suppose them returns 1 when the fixup was successful,
otherwise 0.  So the return type is boolean.

A bad thing is that debug_object_fixup use the return value for
arithmetic operation.  It confused me that what is the reall return
type.

Reading over the whole code, I found some place do use the return value
incorrectly(see next patch).  So why use bool type instead?
