i40e/i40evf: Add support for GSO partial with UDP_TUNNEL_CSUM and GRE_CSUM

This patch makes it so that i40e and i40evf can use GSO_PARTIAL to support
segmentation for frames with checksums enabled in outer headers.  As a
result we can now send data over these types of tunnels at over 20Gb/s
versus the 12Gb/s that was previously possible on my system.

The advantage with the i40e parts is that this offload is mostly
transparent as the hardware still deals with the inner and/or outer IPv4
headers so the IP ID is still incrementing for both when this offload is
performed.
