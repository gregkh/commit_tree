staging: lustre: libcfs: move function declarations from libcfs_ioctl.h

Move the function declartions that are used only by
kernel space to libcfs.h This makes libcfs_ioctl.h
a offical uapi header now.
Move large inline functions out of libcfs_ioctl.h to
the source file linux-module.c belonging to libcfs.
This code is only used by the core of libcfs and such
inline functions don't belong in a uapi header file.
