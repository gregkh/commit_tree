drm/i915: Do not read GAMMA_MODE register

the hardware's state.

v2: Read GAMMA_MODE register value at init (Matt Roper's comment)

v3: Read GAMMA_MODE register in intel_modeset_readout_hw_state along
    with other registers (Matt Roper's comment).

v4: Mask GAMMA_MODE register with interesting bits when reading
