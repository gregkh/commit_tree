IB/hfi1: Ignore non-temperature warnings on a downed link

QSFP modules can raise an interrupt to inform us of expected conditions
while the link is down, such as RX power low. Actively ignore these
conditions when the link is down as they only add reporting noise.
Continue reporting conditions that are valid at all times, such as
temperature alarms and warnings.
