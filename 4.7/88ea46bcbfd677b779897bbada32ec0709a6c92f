mmc: sdio: fall back to SDIO 1.0 for broken 1.1 cards

I have two SDIO WLAN cards which specify being SDIO Rev. 1.1 cards but
their FUNCE tuple reports the smaller size of a Rev 1.0 card. So,
enforce 1.0 on these cards to avoid reading the not present registers.
They are not really used anyhow. My cards initialize properly after this
patch.
