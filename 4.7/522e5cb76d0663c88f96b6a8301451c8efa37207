iommu/amd: Fix unity mapping initialization race

There is a race condition in the AMD IOMMU init code that
causes requested unity mappings to be blocked by the IOMMU
for a short period of time. This results on boot failures
and IO_PAGE_FAULTs on some machines.

Fix this by making sure the unity mappings are installed
before all other DMA is blocked.
