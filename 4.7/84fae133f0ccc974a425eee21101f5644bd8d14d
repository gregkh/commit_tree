drm/amdgpu: Replace rcu_assign_pointer() with RCU_INIT_POINTER()

The rcu_assign_pointer() ensures that the initialization of a structure
is carried out before storing a pointer to that structre. It is always
safe to use RCU_INIT_POINTER() to NULL a pointer, instead of
rcu_assign_pointer().
This results in slightly smaller/faster code.

The following semantic patch was used:
