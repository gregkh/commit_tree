cpuidle: Indicate when a device has been unregistered

Currently the 'registered' member of the cpuidle_device struct is set
to 1 during cpuidle_register_device. In this same function there are
checks to see if the device is already registered to prevent duplicate
calls to register the device, but this value is never set to 0 even on
unregister of the device. Because of this, any attempt to call
cpuidle_register_device after a call to cpuidle_unregister_device will
fail which shouldn't be the case.

To prevent this, set registered to 0 when the device is unregistered.
