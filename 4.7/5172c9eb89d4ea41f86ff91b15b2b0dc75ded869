dmaengine: qcom: bam_dma: add controlled-remotely dt property

Some of the peripherals has bam which is controlled by remote
processor, thus the bam dma driver must avoid register writes
which initialise bam hw block. Those registers are protected
from xPU block and any writes to them will lead to secure
violation and system reboot.

Adding the contolled_remotely flag in bam driver to avoid
not permitted register writes in bam_init function.
