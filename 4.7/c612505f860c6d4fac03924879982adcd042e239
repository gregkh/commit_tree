arm64: kvm: Fix kvm teardown for systems using the extended idmap

If memory is located above 1<<VA_BITS, kvm adds an extra level to its page
tables, merging the runtime tables and boot tables that contain the idmap.
This lets us avoid the trampoline dance during initialisation.

This also means there is no trampoline page mapped, so
__cpu_reset_hyp_mode() can't call __kvm_hyp_reset() in this page. The good
news is the idmap is still mapped, so we don't need the trampoline page.
The bad news is we can't call it directly as the idmap is above
HYP_PAGE_OFFSET, so its address is masked by kvm_call_hyp.

Add a function __extended_idmap_trampoline which will branch into
__kvm_hyp_reset in the idmap, change kvm_hyp_reset_entry() to return
this address if __kvm_cpu_uses_extended_idmap(). In this case
__kvm_hyp_reset() will still switch to the boot tables (which are the
merged tables that were already in use), and branch into the idmap (where
it already was).

This fixes boot failures on these systems, where we fail to execute the
missing trampoline page when tearing down kvm in init_subsystems():
