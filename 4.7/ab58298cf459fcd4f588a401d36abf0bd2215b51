net: fix decnet rtnexthop parsing

dn_fib_count_nhs() could enter an infinite loop if nhp->rtnh_len == 0
(i.e. if userspace passes a malformed netlink message).

Let's use the helpers from net/nexthop.h which take care of all this
stuff. We can do exactly the same as e.g. fib_count_nexthops() and
fib_get_nhs() from net/ipv4/fib_semantics.c.

This fixes the softlockup for me.
