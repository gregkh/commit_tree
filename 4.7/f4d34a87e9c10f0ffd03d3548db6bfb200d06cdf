tracing: Use pid bitmap instead of a pid array for set_event_pid

In order to add the ability to let tasks that are filtered by the events
have their children also be traced on fork (and then not traced on exit),
convert the array into a pid bitmask. Most of the time the number of pids is
only 32768 pids or a 4k bitmask, which is the same size as the default list
currently is, and that list could grow if more pids are listed.

This also greatly simplifies the code.
