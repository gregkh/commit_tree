powerpc/powernv: Track M64 segment consumption

When unplugging PCI devices, their parent PEs might be offline.
The consumed M64 resource by the PEs should be released at that
time. As we track M32 segment consumption, this introduces an
array to the PHB to track the mapping between M64 segment and
PE number.

Note: M64 mapping isn't covered by pnv_ioda_setup_pe_seg() as
IODA2 doesn't support the mapping explicitly while it's supported
on IODA1. Until now, no M64 is supported on IODA1 in software.
