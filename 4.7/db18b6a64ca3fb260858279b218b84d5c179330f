drm/i915/bxt: Fix DSI HW state readout

Currently the machine hangs during booting while accessing the
BXT_MIPI_PORT_CTRL register during pipe HW state readout. After some
experimentation I found that the hang is caused by the DSI PLL being
disabled, or it being enabled but with an incorrect divider
configuration. Enabling the PLL got rid of the boot problem, so fix
this by checking the PLL enabled state/configuration before attempting
to read out the HW state.

The DSI_PLL_ENABLE register is in the always-on power well, while the
BXT_DSI_PLL_CTL is in power well 0. This isn't exactly matched by the
transcoder power domain, but what we really need is just a runtime PM
reference, which is provided by any power domain.

Ville also found this dependency specified in BSpec, so I added a
reference to that too.

v2:
- Make sure we hold a power reference while accessing the PLL registers.
v3: (Jani)
- Simplify check in bxt_get_dsi_transcoder_state()
- Add comment explaining why we check for valid dividers in
  bxt_dsi_pll_is_enabled()
