tools: kvm_stat: Introduce pid monitoring

Having stats for single VMs can help to determine the problem of a VM
without the need of running other tools like perf.

The tracepoints already allowed pid level monitoring, but kvm_stat
didn't have support for it till now. Support for the newly implemented
debugfs vm monitoring was also implemented.
