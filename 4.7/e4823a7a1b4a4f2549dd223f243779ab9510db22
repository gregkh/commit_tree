KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: Add GICH_VMCR accessors

Since the GIC CPU interface is always virtualized by the hardware,
we don't have CPU interface state information readily available in our
emulation if userland wants to save or restore it.
Fortunately the GIC hypervisor interface provides the VMCR register to
access the required virtual CPU interface bits.
Provide wrappers for GICv2 and GICv3 hosts to have access to this
register.
