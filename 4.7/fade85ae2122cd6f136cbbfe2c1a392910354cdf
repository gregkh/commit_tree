drm/i915: Remove PCH type checks from ironlake_crtc_compute_clock()

The checks were added in commit 5dc5298bb3e5 ("drm/i915: add proper
CPU/PCH checks to crtc_mode_set functions") in a time when there was
doubts on what PCHs would be supported by HSW. There are similar checks
for PCH type in intel_detect_pch() and the function pointers are
initialized based on platform/pch information, so the removed WARN can't
ever be reached.

v2: Rebase without patch that drops lvds downclock code. (Ville)
