i40evf: refactor receive routine

This is part 2 of the Rx refactor series, just including
changes to i40evf.

This refactor aligns the receive routine with the one in
ixgbe which was highly optimized.  This reduces the code
we have to maintain and allows for (hopefully) more readable
and maintainable RX hot path.

In order to do this:
- consolidate the receive path into a single function that doesn't
  use packet split but *does* use pages for Rx buffers.
- remove the old _1buf routine
- consolidate several routines into helper functions
- remove VF ethtool control over packet split
- remove priv_flags interface since it is unused
