um: add extended processor state save/restore support

This patch extends save_fp_registers() and restore_fp_registers() to use
PTRACE_GETREGSET and PTRACE_SETREGSET with the XSTATE note type, adding
support for new processor state extensions between context switches.

When the new ptrace requests are unavailable, it falls back to the old
PTRACE_GETFPREGS and PTRACE_SETFPREGS methods, which have been renamed to
save_i387_registers() and restore_i387_registers().

Now these functions expect *fp_regs to have the space of an _xstate struct.
Thus, this also makes ptrace in UML responde to PTRACE_GETFPREGS/_SETFPREG
requests with a user_i387_struct (thus independent from HOST_FP_SIZE), and
by calling save_i387_registers() and restore_i387_registers() instead of
the extended save_fp_registers() and restore_fp_registers() functions.
