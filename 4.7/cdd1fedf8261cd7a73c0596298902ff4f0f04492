btrfs: add support for RENAME_EXCHANGE and RENAME_WHITEOUT

Two new flags, RENAME_EXCHANGE and RENAME_WHITEOUT, provide for new
behavior in the renameat2() syscall. This behavior is primarily used by
overlayfs. This patch adds support for these flags to btrfs, enabling it to
be used as a fully functional upper layer for overlayfs.

RENAME_EXCHANGE support was written by Davide Italiano originally
submitted on 2 April 2015.
