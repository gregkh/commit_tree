s390: fix info leak in do_sigsegv

Aleksa has reported incorrect si_errno value when stracing task which
received SIGSEGV:
[pid 20799] --- SIGSEGV {si_signo=SIGSEGV, si_code=SEGV_MAPERR, si_errno=2510266, si_addr=0x100000000000000}

The reason seems to be that do_sigsegv is not initializing siginfo
structure defined on the stack completely so it will leak 4B of
the previous stack content. Fix it simply by initializing si_errno
to 0 (same as do_sigbus does already).
