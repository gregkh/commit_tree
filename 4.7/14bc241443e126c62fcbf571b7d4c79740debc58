MIPS: Fix HTW config on XPA kernel without LPA enabled

The hardware page table walker (HTW) configuration is broken on XPA
kernels where XPA couldn't be enabled (either nohtw or the hardware
doesn't support it). This is because the PWSize.PTEW field (PTE width)
was only set to 8 bytes (an extra shift of 1) in config_htw_params() if
PageGrain.ELPA (enable large physical addressing) is set. On an XPA
kernel though the size of PTEs is fixed at 8 bytes regardless of whether
XPA could actually be enabled.

Fix the initialisation of this field based on sizeof(pte_t) instead.
