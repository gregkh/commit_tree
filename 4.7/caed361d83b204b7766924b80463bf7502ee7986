drm/i915: Fix watermarks for VLV/CHV

commit 92826fcdfc14 ("drm/i915: Calculate watermark related members in the crtc_state, v4.")
broke thigns by removing the pre vs. post wm update distinction. We also
lost the pre plane wm update entirely for VLV/CHV from the crtc enable
path.

This caused underruns on modeset and plane enable/disable on CHV,
and often those can lead to a dead pipe.

So let's bring back the pre vs. post thing, and let's toss in an
explicit wm update to valleyview_crtc_enable() to avoid having to
put it into the common code.

This is more or less a partial revert of the offending commit.
