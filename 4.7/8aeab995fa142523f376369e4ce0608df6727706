drm/arcpgu: use dedicated memory area for frame buffer

Now when ARC supports reserved memory areas and
per-device coherent DMA allocations we may switch ARC PGU
to use of those dedicated areas.

One of the benefits we may move frame-buffer area out
from IO Coherency aperture and so significantly
reduce IOC utilization allowing less demanding
peripherals to use all perks of IOC.
