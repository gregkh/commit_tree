mm: remove more IS_ERR_VALUE abuses

The do_brk() and vm_brk() return value was "unsigned long" and returned
the starting address on success, and an error value on failure.  The
reasons are entirely historical, and go back to it basically behaving
like the mmap() interface does.

However, nobody actually wanted that interface, and it causes totally
pointless IS_ERR_VALUE() confusion.

What every single caller actually wants is just the simpler integer
return of zero for success and negative error number on failure.

So just convert to that much clearer and more common calling convention,
and get rid of all the IS_ERR_VALUE() uses wrt vm_brk().
