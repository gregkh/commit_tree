tracing: Add check for NULL event field when creating hist field

Smatch flagged create_hist_field() as possibly being able to
dereference a NULL pointer, although the current code exits in all
cases where the event field could be NULL, so it's not actually a
problem.

Still, to prevent future changes to the code from overlooking new
cases, make the NULL pointer check explicit and warn once in that
case.
