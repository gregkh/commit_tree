perf evsel: Rename print_ip() to fprintf_sym()

As it receives a FILE, and its more than just the IP, which can even be
requested not to be printed.

For consistency with other similar methods in tools/perf/, name it as
perf_evsel__fprintf_sym() and make it return the number of bytes
printed, just like 'fprintf(3)'
