gpio: wm831x: use the new open drain callback

The WM831x GPIOs clearly have a dedicated open drain control
register. Implement support for controlling this from GPIO
descriptor tables or other hardware descriptions such as
device tree by implementing the .set_single_ended() callback.

Before this patch, lines requesting open drain will just be
switched to input mode by the framework, thus emulating open
drain. But the hardware can do the real thing, so let's
support that.

As part of this, rename the debugfs string for output mode
from "CMOS" to "push-pull" because it is the term used in
the framework to signify a tomem-pole CMOS output.
