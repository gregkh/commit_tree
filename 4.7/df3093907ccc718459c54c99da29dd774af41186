xfs: add configurable error support to metadata buffers

With the error configuration handle for async metadata write errors
in place, we can now add initial support to the IO error processing
in xfs_buf_iodone_error().

Add an infrastructure function to look up the configuration handle,
and rearrange the error handling to prepare the way for different
error handling conigurations to be used.
