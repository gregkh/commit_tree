IB/mlx4: Properly initialize GRH TClass and FlowLabel in AHs

When this code was reworked for IBoE support the order of assignments
for the sl_tclass_flowlabel got flipped around resulting in
TClass & FlowLabel being permanently set to 0 in the packet headers.

This breaks IB routers that rely on these headers, but only affects
kernel users - libmlx4 does this properly for user space.
