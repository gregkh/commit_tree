cpufreq: ppc_cbe_cpufreq_pmi: make the driver explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig for this driver is currently:

config CPU_FREQ_CBE_PMI
    bool "CBE frequency scaling using PMI interface"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by
anyone.  Lets remove the modular and unused code here, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
