perf symbols: Allow loading kallsyms without considering kcore files

Before the support for using /proc/kcore was introduced, the kallsyms
routines used /proc/modules and the first 'perf test' entry expected
finding maps for each module in the system, which is not the case with
the kcore code. Provide a way to ignore kcore files so that the test can
have its expectations met.

Improving the test to cover kcore files as well needs to be done.
