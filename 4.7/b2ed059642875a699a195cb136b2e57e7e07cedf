powerpc/pseries: Add null property check to pseries_discover_pic()

The return value of of_get_property() isn't checked before it is passed
to the strstr() function, if it happens that the return value is null
then this will result in a null pointer being dereferenced.

Add a check to see if the return value of of_get_property() is null and
if it is continue straight on to the next node.
