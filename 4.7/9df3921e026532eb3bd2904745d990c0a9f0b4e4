PM / Domains: Rename stop_ok to suspend_ok for the genpd governor

The genpd governor validates the latency constraints to find out whether
it's acceptable to runtime suspend a device. Earlier this validation was
made to know whether it was okay to invoke the ->stop() callback for the
device, hence the governor used the name "stop_ok" for the related
variables.

To clarify the code around this, let's rename these variables from
"stop_ok" to "suspend_ok".
