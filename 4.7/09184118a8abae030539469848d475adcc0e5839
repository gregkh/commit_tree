ASoC: hdmi-codec: Add hdmi-codec for external HDMI-encoders

The hdmi-codec is a platform device driver to be registered from
drivers of external HDMI encoders with I2S and/or spdif interface. The
driver in turn registers an ASoC codec for the HDMI encoder's audio
functionality.

The structures and definitions in the API header are mostly redundant
copies of similar structures in ASoC headers. This is on purpose to
avoid direct dependencies to ASoC structures in video side driver.
