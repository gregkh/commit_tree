libceph: a major OSD client update

This is a major sync up, up to ~Jewel.  The highlights are:

- per-session request trees (vs a global per-client tree)
- per-session locking (vs a global per-client rwlock)
- homeless OSD session
- no ad-hoc global per-client lists
- support for pool quotas
- foundation for watch/notify v2 support
- foundation for map check (pool deletion detection) support

The switchover is incomplete: lingering requests can be setup and
teared down but aren't ever reestablished.  This functionality is
restored with the introduction of the new lingering infrastructure
(ceph_osd_linger_request, linger_work, etc) in a later commit.
