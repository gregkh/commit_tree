isa: Call isa_bus_init before dependent ISA bus drivers register

The isa_bus_init function must be called before drivers which utilize
the ISA bus driver are registered. A race condition for initilization
exists if device_initcall is used (the isa_bus_init callback is placed
in the same initcall level as dependent drivers which use module_init).
This patch ensures that isa_bus_init is called first by utilizing
postcore_initcall in favor of device_initcall.
