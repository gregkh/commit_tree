btmrvl: add platform specific wakeup interrupt support

On some arm-based platforms, we need to configure platform specific
parameters by device tree node and also define our node as a child
node of parent SDIO host controller.
This patch parses these parameters from device tree. It includes
calibration data download to firmware, wakeup pin configured to firmware,
and soc specific wake up gpio, which will be set as wakeup interrupt pin.
