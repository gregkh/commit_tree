NVMe: Allow user initiated rescan

This exposes ioctl and sysfs methods a user can invoke to request the
driver rescan a controller and its namespaces. This is less harsh than
doing a controller reset, which temporarilly halts all IO, just to
surface a newly attached namespace.

This is mainly useful for controllers that implement the namespace
management command, but do not support the namespace notify change
asynchronous event notification.
