powerpc/iommu: Remove the dependency on EEH struct in DDW mechanism

Commit 39baadbf36ce ("powerpc/eeh: Remove eeh information from pci_dn")
changed the pci_dn struct by removing its EEH-related members.
As part of this clean-up, DDW mechanism was modified to read the device
configuration address from eeh_dev struct.

As a consequence, now if we disable EEH mechanism on kernel command-line
for example, the DDW mechanism will fail, generating a kernel oops by
dereferencing a NULL pointer (which turns to be the eeh_dev pointer).

This patch just changes the configuration address calculation on DDW
functions to a manual calculation based on pci_dn members instead of
using eeh_dev-based address.

No functional changes were made. This was tested on pSeries, both
in PHyp and qemu guest.
