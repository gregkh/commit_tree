ath10k: fix calibration init sequence of qca99x0

pre-calibration is meant for qca4019 which contains only caldata
whereas calibration file is used by ar9888 and qca99x0 that contains
both board data and caldata. So by definition both pre-cal-file and
cal-file can not coexist. Keeping them in shared memory (union), is
breaking boot sequence of qca99x0. Fix it by storing both binaries
in separate memories. This issue is reported in ipq8064 platform which
includes caldata in flash memory.
