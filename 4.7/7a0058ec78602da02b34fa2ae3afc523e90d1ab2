s390/kexec: consolidate crash_map/unmap_reserved_pages() and arch_kexec_protect(unprotect)_crashkres()

Commit 3f625002581b ("kexec: introduce a protection mechanism for the
crashkernel reserved memory") is a similar mechanism for protecting the
crash kernel reserved memory to previous crash_map/unmap_reserved_pages()
implementation, the new one is more generic in name and cleaner in code
(besides, some arch may not be allowed to unmap the pgtable).

Therefore, this patch consolidates them, and uses the new
arch_kexec_protect(unprotect)_crashkres() to replace former
crash_map/unmap_reserved_pages() which by now has been only used by
S390.

The consolidation work needs the crash memory to be mapped initially,
this is done in machine_kdump_pm_init() which is after
reserve_crashkernel().  Once kdump kernel is loaded, the new
arch_kexec_protect_crashkres() implemented for S390 will actually
unmap the pgtable like before.
