Btrfs: self-tests: Fix extent buffer bitmap test fail on BE system

In __test_eb_bitmaps(), we write random data to a bitmap. Then copy
the bitmap to another bitmap that resides inside an extent buffer.
Later we verify the values of corresponding bits in the bitmap and the
bitmap inside the extent buffer. However, extent_buffer_test_bit()
reads in byte granularity while test_bit() reads in unsigned long
granularity. Hence we end up comparing wrong bits on big-endian
systems such as ppc64. This commit fixes the issue by reading the
bitmap in byte granularity.
