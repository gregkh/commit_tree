rtc: zynqmp: Enable RTC switching to battery power when VCC_PSAUX is N/A

In order to conserve battery energy, during the PS operation,
it is expected that the supply for the battery-powered domain
to be switched from the battery (VCC_PSBATT) to (VCC_PSAUX) and
automatically be switched back to battery when VCC_PSAUX voltage
drops below a limit, doing so prevents the logic within
the battery-powered domain from functioning incorrectly.
