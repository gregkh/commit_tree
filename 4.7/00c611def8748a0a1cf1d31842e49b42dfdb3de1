Revert "ACPI 2.0 / AML: Improve module level execution by moving the If/Else/While execution to per-table basis"

Revert commit 3d4b7ae96d81 (ACPI 2.0 / AML: Improve module level
execution by moving the If/Else/While execution to per-table basis)
that enabled the execution of module-level AML after loading each
table (rather than after all AML tables have been loaded), but
overlooked locking issues resulting from that change.
