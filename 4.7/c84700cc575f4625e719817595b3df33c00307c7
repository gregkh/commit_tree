MIPS: Add missing tlbinvf/XPA microMIPS encodings

Hardcoded MIPS instruction encodings are provided for tlbinvf, mfhc0 &
mthc0 instructions, but microMIPS encodings are missing. I doubt any
microMIPS cores exist at present which support these instructions, but
the microMIPS encodings exist, and microMIPS cores may support them in
the future. Add the missing microMIPS encodings using the new macros.
