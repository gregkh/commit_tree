staging: lustre: ldlm: clean up l_flags

Remove the now obsolete LDLM_AST_FLAGS and LDLM_INHERIT_FLAGS defines.
Remove the obsolete LDLM_FL_HIDE_LOCK_MASK define.
Rename "local_only" mask to "off_wire" since it is confusingly similar
to a flag that (I think) means, "do not copy this lock over the wire."
