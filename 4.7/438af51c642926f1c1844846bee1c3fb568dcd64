ncr5380: Adopt uniform DMA setup convention

Standardize the DMA setup hooks so that the DMA implementation in
atari_NCR5380.c can be reconciled with pseudo DMA implementation in
NCR5380.c.

Calls to NCR5380_dma_recv_setup() and NCR5380_dma_send_setup() return
a negative value on failure, zero on PDMA transfer success and a positive
byte count for DMA setup success.

This convention is not entirely new, but is now applied consistently.

Also remove a pointless Status Register access: the *phase assignment is
redundant because after NCR5380_transfer_dma() returns control to
NCR5380_information_transfer(), that routine then returns control
to NCR5380_main(), which means *phase is dead.
