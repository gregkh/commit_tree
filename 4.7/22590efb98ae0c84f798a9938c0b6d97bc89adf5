intel_pstate: Avoid pointless FRAC_BITS shifts under div_fp()

There are multiple places in intel_pstate where int_tofp() is applied
to both arguments of div_fp(), but this is pointless, because int_tofp()
simply shifts its argument to the left by FRAC_BITS which mathematically
is equivalent to multuplication by 2^FRAC_BITS, so if this is done
to both arguments of a division, the extra factors will cancel each
other during that operation anyway.

Drop the pointless int_tofp() applied to div_fp() arguments throughout
the driver.
