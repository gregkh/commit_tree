bpf, trace: use READ_ONCE for retrieving file ptr

In bpf_perf_event_read() and bpf_perf_event_output(), we must use
READ_ONCE() for fetching the struct file pointer, which could get
updated concurrently, so we must prevent the compiler from potential
refetching.

We already do this with tail calls for fetching the related bpf_prog,
but not so on stored perf events. Semantics for both are the same
with regards to updates.
