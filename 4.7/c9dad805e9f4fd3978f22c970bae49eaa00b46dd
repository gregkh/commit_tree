batman-adv: Use kref_get for batadv_tvlv_container_get

batadv_tvlv_container_get requires that tvlv.container_list_lock is held by
the caller. It is therefore not possible that an item in
tvlv.container_list has an reference counter of 0 and is still in the list

The kref_get function instead WARNs (with debug information) when the
reference counter would still be 0. This makes a bug in batman-adv better
visible because kref_get_unless_zero would have ignored this problem.
