scsi_lib: correctly retry failed zero length REQ_TYPE_FS commands

When SCSI was written, all commands coming from the filesystem
(REQ_TYPE_FS commands) had data.  This meant that our signal for needing
to complete the command was the number of bytes completed being equal to
the number of bytes in the request.  Unfortunately, with the advent of
flush barriers, we can now get zero length REQ_TYPE_FS commands, which
confuse this logic because they satisfy the condition every time.  This
means they never get retried even for retryable conditions, like UNIT
ATTENTION because we complete them early assuming they're done.  Fix
this by special casing the early completion condition to recognise zero
length commands with errors and let them drop through to the retry code.
