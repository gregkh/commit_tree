ARC: [intc-compact] simplify code for 2 priority levels

ARC700 support for 2 interrupt priorities historically allowed even slow
perpherals such as emac and uart to setup high priority interrupts
which was wrong from the beginning as they could possibly delay the more
critical timer interrupt.

The hardware support for 2 level interrupts in ARCompact is less than
ideal anyways (judging from the "hacks" in low level entry code and thus
is not used in productions systems I know of.

So reduce the scope of this to timer only, thereby reducing a bunch of
complexity.
