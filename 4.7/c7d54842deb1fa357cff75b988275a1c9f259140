powerpc/mm: Use _PAGE_READ to indicate Read access

This splits the _PAGE_RW bit into _PAGE_READ and _PAGE_WRITE. It also
removes the dependency on _PAGE_USER for implying read only. Few things
to note here is that, we have read implied with write and execute
permission. Hence we should always find _PAGE_READ set on hash pte
fault.

We still can't switch PROT_NONE to !(_PAGE_RWX). Auto numa depends on
marking a prot none pte _PAGE_WRITE. (For more details look at
b191f9b106ea "mm: numa: preserve PTE write permissions across a NUMA
hinting fault")
