drivers: of: of_reserved_mem: fixup the CMA alignment not to affect dma-coherent

There was an alignment mismatch issue for CMA and it was fixed by
commit 1cc8e3458b51 ("drivers: of: of_reserved_mem: fixup the alignment with CMA setup").
However the way of the commit considers not only dma-contiguous(CMA) but also
dma-coherent which has no that requirement.

This patch checks more to distinguish dma-contiguous(CMA) from dma-coherent.
