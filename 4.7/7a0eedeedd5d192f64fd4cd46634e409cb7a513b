powerpc/mm/radix: Pick the address layout for radix config

Hash needs special get_unmapped_area() handling because of limitations
around base page size, so we have to set HAVE_ARCH_UNMAPPED_AREA.

With radix we don't have such restrictions, so we could use the generic
code. But because we've set HAVE_ARCH_UNMAPPED_AREA (for hash), we have
to re-implement the same logic as the generic code.
