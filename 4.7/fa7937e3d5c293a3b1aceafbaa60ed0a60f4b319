ath10k: update bss channel survey information

During hw scan, firmware sends two channel information events (pre-
complete, complete) to host for each channel change. The snap shot of cycle
counters (rx_clear and total) between these two events are given for
survey dump. In order to get latest survey statistics of all channels, a
scan request has to be issued. In general, an AP DUT is brought up, it
won't leave BSS channel except few cases like overlapping bss or radar
detection. So survey statistics of bss channel is always referring to
older data that are collected before starting AP (either ACS/OBSS scan).

To collect latest survey information from target, firmware provides WMI
interface to read cycle counters from hardware. For each survey dump
request, BSS channel cycle counters are read and cleared in hardware.
This makes sure that behavior is in align with ath9k survey report.
So survey dump always gives snap shot of cycle counters b/w two survey
requests.
