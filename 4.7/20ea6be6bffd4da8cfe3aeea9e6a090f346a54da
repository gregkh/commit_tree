dmaengine: of_dma: approximate an average distribution

Currently the following DT description would result in dmac0 always
being tried first and dmac1 second if dmac0 was unavailable. This
results in heavier use of dmac0 then of dmac1. This patch adds an
approximate average distribution over the two nodes lessening the load
of anyone of them.

   i2c6: i2c@e60b0000 {
           ...
           dmas = <&dmac0 0x77>, <&dmac0 0x78>,
                  <&dmac1 0x77>, <&dmac1 0x78>;
           dma-names = "tx", "rx", "tx", "rx";
           ...
   };
