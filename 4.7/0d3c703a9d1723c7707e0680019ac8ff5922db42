ipv6: Cleanup IPv6 tunnel receive path

Some basic changes to make IPv6 tunnel receive path look more like
IPv4 path:
  - Make ip6_tnl_rcv non-static so that GREv6 and others can call it
  - Make ip6_tnl_rcv look like ip_tunnel_rcv
  - Switch to gro_cells_receive
  - Make ip6_tnl_rcv non-static and export it
