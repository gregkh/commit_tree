staging: comedi: ni_mio_common: use 'unsigned int' instead of kernel types

Generally comedi drivers use 'unsigned int' types instead of the kernel type
'u32' for unsigned 32-bit values.

For aesthetics, change all the 'u32' and 'uin32_t' types and fix the
checkpatch.pl issues about:
CHECK: Prefer kernel type 'u32' over 'uint32_t'

The various i/o helpers use for reading and writing the 32/16/8-bit registers
all start with an 'unsigned int' value for writing and finally return an
'unsigned int' value. For aesthetics, change all the 'uint16_t' and 'uint8_t'
types for insigned int and fix the checkpatch.pl issues about:
CHECK: Prefer kernel type 'u16' over 'uint16_t'
