ACPICA: Divergence: remove unwanted spaces for typedef

ACPICA commit b2294cae776f5a66a7697414b21949d307e6856f

This patch removes unwanted spaces for typedef. This solution doesn't cover
function types.

Note that the linuxize result of this commit is very giant and should have
many conflicts against the current Linux upstream. Thus it is required to
modify the linuxize result of this commit and the commits around it
manually in order to have them merged to the Linux upstream. Since this is
very costy, we should do this only once, and if we can't ensure to do this
only once, we need to revert the Linux code to the wrong indentation result
before merging the linuxize result of this commit. Lv Zheng.
