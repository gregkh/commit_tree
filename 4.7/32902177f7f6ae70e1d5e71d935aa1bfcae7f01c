ASoC: dapm: deprecate MICBIAS widget type

Commit 086d7f804e26 ("ASoC: Convert WM8962 MICBIAS to a supply widget",
2011-09-23) says:

	A supply widget is generally clearer than a MICBIAS widget and a
	mic bias is just a type of supply so use a supply widget for the
	MICBIAS. This also avoids confusion with the routing when
	connected to multiple inputs.

but this has never been documented as a policy.  Add some comments to
make it clear.
