net/mlx5e: start/stop all tx queues upon open/close netdev

Start all tx queues (including inactive ones) when opening the netdev.
Stop all tx queues (including inactive ones) when closing the netdev.

This is a workaround for the tx timeout watchdog false alarm issue in
which the netdev watchdog is polling all the tx queues which may include
inactive queues and thus once lowering the real tx queues number
(ethtool -L) it will generate tx timeout watchdog false alarms.
