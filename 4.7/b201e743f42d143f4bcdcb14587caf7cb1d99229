drm: add missing drm_mode_set_crtcinfo call

When setting mode via MODE_ID property,
drm_atomic_set_mode_prop_for_crtc() does not call
drm_mode_set_crtcinfo() which possibly causes:

"[drm:drm_calc_timestamping_constants [drm]] *ERROR* crtc 32: Can't
calculate constants, dotclock = 0!"

Whether the error is seen depends on the previous data in state->mode,
as state->mode is not cleared when setting new mode.

This patch adds drm_mode_set_crtcinfo() call to
drm_mode_convert_umode(), which is called in both legacy and atomic
paths. This should be fine as there's no reason to call
drm_mode_convert_umode() without also setting the crtc related fields.

drm_mode_set_crtcinfo() is removed from the legacy drm_mode_setcrtc() as
that is no longer needed.
