File names with trailing period or space need special case conversion

POSIX allows files with trailing spaces or a trailing period but
SMB3 does not, so convert these using the normal Services For Mac
mapping as we do for other reserved characters such as
	: < > | ? *
This is similar to what Macs do for the same problem over SMB3.
