libnvdimm, dax: fix deletion

The ndctl unit tests discovered that the dax enabling omitted updates to
nd_detach_and_reset().  This routine clears device the configuration
when the namespace is detached.  Without this clearing userspace may
assume that the device is in the process of being configured by another
agent in the system.
