afs: Wait for outstanding async calls before closing rxrpc socket

The afs filesystem needs to wait for any outstanding asynchronous calls
(such as FS.GiveUpCallBacks cleaning up the callbacks lodged with a server)
to complete before closing the AF_RXRPC socket when unloading the module.

This may occur if the module is removed too quickly after unmounting all
filesystems.  This will produce an error report that looks like:

	AFS: Assertion failed
	1 == 0 is false
	0x1 == 0x0 is false
	------------[ cut here ]------------
