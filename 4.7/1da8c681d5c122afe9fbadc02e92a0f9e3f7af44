sunrpc: do not pull udp headers on receive

Commit e6afc8ace6dd modified the udp receive path by pulling the udp
header before queuing an skbuff onto the receive queue.

Sunrpc also calls skb_recv_datagram to dequeue an skb from a udp
socket. Modify this receive path to also no longer expect udp
headers.

Fixes: e6afc8ace6dd ("udp: remove headers from UDP packets before queueing")
