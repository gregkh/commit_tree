vfio/pci: Fix ordering of eventfd vs virqfd shutdown

Both the INTx and MSI/X disable paths do an eventfd_ctx_put() for the
trigger eventfd before calling vfio_virqfd_disable() any potential
mask and unmask eventfds.  This opens a use-after-free race where an
inopportune irqfd can reference the freed signalling eventfd.  Reorder
to avoid this possibility.
