IB/core: Introduce capabilitymask2 field in ClassPortInfo mad

Change struct ib_class_port_info to conform to IB Spec 1.3
That in order to get specific capability mask from ClassPortInfo mad.

>From the IB Spec, ClassPortInfo section:
        "CapabilityMask2 Bits 0-26: Additional class-specific capabilities...
         RespTimeValue the rest 5 bits"

The new struct now has one field for capabilitymask2 (previously was the
reserved field) and the resp_time field.

And it fixes up qib and srpt, use of the field repurposed to be used as
capabilitymask2:
IB/qib: Change pma_get_classportinfo
IB/srpt: Adjust the use of ib_class_port_info
