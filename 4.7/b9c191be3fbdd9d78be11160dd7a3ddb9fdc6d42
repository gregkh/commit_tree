ath10k: free cached fw bin contents when get board id fails

ath10k_core_probe_fw() simply returns error without freeing
cached firmware file content when get board id operation fails.
Free cached fw bin data in failure case to avoid memory leak.

Fixes: db0984e51a18 ("ath10k: select board data based on BMI chip id and board id")
