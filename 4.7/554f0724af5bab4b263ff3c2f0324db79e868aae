staging: lustre: lov: Don't wait for active target with OBD_STATFS_NODELAY

Patch for LU-631 which was landed before the upstream merge broke
OBD_STATFS_NODELAY behaviour. It adds unnecessary delay while
running df command with inactive OSTs. We shouldn't try to recover
connection to OST in this case.
