ARC: Make vmalloc size configurable

On ARC, lower 2G of address space is translated and used for
 - user vaddr space (region 0 to 5)
 - unused kernel-user gutter (region 6)
 - kernel vaddr space (region 7)

where each region simply represents 256MB of address space.

The kernel vaddr space of 256MB is used to implement vmalloc, modules
So far this was enough, but not on EZChip system with 4K CPUs (given
that per cpu mechanism uses vmalloc for allocating chunks)

So allow VMALLOC_SIZE to be configurable by expanding down into the unused
kernel-user gutter region which at default 256M was excessive anyways.

Also use _BITUL() to fix a build error since PGDIR_SIZE cannot use "1UL"
as called from assembly code in mm/tlbex.S
