parisc: get rid of superfluous __GFP_REPEAT

__GFP_REPEAT has a rather weak semantic but since it has been introduced
around 2.6.12 it has been ignored for low order allocations.

pmd_alloc_one allocate PMD_ORDER which is 1.  This means that this flag
has never been actually useful here because it has always been used only
for PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY requests.
