mm: enable RLIMIT_DATA by default with workaround for valgrind

Since commit 84638335900f ("mm: rework virtual memory accounting")
RLIMIT_DATA limits both brk() and private mmap() but this's disabled by
default because of incompatibility with older versions of valgrind.

Valgrind always set limit to zero and fails if RLIMIT_DATA is enabled.
Fortunately it changes only rlim_cur and keeps rlim_max for reverting
limit back when needed.

This patch checks current usage also against rlim_max if rlim_cur is
zero.  This is safe because task anyway can increase rlim_cur up to
rlim_max.  Size of brk is still checked against rlim_cur, so this part
is completely compatible - zero rlim_cur forbids brk() but allows
private mmap().
