documentation: Explain why rcu_read_lock() needs no barrier()

This commit adds a Quick Quiz whose answer explains why the compiler
code reordering enabled by CONFIG_PREEMPT=n's empty rcu_read_lock()
and rcu_read_unlock() functions does not hinder RCU's ability to figure
out which RCU read-side critical sections have completed and not.
