powerpc/mm: Convert pte_user() to static inline

In a subsequent patch we want to add a second definition of pte_user().
Before we do that, make the signature clear, ie. it takes a pte_t and
returns bool.

We move it up inside the existing #ifndef __ASSEMBLY__ block, but
otherwise it's a straight conversion.

Convert the call in settlbcam(), which passes an unsigned long, to pass
a pte_t.
