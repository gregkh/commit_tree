Btrfs: check if extent buffer is aligned to sectorsize

Thanks to fuzz testing, we can pass an invalid bytenr to extent buffer
via alloc_extent_buffer().  An unaligned eb can have more pages than it
should have, which ends up extent buffer's leak or some corrupted content
in extent buffer.

This adds a warning to let us quickly know what was happening.

Now that alloc_extent_buffer() no more returns NULL, this changes its
caller and callers of its caller to match with the new error
handling.
