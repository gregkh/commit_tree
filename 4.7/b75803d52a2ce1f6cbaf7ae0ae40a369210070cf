tcp: refactor struct tcp_skb_cb

Refactor tcp_skb_cb to create two overlaping areas to store
state for incoming or outgoing skbs based on comments by
Neal Cardwell to tcp_nv patch:

   AFAICT this patch would not require an increase in the size of
   sk_buff cb[] if it were to take advantage of the fact that the
   tcp_skb_cb header.h4 and header.h6 fields are only used in the packet
   reception code path, and this in_flight field is only used on the
   transmit side.
