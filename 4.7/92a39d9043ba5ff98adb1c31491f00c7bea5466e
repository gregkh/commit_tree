clk: composite: Add unregister function

The composite clock didn't have any unregistration function, which forced
us to use clk_unregister directly on it.

While it was already not great from an API point of view, it also meant
that we were leaking the clk_composite structure allocated in
clk_register_composite.

Add a clk_unregister_composite function to fix this.
