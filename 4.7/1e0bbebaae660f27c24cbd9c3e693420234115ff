mac80211: enable starting BA session with custom timeout

Currently the debugfs entry for starting aggregation session
starts it with timeout of 5 seconds. Allow opening a session
with a custom timeout (according to spec 0 is no timeout).
while at it, refactor the function and remove the magic numbers.
