iwlwifi: mvm: add more registers to dump upon error

Add UREG, RXFC, RFH, WMAL and RL2P registers to the prph dump
upon error. These regesiters could help to debug MSI-X and other
issues.

These register should be dumped only when multi-queue rx is supported
so separate the prph ranges static array to two different arrays,
and enable dumping different prph ranges according to run-time
decision.
