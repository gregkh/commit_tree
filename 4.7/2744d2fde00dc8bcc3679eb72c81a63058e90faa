hwmon: (dell-smm) Disallow fan_type() calls on broken machines

Some Dell machines have especially broken SMM or BIOS which cause that once
fan_type() is called then CPU fan speed going randomly up and down. And for
fixing this behaviour reboot is required.

So this patch creates fan_type blacklist of affected Dell machines and
disallow fan_type() call on them to prevent that erratic behaviour.

Old blacklist which disabled loading driver on some machines added in
commits a4b45b25f18d ("hwmon: (dell-smm) Blacklist Dell Studio XPS 8100")
and 6220f4ebd7b4 ("hwmon: (dell-smm) Blacklist Dell Studio XPS 8000") were
moved to FAN_TYPE blacklist.
