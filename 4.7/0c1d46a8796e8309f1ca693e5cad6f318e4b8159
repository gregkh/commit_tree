perf record: Disable buildid cache options by default in switch output mode

The cost of buildid cache processing is high: reading all events in
output perf.data, opening each elf file to read buildids then copying
them into ~/.debug directory. In switch output mode, these heavy works
block perf from receiving perf events for too long.

Enable no-buildid and no-buildid-cache by default if --switch-output is
provided. Still allow user use --no-no-buildid to explicitly enable
buildid in this case.
