s390: Clarify pagefault interrupt

While looking at set_task_state() users I stumbled over the s390 pfault
interrupt code.  Since Heiko provided a great explanation on how it
worked, I figured we ought to preserve this.

Also make a few little tweaks to the code to aid in readability and
explicitly comment the unusual blocking scheme.
