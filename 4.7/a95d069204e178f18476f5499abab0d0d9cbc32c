MIPS: Reserve nosave data for hibernation

After commit 92923ca3aacef63c92d ("mm: meminit: only set page reserved
in the memblock region"), the MIPS hibernation is broken. Because pages
in nosave data section should be "reserved", but currently they aren't
set to "reserved" at initialization. This patch makes hibernation work
again.
