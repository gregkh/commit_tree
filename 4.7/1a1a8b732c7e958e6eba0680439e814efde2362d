Btrfs: fix race setting block group back to RW mode during device replace

After it finishes processing a device extent, the device replace code sets
back the block group to RW mode and then after that it sets the left cursor
to match the logical end address of the block group, so that future writes
into extents belonging to the block group go both the source (old) and
target (new) devices. However from the moment we turn the block group
back to RW mode we have a short time window, that lasts until we update
the left cursor's value, where extents can be allocated from the block
group and written to, in which case they will not be copied/written to
the target (new) device. Fix this by updating the left cursor's value
before turning the block group back to RW mode.
