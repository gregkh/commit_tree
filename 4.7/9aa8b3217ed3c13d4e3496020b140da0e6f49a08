IB/core: Enhance ib_map_mr_sg()

The SRP initiator allows to set max_sectors to a value that exceeds
the largest amount of data that can be mapped at once with an mlx4
HCA using fast registration and a page size of 4 KB. Hence modify
ib_map_mr_sg() such that it can map partial sg-elements. If an
sg-element has been mapped partially, let the caller know
which fraction has been mapped by adjusting *sg_offset.
