hwmon: (fam15h_power) Add ptsc counter value for accumulated power

PTSC is the performance timestamp counter value in a cpu core and the
cores in one compute unit have the fixed frequency. So it picks up the
performance timestamp counter value of the first core per compute unit
to measure the interval for average power per compute unit.
