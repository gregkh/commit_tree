btrfs: Switch to generic xattr handlers

The btrfs_{set,remove}xattr inode operations check for a read-only root
(btrfs_root_readonly) before calling into generic_{set,remove}xattr.  If
this check is moved into __btrfs_setxattr, we can get rid of
btrfs_{set,remove}xattr.

This patch applies to mainline, I would like to keep it together with
the other xattr cleanups if possible, though.  Could you please review?

Thanks,
Andreas
