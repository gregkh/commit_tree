net: tilegx: use correct timespec64 type

The conversion to the 64-bit time based ptp methods left two instances
of 'struct timespec' in place. This is harmless because 64-bit
architectures define timespec64 as timespec, and this driver is
not used on 32-bit machines.

However, using 'struct timespec64' directly is obviously the right
thing to do, and will help us remove 'struct timespec' in the future.
