USB: xhci: Add broken streams quirk for Frescologic device id 1009

I got one of these cards for testing uas with, it seems that with streams
it dma-s all over the place, corrupting memory. On my first tests it
managed to dma over the BIOS of the motherboard somehow and completely
bricked it.

Tests on another motherboard show that it does work with streams disabled.
