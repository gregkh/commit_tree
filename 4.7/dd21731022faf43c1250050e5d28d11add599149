powerpc/sstep: Fix sstep.c compile on powerpcspe

Commit be96f63375a1 ("powerpc: Split out instruction analysis part of
emulate_step()") introduced ldarx and stdcx into the instructions in
sstep.c, which are not accepted by the assembler on powerpcspe, but does
seem to be accepted by the normal powerpc assembler even in 32 bit mode.

Wrap these two instructions in a __powerpc64__ check like it is
everywhere else in the file.
