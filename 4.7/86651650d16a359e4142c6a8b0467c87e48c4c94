net: nps_enet: Disable interrupts before napi reschedule

Since NAPI works by shutting down event interrupts when theres
work and turning them on when theres none, the net driver must
make sure that interrupts are disabled when it reschedules polling.
By calling napi_reschedule, the driver switches to polling mode,
therefor there should be no interrupt interference.
Any received packets will be handled in nps_enet_poll by polling the HW
indication of received packet until all packets are handled.
