powerpc/livepatch: Add livepatch header

Add the powerpc specific livepatch definitions. In particular we provide
a non-default implementation of klp_get_ftrace_location().

This is required because the location of the mcount call is not constant
when using -mprofile-kernel (which we always do for live patching).
