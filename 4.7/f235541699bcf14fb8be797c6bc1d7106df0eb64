export.h: allow for per-symbol configurable EXPORT_SYMBOL()

Similar to include/generated/autoconf.h, include/generated/autoksyms.h
will contain a list of defines for each EXPORT_SYMBOL() that we want
active. The format is:

  #define __KSYM_<symbol_name> 1

This list will be auto-generated with another patch.  For now we only
include the preprocessor magic to automatically create or omit the
corresponding struct kernel_symbol declaration.

Given the content of include/generated/autoksyms.h may not be known in
advance, an empty file is created early on to let the build proceed.
