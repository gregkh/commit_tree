gfs2: Switch to generic xattr handlers

Switch to the generic xattr handlers and take the necessary glocks at
the layer below. The following are the new xattr "entry points"; they
are called with the glock held already in the following cases:

  gfs2_xattr_get: From SELinux, during lookups.
  gfs2_xattr_set: The glock is never held.
  gfs2_get_acl: From gfs2_create_inode -> posix_acl_create and
                gfs2_setattr -> posix_acl_chmod.
  gfs2_set_acl: From gfs2_setattr -> posix_acl_chmod.
