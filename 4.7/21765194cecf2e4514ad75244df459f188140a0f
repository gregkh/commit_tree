ovl: Do d_type check only if work dir creation was successful

d_type check requires successful creation of workdir as iterates
through work dir and expects work dir to be present in it. If that's
not the case, this check will always return d_type not supported even
if underlying filesystem might be supporting it.

So don't do this check if work dir creation failed in previous step.
