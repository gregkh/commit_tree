6lowpan: iphc: fix handling of link-local compression

This patch fixes handling in case of link-local address compression. A
IPv6 link-local address is defined as fe80::/10 prefix which is also
what ipv6_addr_type checks for link-local addresses.

But IPHC compression for link-local addresses are for fe80::/64 types
only. This patch adds additional checks for zero padded bits in case of
link-local address compression to match on a fe80::/64 address only.
