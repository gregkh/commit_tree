tcp: replace cnt & rtt with struct in pkts_acked()

Replace 2 arguments (cnt and rtt) in the congestion control modules'
pkts_acked() function with a struct. This will allow adding more
information without having to modify existing congestion control
modules (tcp_nv in particular needs bytes in flight when packet
was sent).

As proposed by Neal Cardwell in his comments to the tcp_nv patch.
