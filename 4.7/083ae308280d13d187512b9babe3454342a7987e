tcp: enable per-socket rate limiting of all 'challenge acks'

The per-socket rate limit for 'challenge acks' was introduced in the
context of limiting ack loops:

commit f2b2c582e824 ("tcp: mitigate ACK loops for connections as tcp_sock")

And I think it can be extended to rate limit all 'challenge acks' on a
per-socket basis.

Since we have the global tcp_challenge_ack_limit, this patch allows for
tcp_challenge_ack_limit to be set to a large value and effectively rely on
the per-socket limit, or set tcp_challenge_ack_limit to a lower value and
still prevents a single connections from consuming the entire challenge ack
quota.

It further moves in the direction of eliminating the global limit at some
point, as Eric Dumazet has suggested. This a follow-up to:
