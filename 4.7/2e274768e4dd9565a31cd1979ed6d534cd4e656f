MIPS: Move RIXI exception enabling after vendor-specific cpu_probe

Some processors may not have the RIXI bit advertised in the Config3 register,
not being a MIPS32R2 or R6 core, yet, they might be supporting it through a
different way, which is overriden during vendor-specific cpu_probe().

Move the RIXI exceptions enabling after the vendor-specific cpu_probe()
function has had a change to run and override the current CPU's options with
MIPS_CPU_RIXI.
