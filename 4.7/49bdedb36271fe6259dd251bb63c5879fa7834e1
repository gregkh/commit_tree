skd: remove broken discard support

Simply creating a file system on an skd device, followed by mount and
fstrim will result in errors in the logs and then a BUG().  Let's remove
discard support from that driver.  As far as I can tell, it hasn't
worked right since it was merged.  This patch also has a side-effect of
cleaning up an unintentional shadowed declaration inside of
skd_end_request.

I tested to ensure that I can still do I/O to the device using xfstests
./check -g quick.  I didn't do anything more extensive than that,
though.
