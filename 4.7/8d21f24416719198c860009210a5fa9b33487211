doc: DT: Add Generic Serial Device Tree Bindings

Document a set of generic properties for describing UARTs in a
device tree:
  1. The GPIO modem control properties are currently duplicated across
     hardware-specific binding documentation,
  2. The property for dedicated RTS/CTS hardware flow control lines is
     already supported by several drivers, albeit with a vendor-specific
     prefix, hence make it generic.
