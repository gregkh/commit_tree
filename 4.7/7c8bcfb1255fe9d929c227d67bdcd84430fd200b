tipc: re-enable compensation for socket receive buffer double counting

In the refactoring commit d570d86497ee ("tipc: enqueue arrived buffers
in socket in separate function") we did by accident replace the test

if (sk->sk_backlog.len == 0)
     atomic_set(&tsk->dupl_rcvcnt, 0);

with

if (sk->sk_backlog.len)
     atomic_set(&tsk->dupl_rcvcnt, 0);

This effectively disables the compensation we have for the double
receive buffer accounting that occurs temporarily when buffers are
moved from the backlog to the socket receive queue. Until now, this
has gone unnoticed because of the large receive buffer limits we are
applying, but becomes indispensable when we reduce this buffer limit
later in this series.

We now fix this by inverting the mentioned condition.
