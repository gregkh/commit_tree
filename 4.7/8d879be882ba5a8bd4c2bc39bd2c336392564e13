ALSA: pcm: Bail out when chmap is already present

When snd_pcm_add_chmap_ctls() is called to the PCM stream to which a
chmap has been already assigned, it returns as an error due to the
conflicting snd_ctl_add() result.  However, this also clears the
already assigned chmap_kctl field via pcm_chmap_ctl_private_free(),
and becomes inconsistent in the later operation.

This patch adds the check of the conflicting chmap kctl before
actually trying to allocate / assign.  The check failure is treated as
a kernel warning, as the double call of snd_pcm_add_chmap_ctls() is
basically a driver bug and having the stack trace would help
developers to figure out the bad code path.
