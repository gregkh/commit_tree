Btrfs: btrfs_check_super_valid: Allow 4096 as stripesize

Older btrfs-progs/mkfs.btrfs sets 4096 as the stripesize. Hence
restricting stripesize to be equal to sectorsize would cause super block
validation to return an error on architectures where PAGE_SIZE is not
equal to 4096.

Hence as a workaround, this commit allows stripesize to be set to 4096
bytes.
