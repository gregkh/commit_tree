acpi: widen acpi_evaluate_dsm() revision and function-index arguments

The ACPI specification states that arguments "Revision ID" and "Function
Index" to a _DSM are type "Integer."  Type Integers are 64 bit
quantities.

The function evaluate_dsm specifies these types as simple "int" which
are 32 bits.  Widen type passed to acpi_evaluate_dsm and its callers and
derived callers to pass correct type.

acpi_check_dsm and acpi_evaluate_dsm_typed had similar issue and were
corrected as well.

This is in preparation for libnvdimm implementing a generic _DSM
passthrough facility to have the capacity to pass 64-bit values as the
ACPI specification allows.
