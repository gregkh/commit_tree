ocfs2: fix improper handling of return errno

Previously, if a bad inode was found in ocfs2_iget(), -ESTALE was
returned back to the caller anyway.  Since commit d2b9d71a2da7 ("ocfs2:
check/fix inode block for online file check") can handle with return
value from ocfs2_read_locked_inode() now, we know the exact errno
returned for us.
