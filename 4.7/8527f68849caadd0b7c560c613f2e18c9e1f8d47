wcn36xx: Set SMD timeout to 10 seconds

After booting the wireless subsystem and uploading the NV blob to the
WCNSS_CTRL service the remote continues to do things and will not start
servicing wlan-requests for another 2-5 seconds (measured).

The downstream code does not have any special handling for this case,
but has a timeout of 10 seconds for the communication layer. By
extending the wcn36xx timeout to match this we follows the same flow for
the boot procedure and can successfully configure WiFi as wlan0 is
registered.
