efi: ARM/arm64: ignore DT memory nodes instead of removing them

There are two problems with the UEFI stub DT memory node removal
routine:
- it deletes nodes as it traverses the tree, which happens to work
  but is not supported, as deletion invalidates the node iterator;
- deleting memory nodes entirely may discard annotations in the form
  of additional properties on the nodes.

Since the discovery of DT memory nodes occurs strictly before the
UEFI init sequence, we can simply clear the memblock memory table
before parsing the UEFI memory map. This way, it is no longer
necessary to remove the nodes, so we can remove that logic from the
stub as well.
