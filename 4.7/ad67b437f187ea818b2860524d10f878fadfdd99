PCI: Disable all BAR sizing for devices with non-compliant BARs

b84106b4e229 ("PCI: Disable IO/MEM decoding for devices with non-compliant
BARs") disabled BAR sizing for BARs 0-5 of devices that don't comply with
the PCI spec.  But it didn't do anything for expansion ROM BARs, so we
still try to size them, resulting in warnings like this on Broadwell-EP:

  pci 0000:ff:12.0: BAR 6: failed to assign [mem size 0x00000001 pref]

Move the non-compliant BAR check from __pci_read_base() up to
pci_read_bases() so it applies to the expansion ROM BAR as well as
to BARs 0-5.

Note that direct callers of __pci_read_base(), like sriov_init(), will now
bypass this check.  We haven't had reports of devices with broken SR-IOV
BARs yet.
