ovl: xattr filter fix

a) ovl_need_xattr_filter() is wrong, we can have multiple lower layers
overlaid, all of which (except the lowest one) honouring the
"trusted.overlay.opaque" xattr.  So need to filter everything except the
bottom and the pure-upper layer.

b) we no longer can assume that inode is attached to dentry in
get/setxattr.

This patch unconditionally filters private xattrs to fix both of the above.
Performance impact for get/removexattrs is likely in the noise.

For listxattrs it might be measurable in pathological cases, but I very
much hope nobody cares.  If they do, we'll fix it then.
