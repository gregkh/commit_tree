atari_scsi: Allow can_queue to be increased for Falcon

The benefit of limiting can_queue to 1 is that atari_scsi shares the
ST DMA chip more fairly with other drivers (e.g. falcon-ide).

Unfortunately, this can limit SCSI bus utilization. On systems without
IDE, atari_scsi should issue SCSI commands whenever it can arbitrate for
the bus. Make that possible by making can_queue configurable.
