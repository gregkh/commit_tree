drm/i915: Move the mb() following release-mmap into release-mmap

As paranoia, we want to ensure that the CPU's PTEs have been revoked for
the object before we return from i915_gem_release_mmap(). This allows us
to rely on there being no outstanding memory accesses from userspace
and guarantees serialisation of the code against concurrent access just
by calling i915_gem_release_mmap().

v2: Reduce the mb() into a wmb() following the revoke.
