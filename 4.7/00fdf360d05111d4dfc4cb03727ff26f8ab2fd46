    libdrm: Make some drm headers compatible with gcc -std=c89 -pedantic

    The following minor changes were needed to these headers:
     * Convert // comments to /* */
     * No , after final member of enum

    With these changes, these header files can be included by a program that
    is built with gcc options:
      -std=c89 -Werror -pedantic
