documentation: Get rid of duplicate .htmlx file

This commit uses colors to obscure the quick-quiz answers, thus getting
rid of the .htmlx file.  Use your mouse to select the answer in order
to see the text.  Alternatively, use your favorite scripting language
to remove all occurences of "<font color="ffffff">" from the file.
