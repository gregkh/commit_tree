IB/srp: Avoid that mapping failure triggers an infinite loop

The srp_queuecommand() function translates ENOMEM into QUEUE_FULL
which causes the SCSI mid-layer to retry the command. All other
error codes are translated into DID_ERROR which causes the SCSI
command to fail. Return E2BIG if mapping will always fail to
prevent that the SCSI mid-layer keeps resubmitting a command
forever.
