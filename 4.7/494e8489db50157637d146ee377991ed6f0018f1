ipvlan: Fix failure path in dev registration during link creation

When newlink creation fails at device-registration, the port->count
is decremented twice. Francesco Ruggeri (fruggeri@arista.com) found
this issue in Macvlan and the same exists in IPvlan driver too.

While fixing this issue I noticed another issue of missing unregister
in case of failure, so adding it to the fix which is similar to the
macvlan fix by Francesco in commit 308379607548 ("macvlan: fix failure
during registration v3")
