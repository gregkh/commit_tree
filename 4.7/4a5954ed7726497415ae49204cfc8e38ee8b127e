powerpc/pci: Don't scan empty slot

In hotplug case, function pci_add_pci_devices() is called to rescan
the specified PCI bus, which might not have any child devices. Access
to the PCI bus's child device node will cause kernel crash without
exception.

This adds one more check to skip scanning PCI bus that doesn't have
any subordinate devices from device-tree, in order to avoid kernel
crash.
