debugfs: unproxify files created through debugfs_create_blob()

Currently, the struct file_operations fops_blob associated with files
created through the debugfs_create_blob() helpers are not file
lifetime aware.

Thus, a lifetime managing proxy is created around fops_blob each time such
a file is opened which is an unnecessary waste of resources.

Implement file lifetime management for the fops_bool file_operations.
Namely, make read_file_blob() safe gainst file removals by means of
debugfs_use_file_start() and debugfs_use_file_finish().

Make debugfs_create_blob() create its files in non-proxying operation mode
by means of debugfs_create_file_unsafe().
