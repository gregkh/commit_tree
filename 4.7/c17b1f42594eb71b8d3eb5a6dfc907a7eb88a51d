hugetlb: fix nr_pmds accounting with shared page tables

We account HugeTLB's shared page table to all processes who share it.
The accounting happens during huge_pmd_share().

If somebody populates pud entry under us, we should decrease pagetable's
refcount and decrease nr_pmds of the process.

By mistake, I increase nr_pmds again in this case.  :-/ It will lead to
"BUG: non-zero nr_pmds on freeing mm: 2" on process' exit.

Let's fix this by increasing nr_pmds only when we're sure that the page
table will be used.
