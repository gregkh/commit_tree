drm/core: Do not preserve framebuffer on rmfb, v4.

It turns out that preserving framebuffers after the rmfb call breaks
vmwgfx userspace. This was originally introduced because it was thought
nobody relied on the behavior, but unfortunately it seems there are
exceptions.

drm_framebuffer_remove may fail with -EINTR now, so a straight revert
is impossible. There is no way to remove the framebuffer from the lists
and active planes without introducing a race because of the different
locking requirements. Instead call drm_framebuffer_remove from a
workqueue, which is unaffected by signals.

Changes since v1:
- Add comment.
Changes since v2:
- Add fastpath for refcount = 1. (danvet)
Changes since v3:
- Rebased.
- Restore lastclose framebuffer removal too.
