staging: lustre: ldlm: remove code wireshark handling

Wireshark output moved to userland file "lustre_dlm_flags_wshark.c"
and only bits that can actually appear "on the wire" are emitted.
The user land "packet-lustre.c" code that references these bits
now gets emitted into that file. e.g. the "local_only" bit is
never put on the wire, so references to it in wireshark are gone.
