IB/srp: Always initialize use_fast_reg and use_fmr

Avoid that mapping fails due to use_fast_reg != 0 or use_fmr != 0
if both member variables should be zero (if never_register == 1 or
if neither FMR nor FR is supported). Remove an initialization that
became superfluous due to changing a kmalloc() into a kzalloc()
call.
