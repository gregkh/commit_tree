mmc: core: Add a facility to "pause" re-tuning

Re-tuning is not possible when switched to the RPMB
partition.  However re-tuning should not be needed
if re-tuning is done immediately before switching,
a small set of operations is done, and then we
immediately switch back to the main partition.

To ensure that re-tuning can't be done for a short
while, add a facility to "pause" re-tuning.

The existing facility to hold / release re-tuning
is used but it also flags re-tuning as needed to cause
re-tuning before the next command (which will be the
switch to RPMB).

We also need to "unpause" in the recovery path, which
is catered for by adding it to mmc_retune_disable().
