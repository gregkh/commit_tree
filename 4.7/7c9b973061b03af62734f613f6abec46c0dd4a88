irqchip/gic-v3: Configure all interrupts as non-secure Group-1

The GICv3 driver wrongly assumes that it runs on the non-secure
side of a secure-enabled system, while it could be on a system
with a single security state, or a GICv3 with GICD_CTLR.DS set.

Either way, it is important to configure this properly, or
interrupts will simply not be delivered on this HW.
