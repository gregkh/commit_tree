Kbuild: disable 'maybe-uninitialized' warning for CONFIG_PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES

CONFIG_PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES confuses gcc-5.x to the degree that it prints
incorrect warnings about a lot of variables that it thinks can be used
uninitialized, e.g.:

i2c/busses/i2c-diolan-u2c.c: In function 'diolan_usb_xfer':
i2c/busses/i2c-diolan-u2c.c:391:16: warning: 'byte' may be used uninitialized in this function
iio/gyro/itg3200_core.c: In function 'itg3200_probe':
iio/gyro/itg3200_core.c:213:6: warning: 'val' may be used uninitialized in this function
leds/leds-lp55xx-common.c: In function 'lp55xx_update_bits':
leds/leds-lp55xx-common.c:350:6: warning: 'tmp' may be used uninitialized in this function
misc/bmp085.c: In function 'show_pressure':
misc/bmp085.c:363:10: warning: 'pressure' may be used uninitialized in this function
power/ds2782_battery.c: In function 'ds2786_get_capacity':
power/ds2782_battery.c:214:17: warning: 'raw' may be used uninitialized in this function

These are all false positives that either rob someone's time when trying
to figure out whether they are real, or they get people to send wrong
patches to shut up the warnings.

Nobody normally wants to run a CONFIG_PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES kernel in
production, so disabling the whole class of warnings for this configuration
has no serious downsides either.
