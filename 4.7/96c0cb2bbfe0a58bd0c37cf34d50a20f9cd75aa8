iio: mma8452: add support for runtime power management

This adds support for runtime power management and, if configured, activates
automatic standby after 2 seconds of inactivity.

Inactivity means no read of acceleration values and no events triggered or
activated.

If CONFIG_PM is not set, this doesn't change anything for existing users.
