arm64: mm: move vmemmap region right below the linear region

This moves the vmemmap region right below PAGE_OFFSET, aka the start
of the linear region, and redefines its size to be a power of two.
Due to the placement of PAGE_OFFSET in the middle of the address space,
whose size is a power of two as well, this guarantees that virt to
page conversions and vice versa can be implemented efficiently, by
masking and shifting rather than ordinary arithmetic.
