tuntap: calculate rps hash only when needed

There's no need to calculate rps hash if it was not enabled. So this
patch export rps_needed and check it before trying to get rps
hash. Tests (using pktgen to inject packets to guest) shows this can
improve pps about 13% (when rps is disabled).

Before:
~1150000 pps
After:
~1300000 pps
