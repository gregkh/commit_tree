i40e: Disable link polling

Periodic link polling was added when the link events were found not to be
trustworthy.  This was the case early on, but was likely because the link
event mask was being used incorrectly.  As this has been fixed in recent
code, we can disable the link polling to lessen the AQ traffic.
