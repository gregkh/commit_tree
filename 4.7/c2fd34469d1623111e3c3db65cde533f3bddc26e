iwl4965: Fix a memory leak in error handling code of __il4965_up

When il4965_hw_nic_init in __il4965_up fails, the memory allocated by
iwl4965_sta_alloc_lq in iwl4965_alloc_bcast_station is not freed.

This patches adds il_dealloc_bcast_stations in the error handling code of
__il4965_up to fix this problem.

This patch has been tested in real device, and it actually fixes the bug.
