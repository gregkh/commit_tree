scsi: fix race between simultaneous decrements of ->host_failed

sas_ata_strategy_handler() adds the works of the ata error handler to
system_unbound_wq. This workqueue asynchronously runs work items, so the
ata error handler will be performed concurrently on different CPUs. In
this case, ->host_failed will be decreased simultaneously in
scsi_eh_finish_cmd() on different CPUs, and become abnormal.

It will lead to permanently inequality between ->host_failed and
->host_busy, and scsi error handler thread won't start running. IO
errors after that won't be handled.

Since all scmds must have been handled in the strategy handler, just
remove the decrement in scsi_eh_finish_cmd() and zero ->host_busy after
the strategy handler to fix this race.
