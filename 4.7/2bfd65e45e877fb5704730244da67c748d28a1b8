powerpc/mm/radix: Add radix callbacks for early init routines

This adds routines for early setup for radix. We use device tree
property "ibm,processor-radix-AP-encodings" to find supported page
sizes. If we don't find the above we consider 64K and 4K as supported
page sizes.

We do map vmemap using 2M page size if we can. The linear mapping is
done such that we use required page size for that range. For example
memory of 3.5G is mapped such that we use 1G mapping till 3G range and
use 2M mapping for the rest.
