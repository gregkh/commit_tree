KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: Add GICv3 SGI system register trap handler

In contrast to GICv2 SGIs in a GICv3 implementation are not triggered
by a MMIO write, but with a system register write. KVM knows about
that register already, we just need to implement the handler and wire
it up to the core KVM/ARM code.
