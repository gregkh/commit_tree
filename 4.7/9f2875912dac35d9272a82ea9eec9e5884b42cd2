arm64: mm: restrict virt_to_page() to the linear mapping

Now that the vmemmap region has been redefined to cover the linear region
rather than the entire physical address space, we no longer need to
perform a virtual-to-physical translation in the implementaion of
virt_to_page(). This restricts virt_to_page() translations to the linear
region, so redefine virt_addr_valid() as well.
