MIPS: Generate relocation table when CONFIG_RELOCATABLE

When CONFIG_RELOCATABLE is enabled (added in later patch) add
--emit-relocs to vmlinux LDFLAGS so that fully linked vmlinux contains
relocation information.

Run the previously added relocs tool to fill in the .data.relocs section
of vmlinux with a table of relocations. The relocs tool will also remove
(mark as 0 length) the relocation sections added to vmlinux.

When vmlinux is passed to the boot makefile for conversion into a boot
image the now empty relocation sections will be removed and the
populated relocation table will be included in the binary image.
