raxix-tree: introduce CONFIG_RADIX_TREE_MULTIORDER

I've been receiving increasingly concerned notes from 0day about how
much my recent changes have been bloating the radix tree.  Make it
happier by only including multiorder support if
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGES is set.

This is an independent Kconfig option, so other radix tree users can
also set it if they have a need.
