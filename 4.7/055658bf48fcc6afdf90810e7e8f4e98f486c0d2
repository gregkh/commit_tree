KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: Add PRIORITY registers handlers

The priority register handlers are shared between the v2 and v3
emulation, so their implementation goes into vgic-mmio.c, to be
easily referenced from the v3 emulation as well later.
There is a corner case when we change the priority of a pending
interrupt which we don't handle at the moment.
