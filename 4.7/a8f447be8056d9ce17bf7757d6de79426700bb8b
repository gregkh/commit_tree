mfd: Add resource managed APIs for mfd_add_devices

Add resource managed API devm_mfd_add_devices() for the mfd_add_devices().

This helps in reducing code in error path as it is not required
to call mfd_remove_devices() explicitly to remove all child-devices.
In some cases, it also helps not to implement .remove() callback
which get called during driver unbind.
