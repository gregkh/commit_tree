iommu/vt-d: Fix overflow of iommu->domains array

The valid range of 'did' in get_iommu_domain(*iommu, did)
is 0..cap_ndoms(iommu->cap), so don't exceed that
range in free_all_cpu_cached_iovas().

The user-visible impact of the out-of-bounds access is the machine
hanging on suspend-to-ram. It is, in fact, a kernel panic, but due
to already suspended devices, that's often not visible to the user.
