powerpc/mm: Move hugetlb and THP related pmd accessors to pgtable.h

Here we create pgtable-64/4k.h and move pmd accessors that are common
between hash and radix there. We can't do much sharing with 4K Linux
page size because 4K Linux page size with hash config doesn't support
THP. So for now it is empty. In later patches we will add functions that
does conditional hash/radix accessors there.
