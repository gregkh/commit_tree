clk: sunxi: Add TCON channel1 clock

The TCON is a controller generating the timings to output videos signals,
acting like both a CRTC and an encoder.

It has two channels depending on the output, each channel being driven by
its own clock (and own clock controller).

Add a driver for the channel 1 clock.
