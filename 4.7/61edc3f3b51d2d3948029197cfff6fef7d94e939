ubi: Don't bypass ->getattr()

Directly accessing inode fields bypasses ->getattr()
and can cause problems when the underlying filesystem
does not have the default ->getattr() implementation.

So instead of obtaining the backing inode via d_backing_inode()
use vfs_getattr() and obtain what we need from the kstat struct.
