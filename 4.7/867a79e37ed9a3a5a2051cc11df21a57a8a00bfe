i40e: Request PHY media event at reset time

Add the Media Not Available flag to the link event mask.  It seems
that event comes first if you have a DA cable pulled out, but there's no
follow-up event for Link Down; if you're not looking for MEDIA_NA you will
get no event, even though there's now no Link.
