staging: lustre: obd: MDT mount fails on MDS w/o MGS on it

If we specify multiple --mgsnode for a MDT, when we start MDS upon
it while MGS is no the other node, the MGC import connection will
always select the local nid (which is one of the candidate mgsnode)
since it think its the closest connection.

This patch treats further --mgsnode nids as failover nids, so that
multiple import connections are added for the MGC import.
