drm: rcar-du: Clarify vsp dependency

The VSP1 compositor code in DRM links against the respective V4L
driver, but the dependency is not expressed correctly in Kconfig,
which leads to a build error when the DRM driver is built-in
and the V4L driver is a module:

drivers/gpu/built-in.o: In function `rcar_du_vsp_plane_atomic_update':
rcar-du/rcar_du_vsp.c:183: undefined reference to `vsp1_du_atomic_update'

This patch avoids the problem by ensuring that the DRM VSP code can
only be enabled if the V4L driver is linked into the kernel, or
both are loadable modules.
