genirq: Allow the affinity of a percpu interrupt to be set/retrieved

In order to prepare the genirq layer for the concept of partitionned
percpu interrupts, let's allow an affinity to be associated with
such an interrupt. We introduce:

- irq_set_percpu_devid_partition: flag an interrupt as a percpu-devid
  interrupt, and associate it with an affinity
- irq_get_percpu_devid_partition: allow the affinity of that interrupt
  to be retrieved.

This will allow a driver to discover which CPUs the per-cpu interrupt
can actually fire on.
