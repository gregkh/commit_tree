powerpc/powernv/ioda1: Improve DMA32 segment track

In current implementation, the DMA32 segments required by one specific
PE isn't calculated with the information hold in the PE independently.
It conflicts with the PCI hotplug design: PE centralized, meaning the
PE's DMA32 segments should be calculated from the information hold in
the PE independently.

This introduces an array (@dma32_segmap) for every PHB to track the
DMA32 segmeng usage. Besides, this moves the logic calculating PE's
consumed DMA32 segments to pnv_pci_ioda1_setup_dma_pe() so that PE's
DMA32 segments are calculated/allocated from the information hold in
the PE (DMA32 weight). Also the logic is improved: we try to allocate
as much DMA32 segments as we can. It's acceptable that number of DMA32
segments less than the expected number are allocated.
