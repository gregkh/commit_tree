ARM: 8555/1: kallsyms: ignore ARM mode switching veneers

On ARM, the linker may emit veneers to deal with relative branch
instructions that appear too far away from their targets. Since the
second kallsyms pass results in an increase of the kernel size, it may
result in additional veneers to be emitted, potentially affecting the
output of kallsyms itself if these symbols are visible to it, and for
that reason, symbols whose names end in '_veneer' are ignored explicitly.

However, when building Thumb2 kernels, such veneers are named differently
if they also incur a mode switch, and since they are not filtered by
kallsyms, they may cause the build to fail. So filter symbols whose names
end in '_from_arm' or '_from_thumb' as well.
