btrfs: preallocate compression workspaces

Preallocate one workspace for each compression type so we can guarantee
forward progress in the worst case. A failure cannot be a hard error as
we might not use compression at all on the filesystem. If we can't
allocate the workspaces later when need them, it might actually
deadlock, but in such situation the system has effectively not enough
memory to operate properly.
