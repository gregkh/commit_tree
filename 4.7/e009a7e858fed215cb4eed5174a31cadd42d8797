cxl: Allow initialization on timebase sync failures

Failure to synchronize the PSL timebase currently prevents the
initialization of the cxl card, thus rendering the card useless. This
is too extreme for a feature which is rarely used, if at all. No
hardware AFUs or software is currently using PSL timebase.

This patch still tries to synchronize the PSL timebase when the card
is initialized, but ignores the error if it can't. Instead, it reports
a status via /sys.
