net: Don't forget pr_fmt on net_dbg_ratelimited for CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG

The implementation of net_dbg_ratelimited in the CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG
case was added with 2c94b5373 ("net: Implement net_dbg_ratelimited() for
CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG case"). The implementation strategy was to take the
usual definition of the dynamic_pr_debug macro, but alter it by adding a
call to "net_ratelimit()" in the if statement. This is, in fact, the
correct approach.

However, while doing this, the author of the commit forgot to surround
fmt by pr_fmt, resulting in unprefixed log messages appearing in the
console. So, this commit adds back the pr_fmt(fmt) invocation, making
net_dbg_ratelimited properly consistent across DEBUG, no DEBUG, and
DYNAMIC_DEBUG cases, and bringing parity with the behavior of
dynamic_pr_debug as well.
