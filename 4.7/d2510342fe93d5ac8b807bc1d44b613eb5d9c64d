usb: xhci: merge xhci_queue_bulk_tx and queue_bulk_sg_tx functions

In drivers/usb/host/xhci-ring.c there are two functions
(xhci_queue_bulk_tx and queue_bulk_sg_tx) that are very similar,
so a lot of code duplication.
This patch merges these functions into to one xhci_queue_bulk_tx.
Also counting the needed TRBs is merged and refactored.
