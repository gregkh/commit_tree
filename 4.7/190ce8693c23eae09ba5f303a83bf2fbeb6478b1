powerpc/tm: Avoid SLB faults in treclaim/trecheckpoint when RI=0

Currently we have 2 segments that are bolted for the kernel linear
mapping (ie 0xc000... addresses). This is 0 to 1TB and also the kernel
stacks. Anything accessed outside of these regions may need to be
faulted in. (In practice machines with TM always have 1T segments)

If a machine has < 2TB of memory we never fault on the kernel linear
mapping as these two segments cover all physical memory. If a machine
has > 2TB of memory, there may be structures outside of these two
segments that need to be faulted in. This faulting can occur when
running as a guest as the hypervisor may remove any SLB that's not
bolted.

When we treclaim and trecheckpoint we have a window where we need to
run with the userspace GPRs. This means that we no longer have a valid
stack pointer in r1. For this window we therefore clear MSR RI to
indicate that any exceptions taken at this point won't be able to be
handled. This means that we can't take segment misses in this RI=0
window.

In this RI=0 region, we currently access the thread_struct for the
process being context switched to or from. This thread_struct access
may cause a segment fault since it's not guaranteed to be covered by
the two bolted segment entries described above.

We've seen this with a crash when running as a guest with > 2TB of
memory on PowerVM:

This fixes this by copying the required data from the thread_struct to
the stack before we clear MSR RI. Then once we clear RI, we only access
the stack, guaranteeing there's no segment miss.

We also tighten the region over which we set RI=0 on the treclaim()
path. This may have a slight performance impact since we're adding an
mtmsr instruction.
