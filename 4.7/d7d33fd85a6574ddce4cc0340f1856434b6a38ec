drm/i915/bxt: Power down DDI PHYs separately during the per PHY uninit

The power-down step logically belongs to the individual PHY uninit
sequence so move it there. The only functional change is that we will
power down now PHY 1 separately before PHY 0 and preserve the other bits
in the register which are defined as reserved.
