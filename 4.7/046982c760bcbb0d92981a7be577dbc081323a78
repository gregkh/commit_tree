nios2: use correct void* return type for page_to_virt()

To align with other architectures, the expression produced by expanding
the macro page_to_virt() should be of type void*, since it returns a
virtual address. Fix that, and also fix up an instance where page_to_virt
was expected to return 'unsigned long', and drop another instance that was
entirely unused (page_to_bus)
