sched/fair: Generalize the load/util averages resolution definition

Integer metric needs fixed point arithmetic. In sched/fair, a few
metrics, e.g., weight, load, load_avg, util_avg, freq, and capacity,
may have different fixed point ranges, which makes their update and
usage error-prone.

In order to avoid the errors relating to the fixed point range, we
definie a basic fixed point range, and then formalize all metrics to
base on the basic range.

The basic range is 1024 or (1 << 10). Further, one can recursively
apply the basic range to have larger range.

Pointed out by Ben Segall, weight (visible to user, e.g., NICE-0 has
1024) and load (e.g., NICE_0_LOAD) have independent ranges, but they
must be well calibrated.
