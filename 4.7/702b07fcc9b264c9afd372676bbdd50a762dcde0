ACPI / SRAT: fix SRAT parsing order with both LAPIC and X2APIC present

SRAT maps APIC ID to proximity domains ids (PXM). Mapping from PXM to
NUMA node ids is based on order of entries in SRAT table.
SRAT table has just LAPIC entires or mix of LAPIC and X2APIC entries.
As long as there are only LAPIC entires, mapping from proximity domain
id to NUMA node id is as assumed by BIOS. However, once APIC entries are
mixed, X2APIC entries would be first mapped which causes unexpected NUMA
node mapping.

To fix that, change parsing to check each entry against both LAPIC and
X2APIC so mapping is in the SRAT/PXM order.

This is supplemental change to the fix made by commit d81056b5278
(Handle apic/x2apic entries in MADT in correct order) and using the
mechanism introduced by 9b3fedd (ACPI / tables: Add acpi_subtable_proc
to ACPI table parsers).
