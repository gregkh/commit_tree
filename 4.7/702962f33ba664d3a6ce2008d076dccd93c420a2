staging: wilc1000: replace sem_test_key_block with a completion

    Semaphore sem_test_key_block is used to signal completion of its
    host interface message. Since the thread locking this semaphore will
    have to wait, completions are the preferred mechanism and will offer
    a performance improvement.
