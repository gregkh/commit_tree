bpf: convert relevant helper args to ARG_PTR_TO_RAW_STACK

This patch converts all helpers that can use ARG_PTR_TO_RAW_STACK as argument
type. For tc programs this is bpf_skb_load_bytes(), bpf_skb_get_tunnel_key(),
bpf_skb_get_tunnel_opt(). For tracing, this optimizes bpf_get_current_comm()
and bpf_probe_read(). The check in bpf_skb_load_bytes() for MAX_BPF_STACK can
also be removed since the verifier already makes sure we stay within bounds
on stack buffers.
