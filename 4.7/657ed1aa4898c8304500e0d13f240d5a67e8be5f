Btrfs: fix for incorrect directory entries after fsync log replay

If we move a directory to a new parent and later log that parent and don't
explicitly log the old parent, when we replay the log we can end up with
entries for the moved directory in both the old and new parent directories.
Besides being ilegal to have directories with multiple hard links in linux,
it also resulted in the leaving the inode item with a link count of 1.
A similar issue also happens if we move a regular file - after the log tree
is replayed the file has a link in both the old and new parent directories,
when it should be only at the new directory.

Sample reproducer:

  $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdc
  $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt
  $ mkdir /mnt/x
  $ mkdir /mnt/y
  $ touch /mnt/x/foo
  $ mkdir /mnt/y/z
  $ sync
  $ ln /mnt/x/foo /mnt/x/bar
  $ mv /mnt/y/z /mnt/x/z
  < power fail >
  $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt
  $ ls -1Ri /mnt
  /mnt:
  257 x
  258 y

  /mnt/x:
  259 bar
  259 foo
  260 z

  /mnt/x/z:

  /mnt/y:
  260 z

  /mnt/y/z:

  $ umount /dev/sdc
  $ btrfs check /dev/sdc
  Checking filesystem on /dev/sdc
  UUID: a67e2c4a-a4b4-4fdc-b015-9d9af1e344be

        unresolved ref dir 258 index 2 namelen 1 name z filetype 2 errors 0
  (...)

Attempting to remove the directory becomes impossible:

  $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt
  $ rmdir /mnt/y/z
  $ ls -lh /mnt/y
  ls: cannot access /mnt/y/z: No such file or directory
  total 0
  d????????? ? ? ? ?            ? z
  $ rmdir /mnt/x/z
  rmdir: failed to remove ‘/mnt/x/z’: Stale file handle
  $ ls -lh /mnt/x
  ls: cannot access /mnt/x/z: Stale file handle
  total 0
  -rw-r--r-- 2 root root 0 Apr  6 18:06 bar
  -rw-r--r-- 2 root root 0 Apr  6 18:06 foo
  d????????? ? ?    ?    ?            ? z

So make sure that on rename we set the last_unlink_trans value for our
inode, even if it's a directory, to the value of the current transaction's
ID and that if the new parent directory is logged that we fallback to a
transaction commit.

A test case for fstests is being submitted as well.
