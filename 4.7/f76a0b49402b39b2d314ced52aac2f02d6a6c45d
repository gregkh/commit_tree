hisi_sas: for v2 hw only set ITCT qw2 for SAS device

This patch fixes the ITCT table setup as it should be configured
differently for SAS and SATA devices.  For SATA disks there is no need
to set qw2 (already zeroed).  Also, link parameters for Bus inactive
limit, max connection time limit, and reject to open limit timers
parameters are changed to match global config register,
MAX_CON_TIME_LIMIT_TIME, as recommended by hw team.
