ima: fix ima_inode_post_setattr

Changing file metadata (eg. uid, guid) could result in having to
re-appraise a file's integrity, but does not change the "new file"
status nor the security.ima xattr.  The IMA_PERMIT_DIRECTIO and
IMA_DIGSIG_REQUIRED flags are policy rule specific.  This patch
only resets these flags, not the IMA_NEW_FILE or IMA_DIGSIG flags.

With this patch, changing the file timestamp will not remove the
file signature on new files.
