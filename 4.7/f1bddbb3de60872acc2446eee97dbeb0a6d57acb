usb: gadget: Fix binding to UDC via configfs interface

By default user could store only valid UDC name in configfs UDC
attr by doing:

echo $UDC_NAME > UDC

Commit (855ed04 "usb: gadget: udc-core: independent registration of
gadgets and gadget drivers") broke this behavior and allowed to store
any arbitrary string in UDC file and udc core was waiting for such
controller to appear.

echo "any arbitrary string here" > UDC

This commit fix this by adding a flag which prevents configfs
gadget from being added to list of pending drivers if UDC with
given name has not been found.
