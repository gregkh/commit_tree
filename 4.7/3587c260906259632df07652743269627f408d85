pwm: rcar: Make use of pwm_is_enabled()

Commit 5c31252c4a86 ("pwm: Add the pwm_is_enabled() helper") introduced
a new function to test whether a PWM device is enabled or not without
manipulating PWM internal fields.

Hiding this is necessary if we want to smoothly move to the atomic PWM
config approach without impacting PWM drivers. Fix this driver to use
pwm_is_enabled() instead of directly accessing the ->flags field.
