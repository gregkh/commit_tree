[media] tw686x: Specify that the DMA is 32 bits

Set vb2_queue.gfp_flags to GFP_DMA32. Otherwise it will start to
create bounce buffers which is something you want to avoid since
those are in limited supply.

Without this patch, DMA scatter-gather may not work because
machines can ran out of buffers easily.
