irqdomain: Allow domain matching on irq_fwspec

When iterating over the irq domain list, we try to match a domain
either by calling a match() function or by comparing a number
of fields passed as parameters.

Both approaches are a bit restrictive:
- match() is DT specific and only takes a device node
- the fallback case only deals with the fwnode_handle

It would be useful if we had a per-domain function that would
actually perform the matching check on the whole of the
irq_fwspec structure. This would allow for a domain to triage
matching attempts that need to extend beyond the fwnode.

Let's introduce irq_find_matching_fwspec(), which takes a full
blown irq_fwspec structure, and call into a select() function
implemented by the irqdomain. irq_find_matching_fwnode() is
made a wrapper around irq_find_matching_fwspec in order to
preserve compatibility.
