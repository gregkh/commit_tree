tracing: Fix TRACING_MAP Kconfig

The config option for TRACING_MAP has "default n", which is not needed
because the default of configs is 'n'.

Also, since the TRACING_MAP has no config prompt, there's no reason to
include "If in doubt, say N" in the help text.

Fixed a typo in the comments of tracing_map.h.
