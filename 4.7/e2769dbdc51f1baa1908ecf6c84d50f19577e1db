mm, page_alloc: don't duplicate code in free_pcp_prepare

The new free_pcp_prepare() function shares a lot of code with
free_pages_prepare(), which makes this a maintenance risk when some
future patch modifies only one of them.  We should be able to achieve
the same effect (skipping free_pages_check() from !DEBUG_VM configs) by
adding a parameter to free_pages_prepare() and making it inline, so the
checks (and the order != 0 parts) are eliminated from the call from
free_pcp_prepare().

!DEBUG_VM: bloat-o-meter reports no difference, as my gcc was already
inlining free_pages_prepare() and the elimination seems to work as
expected

DEBUG_VM bloat-o-meter:

  add/remove: 0/1 grow/shrink: 2/0 up/down: 1035/-778 (257)
  function                                     old     new   delta
  __free_pages_ok                              297    1060    +763
  free_hot_cold_page                           480     752    +272
  free_pages_prepare                           778       -    -778

Here inlining didn't occur before, and added some code, but it's ok for
a debug option.
