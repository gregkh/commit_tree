Possible problem with e6afc8ac ("udp: remove headers from UDP packets before queueing")

Paul Moore tracked a regression caused by a recent commit, which
mistakenly assumed that sk_filter() could be avoided if socket
had no current BPF filter.

The intent was to avoid udp_lib_checksum_complete() overhead.

But sk_filter() also checks skb_pfmemalloc() and
security_sock_rcv_skb(), so better call it.
