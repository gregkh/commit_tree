staging: comedi: das1800: fix comments about the 'ao' board range

The waveform analog outputs on the 'ao' boards are not currently
supported. Modify the comment about the analog output range on
these boards so that the information is saved but fixes the
checkpatch.pl issues:
WARNING: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

Move the comment so it's grouped with the comedi_lrange info.
