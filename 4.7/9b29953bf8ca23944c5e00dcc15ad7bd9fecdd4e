IB/IPoIB: Disable bottom half when dealing with device address

Align locking usage when touching device address with rest
of the kernel. Lock the bottom half when doing so using
netif_addr_lock_bh.

This also solves the following case as reported by lockdep:
	CPU0                    CPU1
	----                    ----
lock(_xmit_INFINIBAND);
				local_irq_disable();
				lock(&(&mc->mca_lock)->rlock);
				lock(_xmit_INFINIBAND);
<Interrupt>
lock(&(&mc->mca_lock)->rlock);
