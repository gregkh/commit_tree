tipc: propagate peer node capabilities to socket layer

During neighbor discovery, nodes advertise their capabilities as a bit
map in a dedicated 16-bit field in the discovery message header. This
bit map has so far only be stored in the node structure on the peer
nodes, but we now see the need to keep a copy even in the socket
structure.

This commit adds this functionality.
