perf core: Allow setting up max frame stack depth via sysctl

The default remains 127, which is good for most cases, and not even hit
most of the time, but then for some cases, as reported by Brendan, 1024+
deep frames are appearing on the radar for things like groovy, ruby.

And in some workloads putting a _lower_ cap on this may make sense. One
that is per event still needs to be put in place tho.

The new file is:

  # cat /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_max_stack
  127

Chaging it:

  # echo 256 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_max_stack
  # cat /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_max_stack
  256

But as soon as there is some event using callchains we get:

  # echo 512 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_max_stack
  -bash: echo: write error: Device or resource busy
  #

Because we only allocate the callchain percpu data structures when there
is a user, which allows for changing the max easily, its just a matter
of having no callchain users at that point.
