drm/i915/userptr: Hold mmref whilst calling get-user-pages

Holding a reference to the containing task_struct is not sufficient to
prevent the mm_struct from being reaped under memory pressure. If this
happens whilst we are calling get_user_pages(), explosions erupt -
sometimes an immediate GPF, sometimes page flag corruption. To prevent
the target mm from being reaped as we are reading from it, acquire a
reference before we begin.
