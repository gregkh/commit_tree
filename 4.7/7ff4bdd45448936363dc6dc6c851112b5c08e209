mei: fix waiting for wr_ctrl for corner cases.

A control message reply may not be received if either a link reset has
occurred or disconnection is initiated by the FW.
In the both cases the client state will be set straight to DISCONNECTED
and the driver will wait till timeout.
Adding DISCONNECTED state in the waiting condition will release the
client from the stall.
