MAINTAINERS: Kdump maintainers update

I am proposing following updates to kdump maintainership.  I have got
busy in other things and not getting time to spend on kdump.

Remove Haren Myneni as he has not participated in kdump development for
a long time now.

Add the names of Dave and Baoquan as kdump maintainers as they have been
contributing to kdump for a long time now and they are in a much better
position to spend time on this than me.

Mark myself as a reviewer.
