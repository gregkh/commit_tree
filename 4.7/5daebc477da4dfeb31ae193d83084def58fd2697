MIPS: Fix siginfo.h to use strict posix types

Commit 85efde6f4e0d ("make exported headers use strict posix types")
changed the asm-generic siginfo.h to use the __kernel_* types, and
commit 3a471cbc081b ("remove __KERNEL_STRICT_NAMES") make the internal
types accessible only to the kernel, but the MIPS implementation hasn't
been updated to match.

Switch to proper types now so that the exported asm/siginfo.h won't
produce quite so many compiler errors when included alone by a user
program.
