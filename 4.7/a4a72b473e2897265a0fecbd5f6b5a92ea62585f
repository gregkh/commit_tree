ARM: dts: sh73a0: Correct interrupt type for ARM TWD

The ARM TWD interrupt is a private peripheral interrupt (PPI), and per
the ARM GIC documentation, whether the type for PPIs can be set is
IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.

For SH-Mobile AG5 devices the PPI type cannot be set, and so when we
attempt to set the type for the ARM TWD interrupt it fails.  This has
gone unnoticed because it fails silently, and because we cannot
re-configure the type it has had no impact. Nevertheless fix the type
for the TWD interrupt so that it matches the hardware configuration.

Based on patches by Jon Hunter for Tegra20/30 and OMAP4.
