net: ethernet: ti: cpsw: fix rx-usecs interrupt pacing consistency

The rx-usecs shouldn't be changed while interface down/up.
Currently, for instance, if it's set to 100us, after interface
down/up it's 500us. It's a hidden bug that can lead to lavish
interrupt pacing time increasing while "down/up" up to max value.

Steps to reproduce:
- set rx-usecs to be 100us
- down/up interface
- read new unexpected rx-usecs
