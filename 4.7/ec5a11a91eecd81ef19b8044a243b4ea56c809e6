serial: 8250: Validate dmaengine rx chan meets requirements

8250 dma support requires the dmaengine driver support error-free
pause/terminate and better-than-descriptor residue granularity. Query
slave caps to determine if necessary commands/properties are supported;
disable dma if not.

Note this means dmaengine driver must support slave caps reporting
as well.
