perf tests: Add test to check backward ring buffer

This test checks reading from backward ring buffer.

Test result:

  # ~/perf test 'ring buffer'
  45: Test backward reading from ring buffer                   : Ok

The test case is a while loop which calls prctl(PR_SET_NAME) multiple
times.  Each prctl should issue 2 events: one PERF_RECORD_SAMPLE, one
PERF_RECORD_COMM.

The first round creates a relative large ring buffer (256 pages). It can
afford all events. Read from it and check the count of each type of
events.

The second round creates a small ring buffer (1 page) and makes it
overwritable. Check the correctness of the buffer.
