MIPS: lib: Mark intrinsics notrace

On certain MIPS32 devices, the ftrace tracer "function_graph" uses
__lshrdi3() during the capturing of trace data. ftrace then attempts to
trace __lshrdi3() which leads to infinite recursion and a stack overflow.
Fix this by marking __lshrdi3() as notrace. Mark the other compiler
intrinsics as notrace in case the compiler decides to use them in the
ftrace path.
