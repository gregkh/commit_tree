IB/mlx5: Fix alternate path code

Userspace flag IBV_QP_ALT_PATH is supposed to set the alternate path
including fields alt_pkey_index and alt_timeout.
Added IB_QP_PKEY_INDEX and IB_QP_TIMEOUT to the attribute mask when
calling mlx5_set_path for the alternate path to force setting the
alt_pkey_index and alt_timeout values.
