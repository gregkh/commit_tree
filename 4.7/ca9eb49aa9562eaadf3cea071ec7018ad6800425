SIGNAL: Move generic copy_siginfo() to signal.h

The generic copy_siginfo() is currently defined in
asm-generic/siginfo.h, after including uapi/asm-generic/siginfo.h which
defines the generic struct siginfo. However this makes it awkward for an
architecture to use it if it has to define its own struct siginfo (e.g.
MIPS and potentially IA64), since it means that asm-generic/siginfo.h
can only be included after defining the arch-specific siginfo, which may
be problematic if the arch-specific definition needs definitions from
uapi/asm-generic/siginfo.h.

It is possible to work around this by first including
uapi/asm-generic/siginfo.h to get the constants before defining the
arch-specific siginfo, and include asm-generic/siginfo.h after. However
uapi headers can't be included by other uapi headers, so that first
include has to be in an ifdef __kernel__, with the non __kernel__ case
including the non-UAPI header instead.

Instead of that mess, move the generic copy_siginfo() definition into
linux/signal.h, which allows an arch-specific uapi/asm/siginfo.h to
include asm-generic/siginfo.h and define the arch-specific siginfo, and
for the generic copy_siginfo() to see that arch-specific definition.
