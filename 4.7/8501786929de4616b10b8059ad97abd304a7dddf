tcp/dccp: fix inet_reuseport_add_sock()

David Ahern reported panics in __inet_hash() caused by my recent commit.

The reason is inet_reuseport_add_sock() was still using
sk_nulls_for_each_rcu() instead of sk_for_each_rcu().
SO_REUSEPORT enabled listeners were causing an instant crash.

While chasing this bug, I found that I forgot to clear SOCK_RCU_FREE
flag, as it is inherited from the parent at clone time.
