regulator: act8865: Remove "too many regulators" error handler

The check would dereference pdata, which can be NULL in the non-DT
use case.

Nothing will break if pdata->num_regulators is larger than the number
of regulators that the driver defines: pdata->num_regulators is only
read in act8865_get_init_data() to iterate through pdata->regulators.

The error handler might have some value as a sanity check on the
platform data, but the platform data could be broken in many other
ways that are not checked for (unknown IDs, duplicate IDs), so I see
no reason to perform only this specific check.
