tracing: Move event_trigger_unlock_commit{_regs}() to local header

The functions event_trigger_unlock_commit() and
event_trigger_unlock_commit_regs() are no longer used outside the tracing
system. Move them out of the generic headers and into the local one.

Along with __event_trigger_test_discard() that is only used by them.
