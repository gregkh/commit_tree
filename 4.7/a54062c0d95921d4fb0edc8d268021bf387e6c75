rcutorture: Add boot-time adjustment of leaf fanout

Currently, the rcutorture scripts do not test boot-time adjustment of
leaf fanout (via the rcutree.rcu_fanout_leaf boot parameter), as was noted
during testing carried out by Iftekhar Ahmed of Oregon State University.
This commit therefore adjusts TREE04's CONFIG_RCU_FANOUT_LEAF from 4 to 3,
and also adds rcutree.rcu_fanout_leaf=4 to its boot parameters.  This
change forces RCU's boot-time geometry-change code to be exercised.
