mm, compaction: distinguish COMPACT_DEFERRED from COMPACT_SKIPPED

try_to_compact_pages() can currently return COMPACT_SKIPPED even when
the compaction is defered for some zone just because zone DMA is skipped
in 99% of cases due to watermark checks.  This makes COMPACT_DEFERRED
basically unusable for the page allocator as a feedback mechanism.

Make sure we distinguish those two states properly and switch their
ordering in the enum.  This would mean that the COMPACT_SKIPPED will be
returned only when all eligible zones are skipped.

As a result COMPACT_DEFERRED handling for THP in __alloc_pages_slowpath
will be more precise and we would bail out rather than reclaim.
