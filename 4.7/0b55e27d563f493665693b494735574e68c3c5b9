qed: IOV configure and FLR

While previous patches have already added the necessary logic to probe
VFs as well as enabling them in the HW, this patch adds the ability to
support VF FLR & SRIOV disable.

It then wraps both flows together into the first IOV callback to be
provided to the protocol driver - `configure'. This would later to be used
to enable and disable SRIOV in the adapter.
