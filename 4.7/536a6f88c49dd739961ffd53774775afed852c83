KVM: Create debugfs dir and stat files for each VM

This patch adds a kvm debugfs subdirectory for each VM, which is named
after its pid and file descriptor. The directories contain the same
kind of files that are already in the kvm debugfs directory, but the
data exported through them is now VM specific.

This makes the debugfs kvm data a convenient alternative to the
tracepoints which already have per VM data. The debugfs data is easy
to read and low overhead.
