drm/amdgpu: delay job free to when it's finished (v2)

for those jobs submitted through scheduler, do not
free it immediately after scheduled, instead free it
in global workqueue by its sched fence signaling
callback function.

v2:
call uf's bo_undef after job_run()
call job's sync free after job_run()
no static inline __amdgpu_job_free() anymore, just use
kfree(job) to replace it.
