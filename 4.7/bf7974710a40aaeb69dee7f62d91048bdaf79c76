devlink: add shared buffer configuration

Define userspace API and drivers API for configuration of shared
buffers. Four basic objects are defined:
shared buffer - attributes are size, number of pools and TCs
pool - chunk of sharedbuffer definition, it has some size and either
       static or dynamic threshold
port pool threshold - to set per-port threshold for each pool
port tc threshold bind - to bind port and TC to specified pool
                         with threshold.
