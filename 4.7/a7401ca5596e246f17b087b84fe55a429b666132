i2c: i801: Add runtime PM support with autosuspend

Allow runtime PM so that PM and PCI core can put the device into low-power
state when idle and resume it back when needed in those platforms that
support PM for i801 device.

Enable also autosuspend with 1 second delay in order to not needlessly
toggle power state on and off if there are multiple transactions during
short time.

Device is resumed at the beginning of bus access and marked idle ready
for autosuspend at the end of it.
