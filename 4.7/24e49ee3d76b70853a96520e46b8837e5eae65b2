sparc64: Reduce TLB flushes during hugepte changes

During hugepage map/unmap, TSB and TLB flushes are currently
issued at every PAGE_SIZE'd boundary which is unnecessary.
We now issue the flush at REAL_HPAGE_SIZE boundaries only.

Without this patch workloads which unmap a large hugepage
backed VMA region get CPU lockups due to excessive TLB
flush calls.
