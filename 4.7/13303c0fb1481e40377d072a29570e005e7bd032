iwlwifi: mvm: use helpers to get iwl_mvm_sta

Getting the mvm station out of station id requires dereferencing
the station id to get ieee80211_sta, then checking for pointer
validity and only then extract mvm station out.
Given that there are helpers to do it - use them instead of
duplicating the code whenever we need only mvm station.
