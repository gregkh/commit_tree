IB/hfi1: Fix QOS rule mappings

The QOS RSM rule mappings are off by one, referencing a kernel receive
context that does not exist.

Correctly start the QOS RSM map entries at FIRST_KERNEL_CONTEXT rather
than MIN_KERNEL_KCTXTS.  Remove the cruft that hid this.

Change the QP map table so all traffic not caught by QOS RSM goes to
the control context rather than the first QOS context.

Correct comments to match the actual code operation and intent.
