clk: bcm2835: pll_off should only update CM_PLL_ANARST

bcm2835_pll_off is currently assigning CM_PLL_ANARST to the control
register, which may lose the other bits that are currently set by the
clock dividers.

It also now locks during the read/modify/write cycle of both
registers.

audio domain clocks")
