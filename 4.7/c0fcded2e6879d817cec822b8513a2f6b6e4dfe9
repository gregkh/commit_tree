xen-netback: only deinitialized hash if it was initialized

A domain with a frontend that does not implement a control ring has been
seen to cause a crash during domain save. This was apparently because
the call to xenvif_deinit_hash() in xenvif_disconnect_ctrl() is made
regardless of whether a control ring was connected, and hence
xenvif_hash_init() was called.

This patch brings the call to xenvif_deinit_hash() in
xenvif_disconnect_ctrl() inside the if clause that checks whether the
control ring event channel was connected. This is sufficient to ensure
it is only called if xenvif_init_hash() was called previously.
