xfs: fix inode validity check in xfs_iflush_cluster

Some careless idiot(*) wrote crap code in commit 1a3e8f3 ("xfs:
convert inode cache lookups to use RCU locking") back in late 2010,
and so xfs_iflush_cluster checks the wrong inode for whether it is
still valid under RCU protection. Fix it to lock and check the
correct inode.
