x86/boot: Extract error reporting functions

Currently to use warn(), a caller would need to include misc.h. However,
this means they would get the (unavailable during compressed boot)
gcc built-in memcpy family of functions. But since string.c is defining
these memcpy functions for use by misc.c, we end up in a weird circular
dependency.

To break this loop, move the error reporting functions outside of misc.c
with their own header so that they can be independently included by
other sources. Since the screen-writing routines use memmove(), keep the
low-level *_putstr() functions in misc.c.
