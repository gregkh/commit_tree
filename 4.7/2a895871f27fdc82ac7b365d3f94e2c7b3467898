thermal: tegra: add thermtrip function

Add support for hardware critical thermal limits to the
SOC_THERM driver. It use the Linux thermal framework to
create critical trip temp, and set it to SOC_THERM hardware.
If these limits are breached, the chip will reset, and if
appropriately configured, will turn off the PMIC.

This support is critical for safe usage of the chip.
