KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: Implement virtual IRQ injection

Provide a vgic_queue_irq_unlock() function which decides whether a
given IRQ needs to be queued to a VCPU's ap_list.
This should be called whenever an IRQ becomes pending or enabled,
either as a result of userspace injection, from in-kernel emulated
devices like the architected timer or from MMIO accesses to the
distributor emulation.
Also provides the necessary functions to allow userland to inject an
IRQ to a guest.
Since this is the first code that starts using our locking mechanism, we
add some (hopefully) clear documentation of our locking strategy and
requirements along with this patch.
