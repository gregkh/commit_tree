tmpfs: mem_cgroup charge fault to vm_mm not current mm

Although shmem_fault() has been careful to count a major fault to vm_mm,
shmem_getpage_gfp() has been careless in charging a remote access fault
to current->mm owner's memcg instead of to vma->vm_mm owner's memcg:
that is inconsistent with all the mem_cgroup charging on remote access
faults in mm/memory.c.

Fix it by passing fault_mm along with fault_type to
shmem_get_page_gfp(); but in that case, now knowing the right mm, it's
better for it to handle the PGMAJFAULT updates itself.

And let's keep this clutter out of most callers' way: change the common
shmem_getpage() wrapper to hide fault_mm and fault_type as well as gfp.
