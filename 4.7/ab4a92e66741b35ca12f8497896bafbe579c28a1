MIPS: math-emu: Fix jalr emulation when rd == $0

When emulating a jalr instruction with rd == $0, the code in
isBranchInstr was incorrectly writing to GPR $0 which should actually
always remain zeroed. This would lead to any further instructions
emulated which use $0 operating on a bogus value until the task is next
context switched, at which point the value of $0 in the task context
would be restored to the correct zero by a store in SAVE_SOME. Fix this
by not writing to rd if it is $0.
