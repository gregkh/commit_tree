irqchip/gic-v2: Parse and export virtual GIC information

For now, the firmware tables are parsed 2 times: once in the GIC
drivers, the other timer when initializing the vGIC. It means code
duplication and make more tedious to add the support for another
firmware table (like ACPI).

Introduce a new structure and set of helpers to get/set the virtual GIC
information. Also fill up the structure for GICv2.
