regulator: Fix deadlock during regulator registration

Commit 5e3ca2b349b1 ("regulator: Try to resolve regulators supplies on
registration") added a call to regulator_resolve_supply() within
regulator_register() where the regulator_list_mutex is held. This causes
a deadlock to occur on the Tegra114 Dalmore board when the palmas PMIC
is registered because regulator_register_resolve_supply() calls
regulator_dev_lookup() which may try to acquire the regulator_list_mutex
again.

Fix this by releasing the mutex before calling
regulator_register_resolve_supply() and update the error exit path to
ensure the mutex is released on an error.
