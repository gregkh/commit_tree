Btrfs: do not create empty block group if we have allocated data

Now we force to create empty block group to keep data profile alive,
however, in the below example, we eventually get an empty block group
while we're trying to get more space for other types (metadata/system),

- Before,
block group "A": size=2G, used=1.2G
block group "B": size=2G, used=512M

- After "btrfs balance start -dusage=50 mount_point",
block group "A": size=2G, used=(1.2+0.5)G
block group "C": size=2G, used=0

Since there is no data in block group C, it won't be deleted
automatically and we have to get the unused 2G until the next mount.

Balance itself just moves data and doesn't remove data, so it's safe
to not create such a empty block group if we already have data
 allocated in other block groups.
