arm64: move early boot code to the .init segment

Apart from the arm64/linux and EFI header data structures, there is nothing
in the .head.text section that must reside at the beginning of the Image.
So let's move it to the .init section where it belongs.

Note that this involves some minor tweaking of the EFI header, primarily
because the address of 'stext' no longer coincides with the start of the
.text section. It also requires a couple of relocated symbol references
to be slightly rewritten or their definition moved to the linker script.
