drm/edid: Add drm_edid_get_monitor_name()

In order to include monitor name information in debugfs
output we needed to add a function that would extract the
monitor name from the EDID, and that function needed to
reside in the file  where the rest of the EDID helper
functions are implemented.

v2: Refactor to have drm_edid_get_monitor_name() and drm_edid_to_eld()
    use a common helper function to extract the monitor name from the
    edid. [Jani] + rebase.

v3: Minor changes suggested by Jani + rebase.

v4: Few more minor changes suggested by Jani + rebase.
