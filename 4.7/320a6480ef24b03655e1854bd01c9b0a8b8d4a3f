gpio: lpc32xx: disable broken to_irq support

The "to_irq" functionality is broken inside this driver since commit
76ba59f8366f ("genirq: Add irq_domain-aware core IRQ handler").

The addition of the new lpc32xx irqchip driver in 4.7, fixed the
lpc32xx platform interrupt issue.

When switching to the new lpc32xx irqchip driver, a warning appear
in the lpc32xx gpio driver: warning: "NR_IRQS" redefined.

To remove this warning (temporary solution), this patch
disables the broken "to_irq" mapping functionality support.
