mm/writeback: correct dirty page calculation for highmem

ZONE_MOVABLE could be treated as highmem so we need to consider it for
accurate calculation of dirty pages.  And, in following patches,
ZONE_CMA will be introduced and it can be treated as highmem, too.  So,
instead of manually adding stat of ZONE_MOVABLE, looping all zones and
check whether the zone is highmem or not and add stat of the zone which
can be treated as highmem.
