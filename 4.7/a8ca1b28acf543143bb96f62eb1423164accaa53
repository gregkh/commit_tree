dt-bindings: tegra: Rename some bindings for consistency

Device tree binding for NVIDIA Tegra have traditionally carried the
"nvidia," vendor prefix in the filename. A couple of odd ones don't, so
fix them up for consistency.

Also rename existing bindings to reflect the first compatible value that
they document. This wasn't done consistently either.
