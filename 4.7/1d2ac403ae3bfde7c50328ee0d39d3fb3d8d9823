drm: Protect dev->filelist with its own mutex

amdgpu gained dev->struct_mutex usage, and that's because it's walking
the dev->filelist list. Protect that list with it's own lock to take
one more step towards getting rid of struct_mutex usage in drivers
once and for all.

While doing the conversion I noticed that 2 debugfs files in i915
completely lacked appropriate locking. Fix that up too.

v2: don't forget to switch to drm_gem_object_unreference_unlocked.
