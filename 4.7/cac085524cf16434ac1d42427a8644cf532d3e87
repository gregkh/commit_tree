ath10k: move mgmt descriptor limit handle under mgmt_tx

Frames that are transmitted via MGMT_TX are using reserved descriptor
slots in firmware. This limitation is for the htt_mgmt_tx path itself,
not for mgmt frames per se. In 16 MBSSID scenario, these reserved slots
will be easy exhausted due to frequent probe responses. So for 10.4
based solutions, probe responses are limited by a threshold (24).

management tx path is separate for all except tlv based solutions. Since
tlv solutions (qca6174 & qca9377) do not support 16 AP interfaces, it is
safe to move management descriptor limitation check under mgmt_tx
function. Though CPU improvement is negligible, unlikely conditions or
never hit conditions in hot path can be avoided on data transmission.
