locking/ww_mutex: Report recursive ww_mutex locking early

Recursive locking for ww_mutexes was originally conceived as an
exception. However, it is heavily used by the DRM atomic modesetting
code. Currently, the recursive deadlock is checked after we have queued
up for a busy-spin and as we never release the lock, we spin until
kicked, whereupon the deadlock is discovered and reported.

A simple solution for the now common problem is to move the recursive
deadlock discovery to the first action when taking the ww_mutex.
