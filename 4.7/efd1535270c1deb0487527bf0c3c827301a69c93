xen-blkfront: don't call talk_to_blkback when already connected to blkback

Sometimes blkfront may twice receive blkback_changed() notification
(XenbusStateConnected) after migration, which will cause
talk_to_blkback() to be called twice too and confuse xen-blkback.

The flow is as follow:
   blkfront                                        blkback
blkfront_resume()
 > talk_to_blkback()
  > Set blkfront to XenbusStateInitialised
                                                front changed()
                                                 > Connect()
                                                  > Set blkback to XenbusStateConnected

blkback_changed()
 > Skip talk_to_blkback()
   because frontstate == XenbusStateInitialised
 > blkfront_connect()
  > Set blkfront to XenbusStateConnected

-----
And here we get another XenbusStateConnected notification leading
to:
-----
blkback_changed()
 > because now frontstate != XenbusStateInitialised
   talk_to_blkback() is also called again
  > blkfront state changed from
  XenbusStateConnected to XenbusStateInitialised
    (Which is not correct!)

						front_changed():
                                                 > Do nothing because blkback
                                                   already in XenbusStateConnected

Now blkback is in XenbusStateConnected but blkfront is still
in XenbusStateInitialised - leading to no disks.

Poking of the XenbusStateConnected state is allowed (to deal with
block disk change) and has to be dealt with. The most likely
cause of this bug are custom udev scripts hooking up the disks
and then validating the size.
