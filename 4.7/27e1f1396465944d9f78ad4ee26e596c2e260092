staging: wilc1000: changes logic when happened mq_send fail

This patch changes logic when happened mq_send fail.
The check as a result value that mq_send fail.
But, regardless of the result value then perform a semaphore up.
That is an occur that semaphore locking.
Add to 'else' routine and move to 'else' position a semaphore up.
