arm-ccn: Enable building as module

arm-ccn driver uses irq_set_affinity, which is not exported and
hence cannot be built as a module, eventhough we have all the
bits ready. This patch makes use of the exported helper
irq_set_affinity_hint() instead. Also, the __free_irq expects
the affinity_hint to be NULL when we free the irq. So set the
affinity_hint to NULL at clean up.

Now that we can build it as a module, update the Kconfig to
reflect the change.
