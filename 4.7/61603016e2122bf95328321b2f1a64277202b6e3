ARM: kexec: fix crashkernel= handling

When the kernel crashkernel parameter is specified with just a size, we
are supposed to allocate a region from RAM to store the crashkernel.
However, ARM merely reserves physical address zero with no checking that
there is even RAM there.

Fix this by lifting similar code from x86, importing it to ARM with the
ARM specific parameters added.  In the absence of any platform specific
information, we allocate the crashkernel region from the first 512MB of
physical memory.

Update the kdump documentation to reflect this change.
