btrfs: advertise which crc32c implementation is being used at module load

Since several architectures support hardware-accelerated crc32c
calculation, it would be nice to confirm that btrfs is actually using it.

We can see an elevated use count for the module, but it doesn't actually
show who the users are.  This patch simply prints the name of the driver
after successfully initializing the shash.
