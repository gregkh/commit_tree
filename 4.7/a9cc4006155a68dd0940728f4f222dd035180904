staging: lustre: lnet: Don't access NULL NI on failure path

In kiblnd_passive_connect(), if we are failing the connection
attempt because we cannot find a valid NI (we have a NULL NI),
we were coring after the "goto fail" because the failure
path was assuming non-NULL NI.

This patch ensures we don't dereference a NULL NI on that
failure path.
