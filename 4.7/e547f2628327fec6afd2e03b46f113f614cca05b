NFS: Fix another OPEN_DOWNGRADE bug

Olga Kornievskaia reports that the following test fails to trigger
an OPEN_DOWNGRADE on the wire, and only triggers the final CLOSE.

	fd0 = open(foo, RDRW)   -- should be open on the wire for "both"
	fd1 = open(foo, RDONLY)  -- should be open on the wire for "read"
	close(fd0) -- should trigger an open_downgrade
	read(fd1)
	close(fd1)

The issue is that we're missing a check for whether or not the current
state transitioned from an O_RDWR state as opposed to having transitioned
from a combination of O_RDONLY and O_WRONLY.
