rcu: Add exp_funnel_lock() fastpath

This commit speeds up the low-contention case, especially for systems
with large rcu_node trees, by attempting to directly acquire the
->exp_mutex.  This fastpath checks the leaves and root first in
order to avoid excessive memory contention on the mutex itself.
