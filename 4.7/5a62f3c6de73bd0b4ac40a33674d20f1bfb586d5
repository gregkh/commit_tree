mrf24j40: fix security-enabled processing on inbound frames

When receiving a security-enabled IEEE 802.15.4 frame, the MRF24J40
triggers a SECIF interrupt that needs to be handled for RX processing
to keep functioning properly.

This patch enables the SECIF interrupt and makes the MRF ignores all
hardware processing of security-enabled frames, that is handled by the
ieee802154 stack instead.
