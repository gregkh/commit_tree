locks: use file_inode()

(Another one for the f_path debacle.)

ltp fcntl33 testcase caused an Oops in selinux_file_send_sigiotask.

The reason is that generic_add_lease() used filp->f_path.dentry->inode
while all the others use file_inode().  This makes a difference for files
opened on overlayfs since the former will point to the overlay inode the
latter to the underlying inode.

So generic_add_lease() added the lease to the overlay inode and
generic_delete_lease() removed it from the underlying inode.  When the file
was released the lease remained on the overlay inode's lock list, resulting
in use after free.
