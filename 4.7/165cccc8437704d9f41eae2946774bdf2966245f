drm/hisilicon: Fix DRM_INFO printed issue

This patch fixed the bellow no DRM_INFO is printed issue:

if (!delay_count)
	DRM_INFO("phylock and phystopstateclklane is not ready.\n");

There will some printed issues with above info, under certain
circumstances:

If ((BIT(0) | BIT(2)) & val) is never true, break will not happen and
delay_count will be max u32 value (?), and no DRM_INFO is printed.

Also if ((BIT(0) | BIT(2)) & val) is true at the last possible
loop round, break happens, but now delay_count is already zero
( because of earlier delay_count-- ) and DRM_INFO is erroneously
printed.

Thanks to Juha Leppänen, he reports to me this issue.
