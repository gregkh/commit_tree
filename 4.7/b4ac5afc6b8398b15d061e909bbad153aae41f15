drm/i915: replace for_each_engine()

Having provided for_each_engine_id() for cases where the third (id)
argument is useful, we can now replace all the remaining instances with
a simpler version that takes only two parameters. In many cases, this
also allows the elimination of the local variable used in the iterator
(usually 'i').

v2:
    s/dev_priv/(dev_priv__)/ in body of for_each_engine_masked() [Chris Wilson]
