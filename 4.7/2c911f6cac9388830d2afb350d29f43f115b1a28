EDAC, altera: Remove useless casts

The altera EDAC driver refers to its per-device data
using a cast to '(void *)', which makes the pointer
non-const, though both the source and destination are
actually const.

Removing the annotation makes the reference (almost)
fit into a single line for improved readability, and
ensures that it is actually defined as const.
