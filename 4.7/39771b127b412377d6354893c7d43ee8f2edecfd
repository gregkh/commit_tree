sock: break up sock_cmsg_snd into __sock_cmsg_snd and loop

To process cmsg's of the SOL_SOCKET level in addition to
cmsgs of another level, protocols can call sock_cmsg_send().
This causes a double walk on the cmsghdr list, one for SOL_SOCKET
and one for the other level.

Extract the inner demultiplex logic from the loop that walks the list,
to allow having this called directly from a walker in the protocol
specific code.
