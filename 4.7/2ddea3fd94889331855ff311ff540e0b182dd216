drm/modes: reduce fb_lock to just protecting lists

This reduces the fb_lock to just protecting the num_fb/fb_list.

"Previously fb refcounting, and especially the weak reference
(kref_get_unless_zero) used in fb lookups have been protected by fb_lock.
But with the refactoring to share refcounting in the drm_mode_object base
class that switched to being protected by idr_mutex, which means fb_lock
critical sections can be reduced."
