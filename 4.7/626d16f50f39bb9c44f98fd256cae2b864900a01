sctp: export some apis or variables for sctp_diag and reuse some for proc

For some main variables in sctp.ko, we couldn't export it to other modules,
so we have to define some api to access them.

It will include sctp transport and endpoint's traversal.

There are some transport traversal functions for sctp_diag, we can also
use it for sctp_proc. cause they have the similar situation to traversal
transport.

v2->v3:
- rhashtable_walk_init need the parameter gfp, because of recent upstrem
  update
