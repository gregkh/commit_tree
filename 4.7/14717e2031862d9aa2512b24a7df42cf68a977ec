kvm: Conditionally register IRQ bypass consumer

If we don't support a mechanism for bypassing IRQs, don't register as
a consumer.  This eliminates meaningless dev_info()s when the connect
fails between producer and consumer, such as on AMD systems where
kvm_x86_ops->update_pi_irte is not implemented
