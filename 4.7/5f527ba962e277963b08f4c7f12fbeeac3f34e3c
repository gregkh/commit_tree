i40e: Limit the number of MAC and VLAN addresses that can be added for VFs

If the VF is privileged/trusted it can do as it may please including
but not limited to hogging resources and playing unfair.
But if the VF is not privileged/trusted it still can add some number
(8) of MAC and VLAN addresses.
Other restrictions with respect to Port VLAN and normal VLAN still apply
to not privileged/trusted VF.
