drm/i915: Fixing eDP detection on certain platforms

Since commit 30d9aa4265fe ("drm/i915: Read sink_count dpcd always"),
the status of a DP connector depends on its sink count value.
However, some eDP panels don't set that value appropriately,
causing them to be reported as disconnected.
Fix this by ignoring sink count for eDP.

v2: Rephrased commit message. (Ander)
    In case of eDP, returning status as connected if DPCD
    read succeeds to avoid any further operations.
