can: fix oops caused by wrong rtnl dellink usage

For 'real' hardware CAN devices the netlink interface is used to set CAN
specific communication parameters. Real CAN hardware can not be created nor
removed with the ip tool ...

This patch adds a private dellink function for the CAN device driver interface
that does just nothing.

It's a follow up to commit 993e6f2fd ("can: fix oops caused by wrong rtnl
newlink usage") but for dellink.
