crypto: omap-des - Integrate with the crypto engine framework

Since the crypto engine framework had been merged, thus this patch integrates
with the newly added crypto engine framework to make the crypto hardware
engine under utilized as each block needs to be processed before the crypto
hardware can start working on the next block.

The crypto engine framework can manage and process the requests automatically,
so remove the 'queue' and 'queue_task' things in omap des driver.
