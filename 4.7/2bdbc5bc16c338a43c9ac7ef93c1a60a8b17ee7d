Documentation/memcg: update kmem limit doc as codes behavior

The restriction of kmem setting is not there anymore because the
accounting is enabled by default even in the cgroup v1 - see
b313aeee2509 ("mm: memcontrol: enable kmem accounting for all
cgroups in the legacy hierarchy").

Update docs accordingly.
