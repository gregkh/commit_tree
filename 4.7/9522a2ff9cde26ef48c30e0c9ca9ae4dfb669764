cpufreq: intel_pstate: Enforce _PPC limits

Use ACPI _PPC notification to limit max P state driver will request.
ACPI _PPC change notification is sent by BIOS to limit max P state
in several cases:
- Reduce impact of platform thermal condition
- When Config TDP feature is used, a changed _PPC is sent to
follow TDP change
- Remote node managers in server want to control platform power
via baseboard management controller (BMC)

This change registers with ACPI processor performance lib so that
_PPC changes are notified to cpufreq core, which in turns will
result in call to .setpolicy() callback. Also the way _PSS
table identifies a turbo frequency is not compatible to max turbo
frequency in intel_pstate, so the very first entry in _PSS needs
to be adjusted.

This feature can be turned on by using kernel parameters:
intel_pstate=support_acpi_ppc
