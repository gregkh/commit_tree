sctp: sctp_diag should dump sctp socket type

Now we cannot distinguish that one sk is a udp or sctp style when
we use ss to dump sctp_info. it's necessary to dump it as well.

For sctp_diag, ss support is not officially available, thus there
are no official users of this yet, so we can add this field in the
middle of sctp_info without breaking user API.

v1->v2:
  - move 'sctpi_s_type' field to the end of struct sctp_info, so
    that it won't cause incompatibility with applications already
    built.
  - add __reserved3 in sctp_info to make sure sctp_info is 8-byte
    alignment.
