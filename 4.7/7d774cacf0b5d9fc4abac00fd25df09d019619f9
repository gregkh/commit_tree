drm/i915: Use new i915_gem_object_pin_map for LRC

We can use the new pin/lazy unpin API for simplicity
and more performance in the execlist submission paths.

v2:
  * Fix error handling and convert more users.
  * Compact some names for readability.

v3:
  * intel_lr_context_free was not unpinning.
  * Special case for GPU reset which otherwise unbalances
    the HWS object pages pin count by running the engine
    initialization only (not destructors).

v4:
  * Rebased on top of hws setup/init split.
