drivers: net: cpsw: fix port_mask parameters in ale calls

ALE APIs expect to receive port masks as input values for arguments
port_mask, untag, reg_mcast, unreg_mcast. But there are few places in
code where port masks are passed left-shifted by cpsw_priv->host_port,
like below:

 cpsw_ale_add_vlan(priv->ale, priv->data.default_vlan,
		  ALE_ALL_PORTS << priv->host_port,
		  ALE_ALL_PORTS << priv->host_port, 0, 0);

and cpsw is still working just because priv->host_port == 0
and has never ever been changed.

Hence, fix port_mask parameters in ALE APIs calls and drop
"<< priv->host_port" from all places where it's used to
shift valid port mask.
