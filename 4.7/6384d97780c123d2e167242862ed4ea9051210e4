powerpc/pci: Move pci_find_bus_by_node() around

This moves pci_find_bus_by_node() from arch/powerpc/platforms/
pseries/pci_dlpar.c to arch/powerpc/kernel/pci-hotplug.c so that
the function can be used by pSeries and PowerNV platform at the
same time. Also, below cleanup applied. No functional changes
introduced.

   * Remove variable "busdn" in find_bus_among_children()
   * Use PCI_DN() to convert device node to pci_dn
