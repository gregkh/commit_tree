staging/lustre/obdclass: limit lu_site hash table size

Allocating a big hash table using the formula for osd
does not really work for clients. We will create new
hash table for each mount on a single client which is
a lot of memory more than expected.

This patch limits the hash table up to 8M which has
524288 entries
