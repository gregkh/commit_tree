sock: enable timestamping using control messages

Currently, SOL_TIMESTAMPING can only be enabled using setsockopt.
This is very costly when users want to sample writes to gather
tx timestamps.

Add support for enabling SO_TIMESTAMPING via control messages by
using tsflags added in `struct sockcm_cookie` (added in the previous
patches in this series) to set the tx_flags of the last skb created in
a sendmsg. With this patch, the timestamp recording bits in tx_flags
of the skbuff is overridden if SO_TIMESTAMPING is passed in a cmsg.

Please note that this is only effective for overriding the recording
timestamps flags. Users should enable timestamp reporting (e.g.,
SOF_TIMESTAMPING_SOFTWARE | SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_ID) using
socket options and then should ask for SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_*
using control messages per sendmsg to sample timestamps for each
write.
