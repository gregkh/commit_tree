net/mlx5e: Expand WQE stride when CQE compression is enabled

Make the MPWQE/Striding RQ default configuration dynamic and not
statically set at compile time.  Now at driver load we set
stride size and num strides dynamically.

By default we use same values as before, but when CQE compression
is enabled, we set larger stride size to benefit from CQE
compression for larger packets.
