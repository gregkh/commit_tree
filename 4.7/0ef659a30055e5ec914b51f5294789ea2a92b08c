ARM: aspeed: adapt defconfigs for new CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME

Commit 94ea9c7a579f ("lib, switch CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME to int") changes
the type of CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME and adapts all existing defconfig files,
while we add two new defconfig files with d0bc3483da87 ("arm/configs:
Add Aspeed defconfig"), with the old type.

This changes the two new defconfig files to match the other ones.
As a result, we get harmless warnings for the arm-soc defconfig
branch by itself, but everything will work when 4.7-rc1 is out.
