drm/i915: Set invert bit for hpd based on VBT

This patch sets the invert bit for hpd detection for each port
based on VBT configuration. Since each AOB can be designed to
depend on invert bit or not, it is expected if an AOB requires
invert bit, the user will set respective bit in VBT.

v2: Separated VBT parsing from the rest of the logic. (Jani)

v3: Moved setting invert bit logic to bxt_hpd_irq_setup()
    and changed its logic to avoid looping twice. (Ville)

v4: Changed the logic to mask out the bits first and then
    set them to remove need of temporary variable. (Ville)

v5: Moved defines to existing set of defines for the register
    and added required breaks. (Ville)
