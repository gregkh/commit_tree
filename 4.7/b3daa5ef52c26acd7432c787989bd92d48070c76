drm: Add helper for DP++ adaptors

Add a helper which aids in the identification of DP dual mode
(aka. DP++) adaptors. There are several types of adaptors
specified: type 1 DVI, type 1 HDMI, type 2 DVI, type 2 HDMI

Type 1 adaptors have a max TMDS clock limit of 165MHz, type 2 adaptors
may go as high as 300MHz and they provide a register informing the
source device what the actual limit is. Supposedly also type 1 adaptors
may optionally implement this register. This TMDS clock limit is the
main reason why we need to identify these adaptors.

Type 1 adaptors provide access to their internal registers and the sink
DDC bus through I2C. Type 2 adaptors provide this access both via I2C
and I2C-over-AUX. A type 2 source device may choose to implement either
of these methods. If a source device implements the I2C-over-AUX
method, then the driver will obviously need specific support for such
adaptors since the port is driven like an HDMI port, but DDC
communication happes over the AUX channel.

This helper should be enough to identify the adaptor type (some
type 1 DVI adaptors may be a slight exception) and the maximum TMDS
clock limit. Another feature that may be available is control over
the TMDS output buffers on the adaptor, possibly allowing for some
power saving when the TMDS link is down.

Other user controllable features that may be available in the adaptors
are downstream i2c bus speed control when using i2c-over-aux, and
some control over the CEC pin. I chose not to provide any helper
functions for those since I have no use for them in i915 at this time.
The rest of the registers in the adaptor are mostly just information,
eg. IEEE OUI, hardware and firmware revision, etc.

v2: Pass adaptor type to helper functions to ease driver implementation
    Fix a bunch of typoes (Paulo)
    Add DRM_DP_DUAL_MODE_UNKNOWN for the case where we don't (yet) know
    the type (Paulo)
    Reject 0x00 and 0xff DP_DUAL_MODE_MAX_TMDS_CLOCK values (Paulo)
    Adjust drm_dp_dual_mode_detect() type2 vs. type1 detection to
    ease future LSPCON enabling
    Remove the unused DP_DUAL_MODE_LAST_RESERVED define
v3: Fix kernel doc function argument descriptions (Jani)
    s/NONE/UNKNOWN/ in drm_dp_dual_mode_detect() docs
    Add kernel doc for enum drm_dp_dual_mode_type
    Actually build the docs
    Fix more typoes
v4: Adjust code indentation of type2 adaptor detection (Shashank)
    Add debug messages for failurs cases (Shashank)
v5: EXPORT_SYMBOL(drm_dp_dual_mode_read) (Paulo)
