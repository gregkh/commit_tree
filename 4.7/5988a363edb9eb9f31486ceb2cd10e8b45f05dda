drivers/perf: arm_pmu: Avoid leaking pmu->irq_affinity on error

pmu->irq_affinity will not be freed if an error occurred within
arm_pmu_device_probe after of_pmu_irq_cfg has been called.

Note that in the case of_pmu_irq_cfg is returning an error,
pmu->irq_affinity will not be set, but it should be NULL as pmu was
kzalloc'd. Therefore the result kfree(NULL) is benign.
