PM / OPP: -ENOSYS is applicable only to syscalls

Some of the routines have used -ENOSYS for the cases where the
functionality isn't implemented in the kernel. But ENOSYS is supposed to
be used only for syscalls.

Replace that with -ENOTSUPP, which specifically means that the operation
isn't supported.

While at it, replace exiting -EINVAL errors for similar cases to
-ENOTSUPP.
