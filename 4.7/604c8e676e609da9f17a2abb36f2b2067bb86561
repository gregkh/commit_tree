arm64: enable CONFIG_SET_MODULE_RONX by default

The SET_MODULE_RONX protections are effectively the same as the
DEBUG_RODATA protections we enabled by default back in commit
57efac2f7108e325 ("arm64: enable CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA by default"). It
seems unusual to have one but not the other.

As evidenced by the help text, the rationale appears to be that
SET_MODULE_RONX interacts poorly with tracing and patching, but both of
these make use of the insn framework, which takes SET_MODULE_RONX into
account. Any remaining issues are bugs which should be fixed regardless
of the default state of the option.

This patch enables DEBUG_SET_MODULE_RONX by default, and replaces the
help text with a new wording derived from the DEBUG_RODATA help text,
which better describes the functionality. Previously, the DEBUG_RODATA
entry was inconsistently indented with spaces, which are replaced with
tabs as with the other Kconfig entries.

Additionally, the wording of recommended defaults is made consistent for
all options. These are placed in a new paragraph, unquoted, as a full
sentence (with a period/full stop) as this appears to be the most common
form per $(git grep 'in doubt').
