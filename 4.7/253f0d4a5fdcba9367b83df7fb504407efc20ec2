MIPS: Remove redundant asm/pgtable-bits.h inclusions

asm/pgtable-bits.h is included in 2 assembly files and thus has to
ifdef around C code, however nothing defined by the header is used
in either of the assembly files that include it.

Remove the redundant inclusions such that asm/pgtable-bits.h doesn't
need to #ifdef around C code, for cleanliness and in preparation for
later patches which will add more C.
