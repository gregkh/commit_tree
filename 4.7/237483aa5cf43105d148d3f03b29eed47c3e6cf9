coresight: stm: adding driver for CoreSight STM component

This driver adds support for the STM CoreSight IP block, allowing any
system compoment (HW or SW) to log and aggregate messages via a
single entity.

The CoreSight STM exposes an application defined number of channels
called stimulus port.  Configuration is done using entries in sysfs
and channels made available to userspace via configfs.
