kbuild: move -Wunused-const-variable to W=1 warning level

gcc-6 started warning by default about variables that are not
used anywhere and that are marked 'const', generating many
false positives in an allmodconfig build, e.g.:

arch/arm/mach-davinci/board-da830-evm.c:282:20: warning: 'da830_evm_emif25_pins' defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
arch/arm/plat-omap/dmtimer.c:958:34: warning: 'omap_timer_match' defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
drivers/bluetooth/hci_bcm.c:625:39: warning: 'acpi_bcm_default_gpios' defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
drivers/char/hw_random/omap-rng.c:92:18: warning: 'reg_map_omap4' defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
drivers/devfreq/exynos/exynos5_bus.c:381:32: warning: 'exynos5_busfreq_int_pm' defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
drivers/dma/mv_xor.c:1139:34: warning: 'mv_xor_dt_ids' defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]

This is similar to the existing -Wunused-but-set-variable warning
that was added in an earlier release and that we disable by default
now and only enable when W=1 is set, so it makes sense to do
the same here. Once we have eliminated the majority of the
warnings for both, we can put them back into the default list.

We probably want this in backport kernels as well, to allow building
them with gcc-6 without introducing extra warnings.
