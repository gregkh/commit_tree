libceph: ceph_osds, ceph_pg_to_up_acting_osds()

Knowning just acting set isn't enough, we need to be able to record up
set as well to detect interval changes.  This means returning (up[],
up_len, up_primary, acting[], acting_len, acting_primary) and passing
it around.  Introduce and switch to ceph_osds to help with that.

Rename ceph_calc_pg_acting() to ceph_pg_to_up_acting_osds() and return
both up and acting sets from it.
