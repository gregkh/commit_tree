radix tree test suite: multi-order iteration test

Add a unit test to verify that we can iterate over multi-order entries
properly via a radix_tree_for_each_slot() loop.

This was done with a single, somewhat complicated configuration that was
meant to test many of the various corner cases having to do with
multi-order entries:

- An iteration could begin at a sibling entry, and we need to return the
  canonical entry.
- We could have entries of various orders in the same slots[] array.
- We could have multi-order entries at a nonzero height, followed by
  indirect pointers to more radix tree nodes later in that same slots[]
  array.
