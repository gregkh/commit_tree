iio: st_sensors: verify interrupt event to status

This makes all ST sensor drivers check that they actually have
new data available for the requested channel(s) before claiming
an IRQ, by reading the status register (which is conveniently
the same for all ST sensors) and check that the channel has new
data before proceeding to read it and fill the buffer.

This way sensors can share an interrupt line: it can be flaged
as shared and then the sensor that did not fire will return
NO_IRQ, and the sensor that fired will handle the IRQ and
return IRQ_HANDLED.
