kbuild: create/adjust generated/autoksyms.h

Given the list of exported symbols needed by all modules, we can create
a header file containing preprocessor defines for each of those symbols.
Also, when some symbols are added and/or removed from the list, we can
update the time on the corresponding files used as build dependencies for
those symbols. And finally, if any symbol did change state, the
corresponding source files must be rebuilt.

The insertion or removal of an EXPORT_SYMBOL() entry within a module may
create or remove the need for another exported symbol.  This is why this
operation has to be repeated until the list of needed exported symbols
becomes stable. Only then the final kernel and modules link take place.
