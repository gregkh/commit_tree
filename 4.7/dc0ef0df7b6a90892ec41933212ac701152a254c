mm: make mmap_sem for write waits killable for mm syscalls

This is a follow up work for oom_reaper [1].  As the async OOM killing
depends on oom_sem for read we would really appreciate if a holder for
write didn't stood in the way.  This patchset is changing many of
down_write calls to be killable to help those cases when the writer is
blocked and waiting for readers to release the lock and so help
__oom_reap_task to process the oom victim.

Most of the patches are really trivial because the lock is help from a
shallow syscall paths where we can return EINTR trivially and allow the
current task to die (note that EINTR will never get to the userspace as
the task has fatal signal pending).  Others seem to be easy as well as
the callers are already handling fatal errors and bail and return to
userspace which should be sufficient to handle the failure gracefully.
I am not familiar with all those code paths so a deeper review is really
appreciated.

As this work is touching more areas which are not directly connected I
have tried to keep the CC list as small as possible and people who I
believed would be familiar are CCed only to the specific patches (all
should have received the cover though).

This patchset is based on linux-next and it depends on
down_write_killable for rw_semaphores which got merged into tip
locking/rwsem branch and it is merged into this next tree.  I guess it
would be easiest to route these patches via mmotm because of the
dependency on the tip tree but if respective maintainers prefer other
way I have no objections.

I haven't covered all the mmap_write(mm->mmap_sem) instances here

  $ git grep "down_write(.*\<mmap_sem\>)" next/master | wc -l
  98
  $ git grep "down_write(.*\<mmap_sem\>)" | wc -l
  62

I have tried to cover those which should be relatively easy to review in
this series because this alone should be a nice improvement.  Other
places can be changed on top.

This patch (of 18):

This is the first step in making mmap_sem write waiters killable.  It
focuses on the trivial ones which are taking the lock early after
entering the syscall and they are not changing state before.

Therefore it is very easy to change them to use down_write_killable and
immediately return with -EINTR.  This will allow the waiter to pass away
without blocking the mmap_sem which might be required to make a forward
progress.  E.g.  the oom reaper will need the lock for reading to
dismantle the OOM victim address space.

The only tricky function in this patch is vm_mmap_pgoff which has many
call sites via vm_mmap.  To reduce the risk keep vm_mmap with the
original non-killable semantic for now.

vm_munmap callers do not bother checking the return value so open code
it into the munmap syscall path for now for simplicity.
