pinctrl: Rename pinctrl_utils_dt_free_map to pinctrl_utils_free_map

Rename pinctrl_utils_dt_free_map to pinctrl_utils_free_map, since
it does not depend on device tree despite the current name. This
will enforce a consistent naming in pinctr-utils.c and will make
it clear it can be called from outside device tree (e.g. from
ACPI handling code).
