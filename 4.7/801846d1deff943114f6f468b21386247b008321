powerpc/powernv: Remove DMA32 PE list

PEs are put into PHB DMA32 list (phb->ioda.pe_dma_list) according
to their DMA32 weight. The PEs on the list are iterated to setup
their TCE32 tables at system booting time. The list is used for
once at boot time and no need to keep it.

This moves the logic calculating DMA32 weight of PHB and PE to
pnv_ioda_setup_dma() to drop PHB's DMA32 list. Also, every PE
traces the consumed DMA32 segment by @tce32_seg and @tce32_segcount
are useless and they're removed.
