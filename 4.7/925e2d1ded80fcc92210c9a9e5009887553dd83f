powerpc: Update of_remove_property() call sites to remove null checking

After obtaining a property from of_find_property() and before calling
of_remove_property() most code checks to ensure that the property
returned from of_find_property() is not null. The previous patch moved
this check to the start of the function of_remove_property() in order to
avoid the case where this check isn't done and a null value is passed.
This ensures the check is always conducted before taking locks and
attempting to remove the property. Thus it is no longer necessary to
perform a check for null values before invoking of_remove_property().

Update of_remove_property() call sites in order to remove redundant
checking for null property value as check is now performed within the
of_remove_property function().
