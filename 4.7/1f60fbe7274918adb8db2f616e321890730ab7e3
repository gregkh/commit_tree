ext4: allow readdir()'s of large empty directories to be interrupted

If a directory has a large number of empty blocks, iterating over all
of them can take a long time, leading to scheduler warnings and users
getting irritated when they can't kill a process in the middle of one
of these long-running readdir operations.  Fix this by adding checks to
ext4_readdir() and ext4_htree_fill_tree().

This was reverted earlier due to a typo in the original commit where I
experimented with using signal_pending() instead of
fatal_signal_pending().  The test was in the wrong place if we were
going to return signal_pending() since we would end up returning
duplicant entries.  See 9f2394c9be47 for a more detailed explanation.

Added fix as suggested by Linus to check for signal_pending() in
in the filldir() functions.
