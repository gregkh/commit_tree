arm64: Fix typo in the pmdp_huge_get_and_clear() definition

With hardware AF/DBM support, pmd modifications (transparent huge pages)
should be performed atomically using load/store exclusive. The initial
patches defined the get-and-clear function and __HAVE_ARCH_* macro
without the "huge" word, leaving the pmdp_huge_get_and_clear() to the
default, non-atomic implementation.
