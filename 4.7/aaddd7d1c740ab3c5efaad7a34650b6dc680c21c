sched/hotplug: Make activate() the last hotplug step

The scheduler can handle per cpu threads before the cpu is set to active and
it does not allow user space threads on the cpu before active is
set. Attaching to the scheduling domains is also not required before user
space threads can be handled.

Move the activation to the end of the hotplug state space. That also means
that deactivation is the first action when a cpu is shut down.
