atm: firestream: add more reserved strings

This bug was there when the driver was first added in back in year 2000.
It causes a Smatch warning:

    drivers/atm/firestream.c:849 process_incoming()
    error: buffer overflow 'res_strings' 60 <= 63

There are supposed to be 64 entries in this array and the missing
strings are clearly in the 30 40 range.  I added them as reserved 37 to
reserved 40.  It's possible that strings are really supposed to be added
in the middle instead of at the end, but this approach is safe, in that
it fixes the bug and doesn't break anything that wasn't already broken.
