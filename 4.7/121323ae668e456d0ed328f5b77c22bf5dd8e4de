drivers/perf: arm_pmu: Fix reference count of a device_node in of_pmu_irq_cfg

The only function called by of_pmu_irq_cfg that will increment the
reference count on dn is of_parse_phandle.

Each time we successfully parse a possible CPU from an
interrupt-affinity property, we increment the refcount of that CPU node
once via of_parse_handle. After validating the CPU is possible, we
decrement the refcount once. Subsequently, we decrement the refcount
again, either as part of an early break if we don't have a matching SPI,
or as part of the end of the loop body.

This will lead to decrementing twice the refcounnt.
Remove the second pairs of call to of_node_put as nobody is using dn
between the first and second call to of_node_put.
