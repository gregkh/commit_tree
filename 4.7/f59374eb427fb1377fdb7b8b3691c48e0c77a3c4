mac80211: synchronize driver rx queues before removing a station

Some devices, like iwlwifi, have RSS queues. This may cause a
situation where a disassociation is handled in control path and
results in station removal while there are prior RX frames
that were still not processed in other queues. When they will
be processed the station will be gone, and the frames will be
dropped.
Add a synchronization interface to avoid that. When driver returns
from the synchronization mac80211 may remove the station.
