MIPS: Don't BUG_ON when no IPI domain is found

Commit fbde2d7d8290 ("MIPS: Add generic SMP IPI support") introduced
code that BUG_ON's in the case of a kernel that supports IPI domains but
does not have one at runtime. This case is possible on Malta where for
IPIs we may use either the GIC (which has an IPI IRQ domain
implementation) or core-local software interrupts between VPEs (which do
not currently have an IPI IRQ domain implementation). We can not know
which will be used until runtime when we know whether a GIC is actually
present, and if we run on a system with multiple VPEs and no GIC then
the BUG_ON is hit.

Commit 19fb5818ed60 ("IPS: Fix broken malta qemu") worked around this
for the single-core single-VPE case typically seen using QEMU, but does
not catch the multi-VPE case. This patch removes the insufficient CPU
presence check that was added and works around the bug differently,
effectively reverting that commit.

A simple way to reproduce this bug is by using QEMU, which partially
implements the MT ASE but does not implement the GIC as of version 2.5.
Using "-cpu 34Kf -smp 2" will present a system with 2 VPEs in one core &
no GIC, hitting the BUG_ON.

Given that we're post-merge-window on the way to v4.6, avoid this by
just returning from mips_smp_ipi_init when no IPI IRQ domain is found.
Ideally at some point all IPI implementations would be converted to the
same IPI IRQ domain interface & we'd be able to restore the check.
