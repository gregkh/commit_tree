fnic: Cleanup the I/O pending with fw and has timed out and is used to issue LUN reset

In case of LUN reset, the device reset command is issued with one of the
I/Os that has timed out on that LUN. The change is to also return this
I/O with error status set to DID_RESET. In case when the reset is issued
using the sg_reset tool (from sg3_utils) it is a new command and new_sc
is set to 1.  Fnic driver version changed from 1.6.0.19 to 1.6.0.20
