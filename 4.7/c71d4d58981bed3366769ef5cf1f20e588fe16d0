drm/i915: Treat eDP as always connected, again

eDP should be treated as connected even if doesn't have an EDID. In that
case we'll use the timings from the VBT. That used to be the case until
commit f21a21983ef1 ("drm/i915: Splitting intel_dp_detect")
broke things by considering even eDP disconnected if we fail to get
an EDID for it.

Fix things up again by treating eDP as always connected.
