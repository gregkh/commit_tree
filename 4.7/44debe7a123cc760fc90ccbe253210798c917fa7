vgacon: dummy implementation for vgacon_text_force

This allows us to ditch a ton of ugly #ifdefs from a bunch of drm modeset
drivers.

v2: Make the dummy function actually return a sane value, spotted by
Ville.

v3: Because the patch is still in limbo there's no more drivers to
convert, noticed by Emil.

v4: Rebase once more, because hooray. I'll just go ahead an apply this
one later on to drm-misc.
