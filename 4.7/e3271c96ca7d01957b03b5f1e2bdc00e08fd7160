efi/arm*: Wire up 'struct screen_info' to efi-framebuffer platform device

This adds code to the ARM and arm64 EFI init routines to expose a platform
device of type 'efi-framebuffer' if 'struct screen_info' has been populated
appropriately from the GOP protocol by the stub. Since the framebuffer may
potentially be located in system RAM, make sure that the region is reserved
and marked MEMBLOCK_NOMAP.
