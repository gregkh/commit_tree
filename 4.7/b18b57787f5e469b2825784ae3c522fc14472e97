KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: Add data structure definitions

Add a new header file for the new and improved GIC implementation.
The big change is that we now have a struct vgic_irq per IRQ instead
of spreading all the information over various bitmaps.

We include this new header conditionally from within the old header
file for the time being to avoid touching all the users.
