bnxt: Add support for segmentation of tunnels with outer checksums

This patch assumes that the bnxt hardware will ignore existing IPv4/v6
header fields for length and checksum as well as the length and checksum
fields for outer UDP and GRE headers.

I have been told by Michael Chan that this is working.  Though this might
be somewhat redundant for IPv6 as they are forcing the checksum to be
computed for all IPv6 frames that are offloaded.  A follow-up patch may be
necessary in order to fix this as it is essentially mangling the outer IPv6
headers to add a checksum where none was requested.
