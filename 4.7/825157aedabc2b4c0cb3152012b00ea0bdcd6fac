staging: unisys: visorhba: main path needs to flow down the left margin

In del_scsipending_ent(), the error-path and main-path were switched, so
the error-path is handled like 'if (err) return;', and the main-path flows
down the left margin.  This also allowed us to remove the initialization of
"sent".
