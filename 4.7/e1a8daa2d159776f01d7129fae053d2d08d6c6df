drm/i915: Split out !RCS legacy context switching

Having the !RCS legacy context switch threaded through the RCS switching
code makes it much harder to follow and understand. In the next patch, I
want to fix a bug handling the incomplete switch, this is made much
simpler if we segregate the two paths now.
