ARM: davinci: da8xx: move usb code to new file

We will be adding more da8xx-specific code for phy and clocks, so it will
be better to have this in a separate file. This way we don't have a bunch
of #ifdefs for all of the da8xx stuff.

While at it, fix some checkpatch warnings coming from existing code.
