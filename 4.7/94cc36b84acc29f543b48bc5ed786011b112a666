MIPS: VDSO: Build with `-fno-strict-aliasing'

Avoid an aliasing issue causing a build error in VDSO:

with a CONFIG_DEBUG_OBJECTS_WORK configuration and GCC 5.2.0.  Include
`-fno-strict-aliasing' along with compiler options used, as required for
kernel code, fixing a problem present since the introduction of VDSO
with commit ebb5e78cc634 ("MIPS: Initial implementation of a VDSO").

Thanks to Tejun for diagnosing this properly!
