cpufreq: governor: New data type for management part of dbs_data

In addition to fields representing governor tunables, struct dbs_data
contains some fields needed for the management of objects of that
type.  As it turns out, that part of struct dbs_data may be shared
with (future) governors that won't use the common code used by
"ondemand" and "conservative", so move it to a separate struct type
and modify the code using struct dbs_data to follow.
