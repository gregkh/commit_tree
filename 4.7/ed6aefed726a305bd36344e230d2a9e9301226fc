Revert "ARCv2: spinlock/rwlock/atomics: Delayed retry of failed SCOND with exponential backoff"

This reverts commit e78fdfef84be13a5c2b8276e12203cdf24778596.

The issue was fixed in hardware in HS2.1C release and there are no known
external users of affected RTL so revert the whole delayed retry series !
