cpufreq: Call cpufreq_disable_fast_switch() in sugov_exit()

Due to differences in the cpufreq core's handling of runtime CPU
offline and nonboot CPUs disabling during system suspend-to-RAM,
fast frequency switching gets disabled after a suspend-to-RAM and
resume cycle on all of the nonboot CPUs.

To prevent that from happening, move the invocation of
cpufreq_disable_fast_switch() from cpufreq_exit_governor() to
sugov_exit(), as the schedutil governor is the only user of fast
frequency switching today anyway.

That simply prevents cpufreq_disable_fast_switch() from being called
without invoking the ->governor callback for the CPUFREQ_GOV_POLICY_EXIT
event (which happens during system suspend now).
