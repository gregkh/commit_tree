mm: use __SetPageSwapBacked and dont ClearPageSwapBacked

v3.16 commit 07a427884348 ("mm: shmem: avoid atomic operation during
shmem_getpage_gfp") rightly replaced one instance of SetPageSwapBacked
by __SetPageSwapBacked, pointing out that the newly allocated page is
not yet visible to other users (except speculative get_page_unless_zero-
ers, who may not update page flags before their further checks).

That was part of a series in which Mel was focused on tmpfs profiles:
but almost all SetPageSwapBacked uses can be so optimized, with the same
justification.

Remove ClearPageSwapBacked from __read_swap_cache_async() error path:
it's not an error to free a page with PG_swapbacked set.

Follow a convention of __SetPageLocked, __SetPageSwapBacked instead of
doing it differently in different places; but that's for tidiness - if
the ordering actually mattered, we should not be using the __variants.

There's probably scope for further __SetPageFlags in other places, but
SwapBacked is the one I'm interested in at the moment.
