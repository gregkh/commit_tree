isa: Dummy isa_register_driver should return error code

The inline isa_register_driver stub simply allows compilation on systems
with CONFIG_ISA disabled; the dummy isa_register_driver does not
register an isa_driver at all. The inline isa_register_driver should
return -ENODEV to indicate lack of support when attempting to register
an isa_driver on such a system with CONFIG_ISA disabled.
