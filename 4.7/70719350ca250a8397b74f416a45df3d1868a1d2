i2c: mv64xxx: use clk_{prepare_enable,disable_unprepare}

Instead of separately calling clk_prepare()/clk_enable(), use
clk_prepare_enable(), and instead of calling
clk_disable()/clk_unprepare(), use clk_disable_unprepare(). Those
handy shortcuts have been introduced specifically to simplify the
numerous call sites were both functions were called in sequence.
