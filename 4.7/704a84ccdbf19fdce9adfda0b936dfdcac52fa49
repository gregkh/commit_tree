[media] media: Support Intersil/Techwell TW686x-based video capture cards

This commit introduces the support for the Techwell TW686x video
capture IC. This hardware supports a few DMA modes, including
scatter-gather and frame (contiguous).

This commit makes little use of the DMA engine and instead has
a memcpy based implementation. DMA frame and scatter-gather modes
support may be added in the future.

Currently supported chips:
- TW6864 (4 video channels),
- TW6865 (4 video channels, not tested, second generation chip),
- TW6868 (8 video channels but only 4 first channels using
           built-in video decoder are supported, not tested),
- TW6869 (8 video channels, second generation chip).

  instead  of just "unsigned"]
