gpio: support native single-ended hardware drivers

Some GPIO controllers has a special hardware bit we can flip
to support open drain / source. This means that on these hardwares
we do not need to emulate OD/OS by setting the line to input
instead of actively driving it high/low. Add an optional vtable
callback to the driver set_single_ended() so that driver can
implement this in hardware if they have it.

We may need a pinctrl_gpio_set_config() call at some point to
propagate this down to a backing pin control device on systems
with split GPIO/pin control.
