dax: Define DAX lock bit for radix tree exceptional entry

We will use lowest available bit in the radix tree exceptional entry for
locking of the entry. Define it. Also clean up definitions of DAX entry
type bits in DAX exceptional entries to use defined constants instead of
hardcoding numbers and cleanup checking of these bits to not rely on how
other bits in the entry are set.
