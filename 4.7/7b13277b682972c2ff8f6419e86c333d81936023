microblaze: Add <asm/hash.h>

Microblaze is an FPGA soft core that can be configured various ways.

If it is configured without a multiplier, the standard __hash_32()
will require a call to __mulsi3, which is a slow software loop.

Instead, use a shift-and-add sequence for the constant multiply.
GCC knows how to do this, but it's not as clever as some.
