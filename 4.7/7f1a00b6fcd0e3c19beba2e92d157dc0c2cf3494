fix up initial thread stack pointer vs thread_info confusion

The INIT_TASK() initializer was similarly confused about the stack vs
thread_info allocation that the allocators had, and that were fixed in
commit b235beea9e99 ("Clarify naming of thread info/stack allocators").

The task ->stack pointer only incidentally ends up having the same value
as the thread_info, and in fact that will change.

So fix the initial task struct initializer to point to 'init_stack'
instead of 'init_thread_info', and make sure the ia64 definition for
that exists.

This actually makes the ia64 tsk->stack pointer be sensible for the
initial task, but not for any other task.  As mentioned in commit
b235beea9e99, that whole pointer isn't actually used on ia64, since
task_stack_page() there just points to the (single) allocation.

All the other architectures seem to have copied the 'init_stack'
definition, even if it tended to be generally unusued.
