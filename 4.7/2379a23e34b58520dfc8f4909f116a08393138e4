powerpc: get rid of superfluous __GFP_REPEAT

__GFP_REPEAT has a rather weak semantic but since it has been introduced
around 2.6.12 it has been ignored for low order allocations.

{pud,pmd}_alloc_one are allocating from {PGT,PUD}_CACHE initialized in
pgtable_cache_init which doesn't have larger than sizeof(void *) << 12
size and that fits into !costly allocation request size.

PGALLOC_GFP is used only in radix__pgd_alloc which uses either order-0
or order-4 requests.  The first one doesn't need the flag while the
second does.  Drop __GFP_REPEAT from PGALLOC_GFP and add it for the
order-4 one.

This means that this flag has never been actually useful here because it
has always been used only for PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY requests.
