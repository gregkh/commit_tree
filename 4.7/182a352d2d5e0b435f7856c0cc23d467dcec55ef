gre: Create common functions for transmit

Create common functions for both IPv4 and IPv6 GRE in transmit. These
are put into gre.h.

Common functions are for:
  - GRE checksum calculation. Move gre_checksum to gre.h.
  - Building a GRE header. Move GRE build_header and rename
    gre_build_header.
