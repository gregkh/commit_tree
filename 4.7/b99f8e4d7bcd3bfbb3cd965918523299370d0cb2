IB/srpt: convert to the generic RDMA READ/WRITE API

Replace the homegrown RDMA READ/WRITE code in srpt with the generic API.
The only real twist here is that we need to allocate one Linux scatterlist
per direct buffer in the SRP command, and chain them before handing them
off to the target core.

As a side-effect of the conversion the driver will also chain the SEND
of the SRP response to the RDMA WRITE WRs for a DATA OUT command, and
properly account for RDMA WRITE WRs instead of just for RDMA READ WRs
like the driver previously did.

We now allocate half of the SQ size to RDMA READ/WRITE contexts, assuming
by default one RDMA READ or WRITE operation per command.  If a command
has multiple operations it will eat into the budget but will still succeed,
possible after waiting for WQEs to be available.

Also ensure the QPs request the maximum allowed SGEs so that RDMA R/W API
works correctly.
