net/mlx5: E-Switch, Enable/disable ACL tables on demand

Enable ingress/egress ACL tables only when we need to configure ACL
rules.
Disable ingress/egress ACL tables once all ACL rules are removed.

All VF outgoing/incoming traffic need to go through the ingress/egress ACL
tables.
Adding/Removing these tables on demand will save unnecessary hops in the
flow steering when the ACL tables are empty.
