arm64: fix boot image dependencies to not generate invalid images

I fixed boot image dependencies for arch/arm in commit 3939f3345050
("ARM: 8418/1: add boot image dependencies to not generate invalid
images").

I see a similar problem for arch/arm64; "make -jN Image Image.gz"
would sometimes end up generating bad images where N > 1.

Fix the dependency in arch/arm64/Makefile to avoid the race
between "make Image" and "make Image.*".
