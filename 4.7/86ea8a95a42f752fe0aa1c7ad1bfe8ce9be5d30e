gpio: 104-idio-16: Utilize the ISA bus driver

The ACCES 104-IDIO-16 series communicates via the ISA bus. As such, it
is more appropriate to use the ISA bus driver over the platform driver
to control the ACCES 104-IDIO-16 GPIO driver.

This patch also adds support for multiple devices via the base and irq
module array parameters. Each element of the base array corresponds to a
discrete device; each element of the irq array corresponds to the
respective device addressed in the respective base array element.
