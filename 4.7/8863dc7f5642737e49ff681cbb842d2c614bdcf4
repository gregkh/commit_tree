drm/i915: Correctly refcount connectors in hw state readou

This was forgotten when adding the the refcounting to
drm_connector_state.

v2: Don't forget to unreference existing connectors. This isn't
relevant on driver load, but this code also runs on resume, and there
we already have an atomic state. Spotted by Chris Wilson.
