ALSA: hda - Apply AMP fix in hdmi_setup_audio_infoframe() generically

The need for reprogramming the AMP mute bit at each audio info frame
setup isn't always specific to Intel chips.  It's safer to set it
generically for all codecs with the amp bit, as this verb execution
itself isn't too much load.  This eliminates one usage of
is_haswell_plus() macro, after all.
