mmc: fix mmc mode selection for HS-DDR and higher

When IS_ERR_VALUE was removed from the mmc core code, it was replaced
with a simple not-zero check. This does not work, as the value checked
is the return value for mmc_select_bus_width, which returns the set
bit width on success. This made eMMC modes higher than HS-DDR unusable.

Fix this by checking for a positive return value instead.
