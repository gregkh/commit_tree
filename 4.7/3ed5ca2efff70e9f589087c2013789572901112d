perf trace: Do not process PERF_RECORD_LOST twice

We catch this record to provide a visual indication that events are
getting lost, then call the default method to allow extra logging shared
with the other tools to take place.

This extra logging was done twice because we were continuing to the
"default" clause where machine__process_event() will end up calling
machine__process_lost_event() again, fix it.
