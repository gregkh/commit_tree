gpiolib: Fix unaligned used of reference counters

gpiolib relies on the reference counters to clean up the gpio_device
structure.

Although the number of get/put is properly aligned on gpiolib.c
itself, it does not take into consideration how the referece counters
are affected by other external functions such as cdev_add and device_add.

Because of this, after the last call to put_device, the reference counter
has a value of +3, therefore never calling gpiodevice_release.

Due to the fact that some of the device  has already been cleaned on
gpiochip_remove, the library will end up OOPsing the kernel (e.g. a call
to of_gpiochip_find_and_xlate).
