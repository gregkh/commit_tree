selftests/powerpc: Test cp_abort during context switch

Test that performing a copy paste sequence in userspace on P9 does not
result in a leak of the copy into the paste of another process.

This is based on Anton Blanchard's context_switch benchmarking code. It
sets up two processes tied to the same CPU, one which copies and one
which pastes.

The paste should never succeed and the test fails if it does.

This is a test for commit, "8a64904 powerpc: Add support for userspace
P9 copy paste."
