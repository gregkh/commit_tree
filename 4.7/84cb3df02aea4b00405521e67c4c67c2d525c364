Bluetooth: hci_ldisc: Fix null pointer derefence in case of early data

HCI_UART_PROTO_SET flag is set before hci_uart_set_proto call. If we
receive data from tty layer during this procedure, proto pointer may
not be assigned yet, leading to null pointer dereference in rx method
hci_uart_tty_receive.

This patch fixes this issue by introducing HCI_UART_PROTO_READY flag in
order to avoid any proto operation before proto opening and assignment.
