iwl4965: Fix more memory leaks in __il4965_up()

In some of the non-success return paths, the memory allocated by
iwl4965_sta_alloc_lq() in iwl4965_alloc_bcast_station() is not freed.

In particular:
 - if the card isn't ready after il4965_prepare_card_hw()
 - if the card is hardware-rfkilled

In the hardware rfkilled path, the driver enables the rfkill
interrupt. When the card is unrfkilled and this interrupt is raised
we end up calling il4965_bg_restart() which calls __il4965_up() which
calls iwl4965_alloc_bcast_station() again.
