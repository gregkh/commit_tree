ARM: Explicitly apply PWM config extracted from pwm_args

Call pwm_apply_args() just after requesting the PWM device so that the
polarity and period are initialized according to the information
provided in pwm_args.

This is an intermediate state, and pwm_apply_args() should be dropped as
soon as the atomic PWM infrastructure is in place and the driver makes
use of it.
