efi: Add 'capsule' update support

The EFI capsule mechanism allows data blobs to be passed to the EFI
firmware. A common use case is performing firmware updates. This patch
just introduces the main infrastructure for interacting with the
firmware, and a driver that allows users to upload capsules will come
in a later patch.

Once a capsule has been passed to the firmware, the next reboot must
be performed using the ResetSystem() EFI runtime service, which may
involve overriding the reboot type specified by reboot=. This ensures
the reset value returned by QueryCapsuleCapabilities() is used to
reset the system, which is required for the capsule to be processed.
efi_capsule_pending() is provided for this purpose.

At the moment we only allow a single capsule blob to be sent to the
firmware despite the fact that UpdateCapsule() takes a 'CapsuleCount'
parameter. This simplifies the API and shouldn't result in any
downside since it is still possible to send multiple capsules by
repeatedly calling UpdateCapsule().
