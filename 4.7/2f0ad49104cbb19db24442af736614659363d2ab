ASoC: Change DAI link's be_id to a generic id

The generic ID can be used by topology:
- Toplogy can create FE links and set their ID, machine drivers will
  be notified and check this ID for machine-specific init.
- Toplogy can use the ID to find existing BE & CC links and further
  configure them.
