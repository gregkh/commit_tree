tty: vt, get rid of weird source code flow

Some code in vc_allocate is indented by 4 spaces. It is inside a
condition. Invert the condition and move the code to the first
indentation level (using \tab). And insert some empty lines to have
logical code blocks separated.

Then, instead of freeing in an 'if' false branch, use goto-error
label as fail path.

Maybe better to look at this patch with diff -w -b.
