iio:core: mounting matrix support

Expose a rotation matrix to indicate userspace the chip placement with
respect to the overall hardware system. This is needed to adjust
coordinates sampled from a sensor chip when its position deviates from the
main hardware system.

Final coordinates computation is delegated to userspace since:
* computation may involve floating point arithmetics ;
* it allows an application to combine adjustments with arbitrary
  transformations.

This 3 dimentional space rotation matrix is expressed as 3x3 array of
strings to support floating point numbers. It may be retrieved from a
"[<dir>_][<type>_]mount_matrix" sysfs attribute file. It is declared into a
device / driver specific DTS property or platform data.
