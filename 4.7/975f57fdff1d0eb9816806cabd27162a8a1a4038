crypto: vmx - Fix ABI detection

When calling ppc-xlate.pl, we pass it either linux-ppc64 or
linux-ppc64le. The script however was expecting linux64le, a result
of its OpenSSL origins. This means we aren't obeying the ppc64le
ABIv2 rules.

Fix this by checking for linux-ppc64le.

Fixes: 5ca55738201c ("crypto: vmx - comply with ABIs that specify vrsave as reserved.")
