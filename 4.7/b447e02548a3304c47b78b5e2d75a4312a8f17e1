Revert "scripts/gdb: add a Radix Tree Parser"

This reverts commit e127a73d41ac ("scripts/gdb: add a Radix Tree
Parser")

The python implementation of radix-tree was merged at the same time as
the radix-tree system was heavily reworked from commit e9256efcc8e3
("radix-tree: introduce radix_tree_empty") to 3bcadd6fa6c4 ("radix-tree:
free up the bottom bit of exceptional entries for reuse") and no longer
functions, but also prevents other gdb scripts from loading.

This functionality has not yet hit a release, so simply remove it for
now
