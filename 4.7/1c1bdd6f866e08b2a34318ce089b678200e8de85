mtd: nand: sunxi: implement ->read_oob()/->write_oob()

Allwinner's ECC engine is capable of protecting a few bytes of the OOB
area. Implement specific OOB functions to benefit from this capability.

Also, when in raw mode, the randomizer is disabled, which means you'll
only be able to retrieve randomized data, which is not really useful
for most applications.
