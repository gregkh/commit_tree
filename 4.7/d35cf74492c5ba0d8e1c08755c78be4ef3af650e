IB/hfi1: Serialize hrtimer function calls

hrtimer functions do not guarantee serialization, so we extend the
cca_timer_lock to cover the hrtimer_forward_now() in the hrtimer
callback handler and the hrtimer_start() in process_becn(). This
prevents races between these 2 functions to update the hrtimer state
leading to problems such as:
kernel BUG at kernel/hrtimer.c:1282!
encountered during validation of the CCA feature.
