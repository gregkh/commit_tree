ALSA: hda - Add the pin / port mapping on Intel ILK and VLV

Intel IronLake and ValleyView platforms have different HDMI widget pin
and digital port mapping from other newer ones.  The recent ones
(HSW+) have NID 0x05 to 0x07 for port B to port D, while these chips
have NID 0x04 to 0x06.

For adapting this mapping, pass the codec object instead of the bus
object to snd_hdac_sync_audio_rate() and snd_hdac_acomp_get_eld() so
that they can check the codec ID and calculate the mapping properly.

The changes in the HDMI codec driver side will follow in the later
patch.
