ARM: tegra: Add stdout-path for various boards

For Tegra boards, the device-tree alias serial0 is used for the console
and so add the stdout-path information so that the console no longer
needs to be passed via the kernel boot parameters.

This has been tested on boards, tegra20-trimslice, tegra30-beaver,
tegra114-dalmore and tegra124-jetson-tk1.
