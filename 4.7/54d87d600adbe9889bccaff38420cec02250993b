arc: get rid of superfluous __GFP_REPEAT

__GFP_REPEAT has a rather weak semantic but since it has been introduced
around 2.6.12 it has been ignored for low order allocations.

pte_alloc_one_kernel uses __get_order_pte but this is obviously always
zero because BITS_FOR_PTE is not larger than 9 yet the page size is
always larger than 4K.  This means that this flag has never been
actually useful here because it has always been used only for
PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY requests.
