PKCS#7: Make trust determination dependent on contents of trust keyring

Make the determination of the trustworthiness of a key dependent on whether
a key that can verify it is present in the supplied ring of trusted keys
rather than whether or not the verifying key has KEY_FLAG_TRUSTED set.

verify_pkcs7_signature() will return -ENOKEY if the PKCS#7 message trust
chain cannot be verified.
