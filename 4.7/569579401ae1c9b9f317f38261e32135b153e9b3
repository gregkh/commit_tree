ARC: opencode arc_request_percpu_irq

- The idea is to remove the API usage since it has a subltle
  design flaw - relies on being called on cpu0 first. This is true for
  some early per cpu irqs such as TIMER/IPI, but not for late probed
  per cpu peripherals such a perf. And it's usage in perf has already
  bitten us once: see c6317bc7c5ab
  ("ARCv2: perf: Ensure perf intr gets enabled on all cores") where we
  ended up open coding it anyways

- The seeming duplication will go away once we start using cpu notifier
  for timer setup
