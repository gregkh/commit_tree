pwm: Introduce the pwm_state concept

The PWM state, represented by its period, duty_cycle and polarity is
currently directly stored in the PWM device. Declare a pwm_state
structure embedding those field so that we can later use this struct
to atomically update all the PWM parameters at once.

All pwm_get_xxx() helpers are now implemented as wrappers around
pwm_get_state().
