[media] tvp5150: return I2C write operation failure to callers

The tvp5150_write() function calls i2c_smbus_write_byte_data() that
can fail but does not propagate the error to the caller. Instead it
just prints a debug, so callers can't know if the operation failed.

So change the function to return the error code to the caller so it
knows that the write failed and also print an error instead of just
printing a debug information.

While being there remove the inline keyword from tvp5150_write() to
make it consistent with tvp5150_read() and also because it's called
in a lot of places, so making inline is in fact counter productive
since it makes the kernel image size to be much bigger (~16 KiB).
