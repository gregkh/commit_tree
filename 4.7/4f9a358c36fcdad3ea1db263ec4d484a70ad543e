mm, compaction: update compaction_result ordering

compaction_result will be used as the primary feedback channel for
compaction users.  At the same time try_to_compact_pages (and
potentially others) assume a certain ordering where a more specific
feedback takes precendence.

This gets a bit awkward when we have conflicting feedback from different
zones.  E.g one returing COMPACT_COMPLETE meaning the full zone has been
scanned without any outcome while other returns with COMPACT_PARTIAL aka
made some progress.  The caller should get COMPACT_PARTIAL because that
means that the compaction still can make some progress.  The same
applies for COMPACT_PARTIAL vs COMPACT_PARTIAL_SKIPPED.

Reorder PARTIAL to be the largest one so the larger the value is the
more progress we have done.
