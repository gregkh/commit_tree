sched/core: Correct off by one bug in load migration calculation

The move of calc_load_migrate() from CPU_DEAD to CPU_DYING did not take into
account that the function is now called from a thread running on the outgoing
CPU. As a result a cpu unplug leakes a load of 1 into the global load
accounting mechanism.

Fix it by adjusting for the currently running thread which calls
calc_load_migrate().
