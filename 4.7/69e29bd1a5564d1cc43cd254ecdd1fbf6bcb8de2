arm64: tegra: Add stdout-path for various boards

For Tegra boards, the device-tree alias serial0 is used for the console
and so add the stdout-path information so that the console no longer
needs to be passed via the kernel boot parameters.

For tegra132-norrin the alias serial0 is not defined and so add this.

This has been tested on tegra132-norrin and tegra210-p2371-0000.
