ALSA: timer: Fix negative queue usage by racy accesses

The user timer tu->qused counter may go to a negative value when
multiple concurrent reads are performed since both the check and the
decrement of tu->qused are done in two individual locked contexts.
This results in bogus read outs, and the endless loop in the
user-space side.

The fix is to move the decrement of the tu->qused counter into the
same spinlock context as the zero-check of the counter.
