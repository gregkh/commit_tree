mac80211: allow not sending MIC up from driver for HW crypto

When HW crypto is used, there's no need for the CCMP/GCMP MIC to
be available to mac80211, and the hardware might have removed it
already after checking. The MIC is also useless to have when the
frame is already decrypted, so allow indicating that it's not
present.

Since we are running out of bits in mac80211_rx_flags, make
the flags field a u64.
