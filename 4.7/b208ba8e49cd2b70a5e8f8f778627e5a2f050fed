drm/i915: Rename __force_wake_get to __force_wake_auto

__force_wake_get() only acquires a temporary wakeref on forcewake that is
automatically released when a timer expires. When reading the code
again, I confused __intel_uncore_forcewake_get() for __force_wake_get()
and to my shame thought I found a bug in unbalanced wake_count handling.

I claim that if the function had been called __force_wake_auto() instead
I would not have embarrassed myself.
