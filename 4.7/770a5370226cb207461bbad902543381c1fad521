mm: thp: broken page count after commit aa88b68c3b1d

Christian Borntraeger reported a kernel panic after corrupt page counts,
and it turned out to be a regression introduced with commit aa88b68c3b1d
("thp: keep huge zero page pinned until tlb flush"), at least on s390.

put_huge_zero_page() was moved over from zap_huge_pmd() to
release_pages(), and it was replaced by tlb_remove_page().  However,
release_pages() might not always be triggered by (the arch-specific)
tlb_remove_page().

On s390 we call free_page_and_swap_cache() from tlb_remove_page(), and
not tlb_flush_mmu() -> free_pages_and_swap_cache() like the generic
version, because we don't use the MMU-gather logic.  Although both
functions have very similar names, they are doing very unsimilar things,
in particular free_page_xxx is just doing a put_page(), while
free_pages_xxx calls release_pages().

This of course results in very harmful put_page()s on the huge zero
page, on architectures where tlb_remove_page() is implemented in this
way.  It seems to affect only s390 and sh, but sh doesn't have THP
support, so the problem (currently) probably only exists on s390.

The following quick hack fixed the issue:
