ipv6: process socket-level control messages in IPv6

Process socket-level control messages by invoking
__sock_cmsg_send in ip6_datagram_send_ctl for control messages on
the SOL_SOCKET layer.

This makes sure whenever ip6_datagram_send_ctl is called for
udp and raw, we also process socket-level control messages.

This is a bit uglier than IPv4, since IPv6 does not have
something like ipcm_cookie. Perhaps we can later create
a control message cookie for IPv6?

Note that this commit interprets new control messages that
were ignored before. As such, this commit does not change
the behavior of IPv6 control messages.
