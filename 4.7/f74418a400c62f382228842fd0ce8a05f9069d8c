drm/vma_manage: Drop has_offset

It's racy, creating mmap offsets is a slowpath, so better to remove it
to avoid drivers doing broken things.

The only user is i915, and it's ok there because everything (well
almost) is protected by dev->struct_mutex in i915-gem.

While at it add a note in the create_mmap_offset kerneldoc that
drivers must release it again. And then I also noticed that
drm_gem_object_release entirely lacks kerneldoc.
