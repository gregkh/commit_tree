sctp: compress bit-wide flags to a bitfield on sctp_sock

It wastes space and gets worse as we add new flags, so convert bit-wide
flags to a bitfield.

Currently it already saves 4 bytes in sctp_sock, which are left as holes
in it for now. The whole struct needs packing, which should be done in
another patch.

Note that do_auto_asconf cannot be merged, as explained in the comment
before it.
