perf tools: Add time conversion event

Intel PT uses the time members from the perf_event_mmap_page to convert
between TSC and perf time.

Due to a lack of foresight when Intel PT was implemented, those time
members were recorded in the (implementation dependent) AUXTRACE_INFO
event, the structure of which is generally inaccessible outside of the
Intel PT decoder.  However now the conversion between TSC and perf time
is needed when processing a jitdump file when Intel PT has been used for
tracing.

So add a user event to record the time members.  'perf record' will
synthesize the event if the information is available.  And session
processing will put a copy of the event on the session so that tools
like 'perf inject' can easily access it.
