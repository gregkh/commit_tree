serial: doc: Re-add paragraph documenting uart_console_write()

Commit 834392a7d92677ff ("serial: doc: Un-document non-existing
uart_write_console()") removed a paragraph about a helper function that
seemed to never exist.

Peter Hurley pointed out that the function does exist, but is called
differently. Re-add the paragraph, with the function name corrected.
