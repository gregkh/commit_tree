gpio: flush direction status in gpiochip_lock_as_irq()

As irqchip and gpiochip functions are orthogonal, the IRQ
set-up or something else can have changed the direction of
the GPIO line from what the GPIO descriptor knows when we
get into gpiochip_lock_as_irq(). Make sure to re-read the
direction setting if we have the .get_direction() callback
enabled for the chip.

Else we get problems like this:

iio iio:device2: interrupts on the rising edge
gpio gpiochip2: (8012e080.gpio): gpiochip_lock_as_irq:
  tried to flag a GPIO set as output for IRQ
gpio gpiochip2: (8012e080.gpio): unable to lock HW IRQ 0 for IRQ
genirq: Failed to request resources for l3g4200d-trigger
  (irq 111) on irqchip nmk1-32-63
iio iio:device2: failed to request trigger IRQ.
st-gyro-i2c: probe of 2-0068 failed with error -22
