drm/i915: Don't pass plane+plane_state to intel_pin_and_fence_fb_obj()

intel_pin_and_fence_fb_obj() only needs the framebuffer, and the desird
rotation (to find the right GTT view for it), so no need to pass all
kinds of plane stuff.

The main motivation is to get rid of the uggy NULL plane_state handling
due to fbdev.

v2: Add a note why I really want this
