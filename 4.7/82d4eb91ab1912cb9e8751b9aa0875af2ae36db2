ASoC: sti: unip reader tdm mode

Here are the changes to enable reader tdm mode:
- When TDM_ENABLE is set to 1, the i2s format should be automatically
configured. Unfortunately this is not the case (HW bug). Then, we shall
force DATA_SIZE setting.
- Compute the transfer size for tdm mode: transfer size = user frame size
- Manage tdm slots configuration given in DT.
- Refine the hw param (channels & format) according to tdm slot config.
