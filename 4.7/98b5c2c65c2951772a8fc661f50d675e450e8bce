perf, bpf: allow bpf programs attach to tracepoints

introduce BPF_PROG_TYPE_TRACEPOINT program type and allow it to be attached
to the perf tracepoint handler, which will copy the arguments into
the per-cpu buffer and pass it to the bpf program as its first argument.
The layout of the fields can be discovered by doing
'cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched_switch/format'
prior to the compilation of the program with exception that first 8 bytes
are reserved and not accessible to the program. This area is used to store
the pointer to 'struct pt_regs' which some of the bpf helpers will use:
+---------+
| 8 bytes | hidden 'struct pt_regs *' (inaccessible to bpf program)
+---------+
| N bytes | static tracepoint fields defined in tracepoint/format (bpf readonly)
+---------+
| dynamic | __dynamic_array bytes of tracepoint (inaccessible to bpf yet)
+---------+

Not that all of the fields are already dumped to user space via perf ring buffer
and broken application access it directly without consulting tracepoint/format.
Same rule applies here: static tracepoint fields should only be accessed
in a format defined in tracepoint/format. The order of fields and
field sizes are not an ABI.
