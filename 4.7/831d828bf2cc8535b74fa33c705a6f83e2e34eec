net: hns: separate debug dsaf device from service dsaf device

There are two kinds of dsaf device in hns, one is for service ports,
contains crossbar in it, can work under different mode. Another is for
debug port, only can work under "single-port" mode. The current code only
declared a dsaf device for both service ports and debug ports. This patch
separate it to three platform devices.

Here is the diagram of all port in one platform device(old):
