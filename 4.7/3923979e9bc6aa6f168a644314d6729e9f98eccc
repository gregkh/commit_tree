IB/hfi1: Change hfi1_init loop to preserve error returns

If one iteration of the loop causes an error return and a later iteration
doesn't, the later iteration causes the earlier error condition to be
lost. This could result in driver probe succeeding when it should have
failed. Therefore save off the error return in the loop itself rather than
outside the loop.
