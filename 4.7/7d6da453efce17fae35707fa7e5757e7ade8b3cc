net: w5100: increase TX timeout period

This increases TX timeout period from one second to 5 seconds which is
the default value if the driver doesn't explicitly set
net_device->watchdog_timeo.

The one second timeout is too short for W5100 with SPI interface mode
which doesn't support burst READ/WRITE processing in the SPI transfer.
If the packet is transmitted while RX packets are being received at a
very high rate, the TX transmittion work in the workqueue is delayed
and the watchdog timer is expired.
