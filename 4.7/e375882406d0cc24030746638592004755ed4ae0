drm/udl: Use drm_fb_helper deferred_io support

Use the fbdev deferred io support in drm_fb_helper.
The (struct fb_ops *)->fb_{fillrect,copyarea,imageblit} functions will
now schedule a worker instead of being flushed directly like it was
previously (recorded when in atomic).

This patch has only been compile tested.
