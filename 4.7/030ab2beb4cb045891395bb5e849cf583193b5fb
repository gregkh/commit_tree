mfd: smsc-ece1099: Remove unnecessarily remove callback

SMSC MFD driver does not add any MFD child devices via
mfd_add_devices() and hence it is not required to call
mfd_remove_devices() to remove MFD child devices.

Remove the call of the API mfd_remove_devices() which will
result as remove of .remove callback for driver.
