mac80211: minstrel_ht: improve sample rate skip logic

There were a few issues that were slowing down the process of finding
the optimal rate, especially on devices with multi-rate retry
limitations:

When max_tp_rate[0] was slower than max_tp_rate[1], the code did not
sample max_tp_rate[1], which would often allow it to switch places with
max_tp_rate[0] (e.g. if only the first sampling attempts were bad, but the
rate is otherwise good).

Also, sample attempts of rates between max_tp_rate[0] and [1] were being
ignored in this case, because the code only checked if the rate was
slower than [1].

Fix this by checking against the fastest / second fastest max_tp_rate
instead of assuming a specific order between the two.

In my tests this patch significantly reduces the time until minstrel_ht
finds the optimal rate right after assoc
