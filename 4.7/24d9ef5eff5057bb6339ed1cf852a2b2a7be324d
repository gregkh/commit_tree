ath10k: cleanup copy engine receive next completion

The physical address necessary to unmap DMA ('bufferp') is stored
in ath10k_skb_cb as 'paddr'. For diag register read and write
operations, 'paddr' is stored in transfer context. ath10k doesn't rely
on the meta/transfer_id. So the unused output arguments {bufferp, nbytesp
and transfer_idp} are removed from CE recv_next completion.
