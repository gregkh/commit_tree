torture: Kill qemu, not parent process

The current hang-check machinery in the rcutorture scripts uses "$!" of
a parenthesized bash statement to capture the pid.  Unfortunately, this
captures not qemu's pid, but rather that of its parent that implements
the parenthesized statement.  This commit therefore adjusts things so as
to capture qemu's actual pid, which then allows the script to actually
kill qemu in event of a kernel hang.
