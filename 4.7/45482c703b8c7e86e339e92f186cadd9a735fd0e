cpufreq: governor: CPUFREQ_GOV_STOP never fails

None of the cpufreq governors currently in the tree will ever fail
an invocation of the ->governor() callback with the event argument
equal to CPUFREQ_GOV_STOP (unless invoked with incorrect arguments
which doesn't matter anyway) and it is rather difficult to imagine
a valid reason for such a failure.

Accordingly, rearrange the code in the core to make it clear that
this call never fails.
