lightnvm: refactor device ops->get_bb_tbl()

The device ops->get_bb_tbl() takes a callback, that allows the caller
to use its own callback function to update its data structures in the
returning function.

This makes it difficult to send parameters to the callback, and usually
is circumvented by small private structures, that both carry the callers
state and any flags needed to fulfill the update.

Refactor ops->get_bb_tbl() to fill a data buffer with the status of the
blocks returned, and let the user call the callback function manually.
That will provide the necessary flags and data structures and simplify
the logic around ops->get_bb_tbl().
