powerpc/eeh: rename EEH from "extended" to "enhanced" error handling

IBM online documentation for EEH uses "extended error handling" and
"enhanced error handling" to refer to the same thing, in different
places.  The only place mentioning it as "enhanced error handling" in the
kernel is the MAINTAINERS file, and it's "extended" in some documentation.

IBM originally defined EEH as "enhanced error handling", so standardise
all mentions of EEH to use that term.
