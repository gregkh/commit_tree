batman-adv: Use kref_get for batadv_gw_node_add

batadv_gw_node_add requires that the caller already has a valid reference
for orig_node. It is therefore not possible that it has an reference
counter of 0 and was still given to this function

The kref_get function instead WARNs (with debug information) when the
reference counter would still be 0. This makes a bug in batman-adv better
visible because kref_get_unless_zero would have ignored this problem.
