gpio: of: make it possible to name GPIO lines

Make it possible to name the producer side of a GPIO line using
a "gpio-line-names" property array, modeled on the
"clock-output-names" property from the clock bindings.

This naming is especially useful for:

- Debugging: lines are named after function, not just opaque
  offset numbers.

- Exploration: systems where some or all GPIO lines are available
  to end users, such as prototyping, one-off's "makerspace usecases"
  users are helped by the names of the GPIO lines when tinkering.
  This usecase has been surfacing recently.

The gpio-line-names attribute is completely optional.

Example output from lsgpio on a patched Snowball tree:

GPIO chip: gpiochip6, "8000e180.gpio", 32 GPIO lines

        line  1: "AP_GPIO161" "extkb3" [kernel]
