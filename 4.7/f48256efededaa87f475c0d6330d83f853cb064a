phy: make some bits preserved while setup forced mode

When tested the PHY SGMII Loopback:
1.set the LOOPBACK bit,
2.set the autoneg to AUTONEG_DISABLE, it calls the
genphy_setup_forced which will clear the bit.

The BMCR_LOOPBACK bit should be preserved.

As Florian pointed out that other bits should be preserved too.
So I make the BMCR_ISOLATE and BMCR_PDOWN as well.
