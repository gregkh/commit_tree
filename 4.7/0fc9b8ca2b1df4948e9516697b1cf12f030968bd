radix-tree test suite: add multi-order tag test

Add a generic test for multi-order tag verification, and call it using
several different configurations.

This test creates a multi-order radix tree using the given index and
order, and then sets, checks and clears tags using the indices covered
by the single multi-order radix tree entry.

With the various calls done by this test we verify root multi-order
entries without siblings, multi-order entries without siblings in a
radix tree node, as well as multi-order entries with siblings of various
sizes.
