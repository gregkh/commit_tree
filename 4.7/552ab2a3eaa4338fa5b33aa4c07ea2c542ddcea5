scripts/gdb: Perform path expansion to lx-symbol's arguments

Python doesn't do automatic expansion of paths.  In case one passes path
of the from ~/foo/bar the gdb scripts won't automatically expand that
and as a result the symbols files won't be loaded.

Fix this by explicitly expanding all paths which begin with "~"
