of: fix autoloading due to broken modalias with no 'compatible'

Because of an improper dereference, a stray 'C' character was output to
the modalias when no 'compatible' was specified. This is the case for
some old PowerMac drivers which only set the 'name' property. Fix it to
let them match again.
