iio: core: implement iio_device_{claim|release}_direct_mode()

It is often the case that the driver wants to be sure a device stays
in direct mode while it is executing a task or series of tasks.  To
accomplish this today, the driver performs this sequence: 1) take the
device state lock, 2) verify it is not in a buffered mode, 3) execute
some tasks, and 4) release that lock.

This patch introduces a pair of helper functions that simplify these
steps and make it more semantically expressive.

iio_device_claim_direct_mode()
        If the device is not in any buffered mode it is guaranteed
        to stay that way until iio_release_direct_mode() is called.

iio_device_release_direct_mode()
        Release the claim. Device is no longer guaranteed to stay
        in direct mode.
