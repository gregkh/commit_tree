mm, compaction: change COMPACT_ constants into enum

Compaction code is doing weird dances between COMPACT_FOO -> int ->
unsigned long

But there doesn't seem to be any reason for that.  All functions which
return/use one of those constants are not expecting any other value so it
really makes sense to define an enum for them and make it clear that no
other values are expected.

This is a pure cleanup and shouldn't introduce any functional changes.
