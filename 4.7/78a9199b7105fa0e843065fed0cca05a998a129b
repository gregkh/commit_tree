net/mlx5: E-Switch, Add promiscuous and allmulti FDB flowtable groups

Add promiscuous and allmulti steering groups in FDB table.
Besides the full match L2 steering rules group, we added
two more groups to catch the "miss" rules traffic:
* Allmulti group: One rule that forwards any mcast traffic coming from
either uplink or VFs/PF vports
* Promisc group: One rule that forwards all unmatched traffic coming
from uplink.

Needed for downstream privileged VF promisc and allmulti support.
