usb: dwc3: pci: make build-in device properties available

Setting the ACPI companion before calling dwc3_pci_quirks.
The ACPI companion will be set unconditionally as the
primary fwnode, overriding any previously set primary
fwnode. This will make sure that any build-in properties
added to the platform device will be added as the secondary
fwnode in cases where also ACPI companion exists.
