powerpc/eeh: Don't report error in eeh_pe_reset_and_recover()

The function eeh_pe_reset_and_recover() is used to recover EEH
error when the passthrough device are transferred to guest and
backwards, meaning the device's driver is vfio-pci or none.
When the driver is vfio-pci that provides error_detected() error
handler only, the handler simply stops the guest and it's not
expected behaviour. On the other hand, no error handlers will
be called if we don't have a bound driver.

This ignores the error handler in eeh_pe_reset_and_recover()
that reports the error to device driver to avoid the exceptional
behaviour.
