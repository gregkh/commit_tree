perf record: Generate tracking events for process forked by perf

With 'perf record --switch-output' without -a, record__synthesize() in
record__switch_output() won't generate tracking events because there's
no thread_map in evlist. Which causes newly created perf.data doesn't
contain map and comm information.

This patch creates a fake thread_map and directly call
perf_event__synthesize_thread_map() for those events.
