gpio: make sure gpiod_to_irq() returns negative on NULL desc

commit 54d77198fdfbc4f0fe11b4252c1d9c97d51a3264
("gpio: bail out silently on NULL descriptors")
doesn't work for gpiod_to_irq(): drivers assume that NULL
descriptors will give negative IRQ numbers in return.

It has been pointed out that returning 0 is NO_IRQ and that
drivers should be amended to treat this as an error, but that
is for the longer term: now let us repair the semantics.
