coresight: tmc: re-implementing tmc_read_prepare/unprepare() functions

In their current implementation the tmc_read_prepare/unprepare()
are a lump of if/else that is difficult to read.  This patch is
alleviating that by using a switch statement.  The latter also
allows for a better control on the error path.
