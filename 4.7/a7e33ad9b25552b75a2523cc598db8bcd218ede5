KVM: arm/arm64: arch_timer: Remove irq_phys_map

Now that the interface between the arch timer and the VGIC does not
require passing the irq_phys_map entry pointer anymore, let's remove
it from the virtual arch timer and use the virtual IRQ number instead
directly.
The remaining pointer returned by kvm_vgic_map_phys_irq() will be
removed in the following patch.
