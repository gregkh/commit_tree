[media] v4l2-device.h: add v4l2_device_mask_ variants

The v4l2_device_call_* defines filter subdevs based on the grp_id value.
But some drivers use a bitmask, so instead of filtering by grp_id == value,
you want to filter by grp_id & value.

Make variants of these defines to do this.

The 'has_op' define has been extended to have a grp_id argument as well, and
a mask variant has been added.

This extra argument required a change to go7007.
