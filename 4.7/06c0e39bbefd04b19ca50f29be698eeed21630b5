i40e: Add support for disabling all link and change bits needed for PHY interactions

Add flag to tell firmware to disable link on all ports.

This patch changes the bits set for telling firmware the PHY needs
to be modified by driver.  Without this patch, the setting will only
set that mode for the current port on the device.  Because the
MDIO interface is common for the copper device. The command needs to
set the mode for all ports.
