IB/core: Integrate IB address resolution module into core

IB address resolution is declared as a module (ib_addr.ko) which loads
itself before IB core module (ib_core.ko).

It causes to the scenario where IB netlink which is initialized by IB
core can't be used by ib_addr.ko.

In order to solve it, we are converting ib_addr.ko to be part of
IB core module.
