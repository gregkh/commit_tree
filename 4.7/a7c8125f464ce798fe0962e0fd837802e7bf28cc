drm/i915/bxt: Suspend power domains during suspend-to-idle

On SKL/KBL suspend-to-idle (aka freeze/s0ix) is performed with DMC
firmware assistance where the target display power state is DC6. On
Broxton on the other hand we don't use the firmware for this, but rely
instead on a manual DC9 flow. For this we have to uninitialize the
display following the BSpec display uninit sequence, just as during
S3/S4, so make sure we follow this sequence.
