perf/core: Fix pmu::filter_match for SW-led groups

The following commit:

  66eb579e66ec ("perf: allow for PMU-specific event filtering")

added the pmu::filter_match() callback. This was intended to
avoid HW constraints on events from resulting in extremely
pessimistic scheduling.

However, pmu::filter_match() is only called for the leader of each event
group. When the leader is a SW event, we do not filter the groups, and
may fail at pmu::add() time, and when this happens we'll give up on
scheduling any event groups later in the list until they are rotated
ahead of the failing group.

This can result in extremely sub-optimal event scheduling behaviour,
e.g. if running the following on a big.LITTLE platform:

$ taskset -c 0 ./perf stat \
 -e 'a57{context-switches,armv8_cortex_a57/config=0x11/}' \
 -e 'a53{context-switches,armv8_cortex_a53/config=0x11/}' \
 ls

     <not counted>      context-switches                                              (0.00%)
     <not counted>      armv8_cortex_a57/config=0x11/                                 (0.00%)
                24      context-switches                                              (37.36%)
          57589154      armv8_cortex_a53/config=0x11/                                 (37.36%)

Here the 'a53' event group was always eligible to be scheduled, but
the 'a57' group never eligible to be scheduled, as the task was always
affine to a Cortex-A53 CPU. The SW (group leader) event in the 'a57'
group was eligible, but the HW event failed at pmu::add() time,
resulting in ctx_flexible_sched_in giving up on scheduling further
groups with HW events.

One way of avoiding this is to check pmu::filter_match() on siblings
as well as the group leader. If any of these fail their
pmu::filter_match() call, we must skip the entire group before
attempting to add any events.
