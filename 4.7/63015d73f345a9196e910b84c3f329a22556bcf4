ARM: dts: am335x: Provide NAND ready pin

On these boards NAND ready pin status is avilable over
GPMC_WAIT0 pin.

For NAND we don't use GPMC wait pin monitoring but
get the NAND Ready/Busy# status using GPIOlib.
GPMC driver provides the WAIT0 pin status over GPIOlib.

Read speed increases from 7869 KiB/ to 8875 KiB/s
and write speed was unchanged at 5100 KiB/s.

Measured using mtd_speedtest.ko on am335x-evm.
