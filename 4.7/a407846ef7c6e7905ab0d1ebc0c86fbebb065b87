ceph: don't assume frag tree splits in mds reply are sorted

The algorithm that updates i_fragtree relies on that the frag tree
splits in mds reply are of the same order of i_fragtree. This is not
true because current MDS encodes frag tree splits in ascending order
of (unsigned)frag_t. But nodes in i_fragtree are sorted according to
ceph_frag_compare().

The fix is sort the frag tree splits first, then updates i_fragtree.
