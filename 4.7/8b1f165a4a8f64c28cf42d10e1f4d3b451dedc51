drm/i915: Actually retry with bit-banging after GMBUS timeout

After the GMBUS transfer times out, we set force_bit=1 and
return -EAGAIN expecting the i2c core to call the .master_xfer
hook again so that we will retry the same transfer via bit-banging.
This is in case the gmbus hardware is somehow faulty.

Unfortunately we left adapter->retries to 0, meaning the i2c core
didn't actually do the retry. Let's tell the core we want one retry
when we return -EAGAIN.

Note that i2c-algo-bit also uses this retry count for some internal
retries, so we'll end up increasing those a bit as well.
