firmware: fw_cfg register offsets on supported architectures only

Refrain from defining default fw_cfg register offsets on
unsupported architectures -- throw an error instead. If
QEMU were to add fw_cfg support on additional architectures,
we should add them to the FW_CFG_SYSFS depends statement in
drivers/firmware/Kconfig, and provide default values for
register offsets in drivers/firmware/qemu_fw_cfg.c at that
time.
