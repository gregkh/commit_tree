drm: Fix fb leaks and WARN spew in get/set_prop ioctls

Dave Airlie had at least the refcount leak fixed in a later patch (but
that patch does other things which need a bit more work). But we still
have the trouble that silly userspace could hit the WARN_ON in
drm_mode_object_find.

Fix this all up to make sure we don't leak objects, and don't spew
into demsg.

Fixes: d0f37cf62979 ("drm/mode: move framebuffer reference into object.")
Testcase: igt/kms_addfb_basic/invalid-*-prop*
