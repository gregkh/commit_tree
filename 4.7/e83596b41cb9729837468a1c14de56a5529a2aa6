pm80xx: Remove bogus address masking in pm8001_ioremap()

It is unclear what the original intent of the masking was, but it is
clearly incorrect to truncate a physical address before calling
ioremap().  On systems where there are valid physical address bits above
bit-31 (arm64 for example) the result is an eventual OOPs when
initializing the driver.

Remove the bogus code to fix it.
