net/mlx5_core: Flow counters infrastructure

If a counter has the aging flag set when created, it is added to a list
of counters that will be queried periodically from a workqueue.  query
result and last use timestamp are cached.
add/del counter must be very efficient since thousands of such
operations might be issued in a second.
There is only a single reference to counters without aging, therefore
no need for locks.
But, counters with aging enabled are stored in a list. In order to make
code as lockless as possible, all the list manipulation and access to
hardware is done from a single context - the periodic counters query
thread.

The hardware supports multiple counters per FTE, however currently we
are using one counter for each FTE.
