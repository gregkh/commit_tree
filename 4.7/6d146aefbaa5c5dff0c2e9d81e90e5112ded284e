drivers:hv: Record MMIO range in use by frame buffer

Later in the boot sequence, we need to figure out which memory
ranges can be given out to various paravirtual drivers.  The
hyperv_fb driver should, ideally, be placed right on top of
the frame buffer, without some other device getting plopped on
top of this range in the meantime.  Recording this now allows
that to be guaranteed.
