sparc64: Take ctx_alloc_lock properly in hugetlb_setup().

On cheetahplus chips we take the ctx_alloc_lock in order to
modify the TLB lookup parameters for the indexed TLBs, which
are stored in the context register.

This is called with interrupts disabled, however ctx_alloc_lock
is an IRQ safe lock, therefore we must take acquire/release it
properly with spin_{lock,unlock}_irq().
