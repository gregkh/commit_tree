MIPS: dts: qca: ar9132_tl_wr1043nd_v1.dts: drop unused alias node

The TP-LINK TL-WR1043ND board has only one serial port,
so replacing the default of 0 with 0 does nothing useful.

Moreover, the correct name for aliases node is "aliases" not "alias".

An overview of the "aliases" node usage can be found
on the device tree usage page at devicetree.org [1].

Also please see chapter 3.3 ("Aliases node") of the ePAPR 1.1 [2].
