KVM: s390: Populate mask of non-hypervisor managed facility bits

When a guest is initializing, KVM provides facility bits that can be
successfully used by the guest. It's done by applying
kvm_s390_fac_list_mask mask on host facility bits stored by the STFLE
instruction. Facility bits can be one of two kinds: it's either a
hypervisor managed bit or non-hypervisor managed.

The hardware provides information which bits need special handling.
Let's automatically passthrough to guests new facility bits, that
don't require hypervisor support.
