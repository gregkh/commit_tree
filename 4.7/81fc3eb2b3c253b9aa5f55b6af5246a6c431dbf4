mtd: augment the "arm,versatile-flash" bindings

The bindings for the "arm,versatile-flash" device was merged in
commit 3ba7222ac992d24d09ccd0b55940b54849eef752
"arm/versatile: Add device tree support" but was never used
for anything.

Versatile flash chips are actually just standard CFI chips,
but they have one or two bits in a system controller to control
VPP and write protection. Let's use this compatible string in
conjunction with "cfi-flash" to indicate that we have a
normal CFI flash with some extra Versatile-specific protection.
