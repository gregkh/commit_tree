drm/i915: Don't read out port_clock on CHV when DPLL is disabled

Check whether the DPLL is even enabled before readoing out the dividers
and trying to derive port_clock on CHV. We already did this on VLV.

Also remove the comment "MIPI" comment from the VLV code since we call
this function whenever the pipe is enabled.
