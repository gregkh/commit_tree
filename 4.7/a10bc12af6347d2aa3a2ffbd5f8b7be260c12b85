scsi_debug: replace tasklet with work queue

When a negative value was placed in the delay parameter, a tasklet was
scheduled. Change the tasklet to a work queue. Previously a delay of -1
scheduled a high priority tasklet; since there are no high priority work
queues, treat -1 like other negative values in delay and schedule a work
item.
