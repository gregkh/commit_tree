ACPI / sysfs: fix error code in get_status()

The problem with ornamental, do-nothing gotos is that they lead to
"forgot to set the error code" bugs.  We should be returning -EINVAL
here but we don't.  It leads to an uninitalized variable in
counter_show():

    drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:603 counter_show()
    error: uninitialized symbol 'status'.
