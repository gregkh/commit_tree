MIPS: Retrieve ASID masks using function accepting struct cpuinfo_mips

In preparation for supporting variable ASID masks, retrieve ASID masks
using functions in asm/cpu-info.h which accept struct cpuinfo_mips. This
will allow those functions to determine the ASID mask based upon the CPU
in a later patch. This also allows for the r3k & r8k cases to be handled
in Kconfig, which is arguably cleaner than the previous #ifdefs.
