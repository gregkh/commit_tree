regulator: twl: Fix a typo in twl4030_send_pb_msg

Commit <2330b05c095bdeaaf1261c54cd2d4b9127496996> ("regulator: twl: Make
sure we have access to powerbus before trying to write to it")
has implemented the needed logic to correctly access powerbus through i2c,
however it brought a typo when powerbus configuration is restored, which
results in writing to a wrong register. Fix that by providing the correct
register value.
