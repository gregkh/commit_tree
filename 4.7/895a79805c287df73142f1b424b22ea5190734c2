cxl: Handle num_of_processes larger than can fit in the SPA

num_of_process is a 16 bit field, theoretically allowing an AFU to
support 16K processes, however the scheduled process area currently has
a maximum size of 1MB, which limits the maximum number of processes to
7704.

Some AFUs may not necessarily care what the limit is and just want to be
able to use the maximum by setting the field to 16K. To allow these to
work, detect this situation and use the maximum size for the SPA.

Downgrade the WARN_ON to a dev_warn.
