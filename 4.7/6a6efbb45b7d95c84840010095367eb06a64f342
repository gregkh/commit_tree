arm64: Verify CPU errata work arounds on hotplugged CPU

CPU Errata work arounds are detected and applied to the
kernel code at boot time and the data is then freed up.
If a new hotplugged CPU requires a work around which
was not applied at boot time, there is nothing we can
do but simply fail the booting.
