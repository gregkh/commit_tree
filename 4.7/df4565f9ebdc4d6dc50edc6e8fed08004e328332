kernel/kcov: unproxify debugfs file's fops

Since commit 49d200deaa68 ("debugfs: prevent access to removed files'
private data"), a debugfs file's file_operations methods get proxied
through lifetime aware wrappers.

However, only a certain subset of the file_operations members is supported
by debugfs and ->mmap isn't among them -- it appears to be NULL from the
VFS layer's perspective.

This behaviour breaks the /sys/kernel/debug/kcov file introduced
concurrently with commit 5c9a8750a640 ("kernel: add kcov code coverage").

Since that file never gets removed, there is no file removal race and thus,
a lifetime checking proxy isn't needed.

Avoid the proxying for /sys/kernel/debug/kcov by creating it via
debugfs_create_file_unsafe() rather than debugfs_create_file().
