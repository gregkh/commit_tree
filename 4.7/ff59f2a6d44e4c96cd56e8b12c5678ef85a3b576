staging: speakup: fix type mismatch warnings

Compiling speakup driver with sparse produces following warning:

drivers/staging/speakup/serialio.c:22:9: warning: incorrect type in
initializer (different base types)
drivers/staging/speakup/serialio.c:22:9:    expected unsigned int
[unsigned] flags
drivers/staging/speakup/serialio.c:22:9:    got restricted upf_t

This patch fixes it.
