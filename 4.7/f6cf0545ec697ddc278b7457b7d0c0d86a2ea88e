PM / Hibernate: Call flush_icache_range() on pages restored in-place

Some architectures require code written to memory as if it were data to be
'cleaned' from any data caches before the processor can fetch them as new
instructions.

During resume from hibernate, the snapshot code copies some pages directly,
meaning these architectures do not get a chance to perform their cache
maintenance. Modify the read and decompress code to call
flush_icache_range() on all pages that are restored, so that the restored
in-place pages are guaranteed to be executable on these architectures.
