EDAC, sb_edac: Fix Knights Landing

In commit 2c1ea4c700af ("EDAC, sb_edac: Use cpu family/model in driver
detection") I broke Knights Landing because I failed to notice that it
called a wrapper macro "sbridge_get_all_devices_knl" instead of
"sbridge_get_all_devices" like all the other types.

Now that we include the processor type in the pci_id_table structure we
can skip the wrappers and just have the sbridge_get_all_devices() check
the type to decide whether to allow duplicate devices and controllers to
have registers spread across buses.
