powerpc/mm/slice: Remove slice_mm_new_context()

The usage in mm mmu_context_nohash.c is bogus, because we set the
context.id value to MMU_NO_CONTEXT 4 lines previously in the same
function, meaning slice_mm_new_context() will always be true.

The book3s 64 usage was removed in the previous commit. So remove it as
unused.
