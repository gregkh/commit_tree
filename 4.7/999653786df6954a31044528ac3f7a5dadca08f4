nfsd: check permissions when setting ACLs

Use set_posix_acl, which includes proper permission checks, instead of
calling ->set_acl directly.  Without this anyone may be able to grant
themselves permissions to a file by setting the ACL.

Lock the inode to make the new checks atomic with respect to set_acl.
(Also, nfsd was the only caller of set_acl not locking the inode, so I
suspect this may fix other races.)

This also simplifies the code, and ensures our ACLs are checked by
posix_acl_valid.

The permission checks and the inode locking were lost with commit
4ac7249e, which changed nfsd to use the set_acl inode operation directly
instead of going through xattr handlers.
