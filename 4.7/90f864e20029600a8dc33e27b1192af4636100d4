lib/mpi: mpi_read_buffer(): replace open coded endian conversion

Currently, the endian conversion from CPU order to BE is open coded in
mpi_read_buffer().

Replace this by the centrally provided cpu_to_be*() macros.
Copy from the temporary storage on stack to the destination buffer
by means of memcpy().
