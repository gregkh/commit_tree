radix-tree: fix radix_tree_create for sibling entries

If the radix tree user attempted to insert a colliding entry with an
existing multiorder entry, then radix_tree_create() could encounter a
sibling entry when walking down the tree to look for a slot.  Use
radix_tree_descend() to fix the problem, and add a test-case to make
sure the problem doesn't come back in future.
