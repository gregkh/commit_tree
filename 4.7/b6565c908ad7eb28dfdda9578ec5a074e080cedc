perf trace: Use the fd->name beautifier as default for "fd" args

Noticed when the 'setsockopt' 'fd' arg wasn't being formatted via
the SCA_FD beautifier, so just remove the setting of "fd" args to
SCA_FD and do it when reading the syscall info, like we do for
args of type "pid_t", i.e. "fd" as the name should be enough as
the decision to use the SFA_FD beautifier. For odd cases we can
just do it explicitely.
