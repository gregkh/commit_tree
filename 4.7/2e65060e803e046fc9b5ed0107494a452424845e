dmaengine: dw: revisit data_width property

There several changes are done here:

- Convert the property to be in bytes

  Besides that this is a common practice for such property, the use of a value
  in bytes much more convenient than handling the encoded one.

- Rename data_width to data-width in the device tree bindings

  The change leaves the support for the old format as well just in case someone
  will use a newer kernel with an old device tree blob.

- While here, replace dwc_fast_ffs() by __ffs()
