i40e/i40evf: Fix handling of boolean logic in polling routines

In the polling routines for i40e and i40evf we were using bitwise operators
to avoid the side effects of the logical operators, specifically the fact
that if the first case is true with "||" we skip the second case, or if it
is false with "&&" we skip the second case.  This fixes an earlier patch
that converted the bitwise operators over to the logical operators and
instead replaces the entire thing with just an if statement since it should
be more readable what we are trying to do this way.
