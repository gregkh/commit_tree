IB core: Add port_xmit_wait counter

Add the missing port_xmit_wait counter. This counter is displayed through
some tools like perfquery but is not available via sysfs.

For the PORT_PMA_ATTR macro the _counter field is set to zero
allowing us to specify the offset directly like with PORT_PMA_ATTR_EXT
