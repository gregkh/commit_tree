sparc32: fix build with STRICT_MM_TYPECHECKS

Based on recent thread on linux-arch (some weeks ago) I
decided to check how much work was required to build sparc32
with STRICT_MM_TYPECHECKS enabled.

The resulting binary (checked srmmu.o) was to my suprise smaller with
STRICT_MM_TYPECHECKS defined, than without.

As I have no working gear to test sparc32 bits at for the moment,
I did not enable STRICT_MM_TYPECHECKS - but was tempeted to do so.
