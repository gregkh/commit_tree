staging: unisys: visorbus: visorchipset_init clean up gotos

Several error paths were not logging a message to s-Par during failure.
Error paths in visorchipset_init() were corrected so that they now all
do proper clean-ups. This made it necessary to move the function
visorchipset_file_cleanup() above visorchipset_init so it can be
referenced.
