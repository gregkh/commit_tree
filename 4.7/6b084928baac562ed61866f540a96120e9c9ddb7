tcp: use one bit in TCP_SKB_CB to mark ACK timestamps

Currently, to avoid a cache line miss for accessing skb_shinfo,
tcp_ack_tstamp skips socket that do not have
SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_ACK bit set in sk_tsflags. This is
implemented based on an implicit assumption that the
SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_ACK is set via socket options for the
duration that ACK timestamps are needed.

To implement per-write timestamps, this check should be
removed and replaced with a per-packet alternative that
quickly skips packets missing ACK timestamps marks without
a cache-line miss.

To enable per-packet marking without a cache line miss, use
one bit in TCP_SKB_CB to mark a whether a SKB might need a
ack tx timestamp or not. Further checks in tcp_ack_tstamp are not
modified and work as before.
