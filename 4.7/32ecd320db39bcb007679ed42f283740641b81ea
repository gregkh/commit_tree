mmc: longer timeout for long read time quirk

008GE0 Toshiba mmc in some Intel Baytrail tablets responds to
MMC_SEND_EXT_CSD in 450-600ms.

This patch will...

() Increase the long read time quirk timeout from 300ms to 600ms. Original
   author of that quirk says 300ms was only a guess and that the number
   may need to be raised in the future.

() Add this specific MMC to the quirk
