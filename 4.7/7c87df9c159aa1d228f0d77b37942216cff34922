bcache: bch_writeback_thread() is not freezable

bch_writeback_thread() is calling try_to_freeze(), but that's just an
expensive no-op given the fact that the thread is not marked freezable.

I/O helper kthreads, exactly such as the bcache writeback thread, actually
shouldn't be freezable, because they are potentially necessary for
finalizing the image write-out.
