drm/i915: Reorganize intel_rotation_info

Throw out a bunch of unnecessary stuff from struct intel_rotation_info,
and pull most of the remaining stuff to live under an array of
per-color plane sub-structures.

What still remains outside the sub-structure will be reorgranized later
as well, but that requires more work elsewhere so leave it be for now.

v2: Split the vma size == luma+chroma size fix to prep patch (Daniel)
