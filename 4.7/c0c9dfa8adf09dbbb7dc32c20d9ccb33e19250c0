mtd: nand: sunxi: poll for events instead of using interrupts

Some NAND operations are so fast that it doesn't make any sense to use
interrupt based waits (the scheduling overhead is not worth it).
Rename sunxi_nfc_wait_int() into sunxi_nfc_wait_events() and add a
parameter to specify whether polling should be used or not.

Note that all sunxi_nfc_wait_int() are moved to the polling approach now,
but this should change as soon as we have more information about the
approximate time we are about to wait (can be extracted from the NAND
timings, and the type of operation).
