xenbus: don't bail early from xenbus_dev_request_and_reply()

xenbus_dev_request_and_reply() needs to track whether a transaction is
open.  For XS_TRANSACTION_START messages it calls transaction_start()
and for XS_TRANSACTION_END messages it calls transaction_end().

If sending an XS_TRANSACTION_START message fails or responds with an
an error, the transaction is not open and transaction_end() must be
called.

If sending an XS_TRANSACTION_END message fails, the transaction is
still open, but if an error response is returned the transaction is
closed.

Commit 027bd7e89906 ("xen/xenbus: Avoid synchronous wait on XenBus
stalling shutdown/restart") introduced a regression where failed
XS_TRANSACTION_START messages were leaving the transaction open.  This
can cause problems with suspend (and migration) as all transactions
must be closed before suspending.

It appears that the problematic change was added accidentally, so just
remove it.
