gre: Move utility functions to common headers

Several of the GRE functions defined in net/ipv4/ip_gre.c are usable
for IPv6 GRE implementation (that is they are protocol agnostic).

These include:
  - GRE flag handling functions are move to gre.h
  - GRE build_header is moved to gre.h and renamed gre_build_header
  - parse_gre_header is moved to gre_demux.c and renamed gre_parse_header
  - iptunnel_pull_header is taken out of gre_parse_header. This is now
    done by caller. The header length is returned from gre_parse_header
    in an int* argument.
