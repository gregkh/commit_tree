Btrfs: Refactor btrfs_lock_cluster() to kill compiler warning

fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c: In function ‘btrfs_lock_cluster’:
fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c:6399: warning: ‘used_bg’ may be used uninitialized in this function

  - Replace "again: ... goto again;" by standard C "while (1) { ... }",
  - Move block not processed during the first iteration of the loop to the
    end of the loop, which allows to kill the "locked" variable,
