s390/bpf: fix recache skb->data/hlen for skb_vlan_push/pop

In case of usage of skb_vlan_push/pop, in the prologue we store
the SKB pointer on the stack and restore it after BPF_JMP_CALL
to skb_vlan_push/pop.

Unfortunately currently there are two bugs in the code:

 1) The wrong stack slot (offset 170 instead of 176) is used
 2) The wrong register (W1 instead of B1) is saved

So fix this and use correct stack slot and register.
