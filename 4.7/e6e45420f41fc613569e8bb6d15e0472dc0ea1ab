iio: st_sensors: simplify buffer address handling

The driver goes to some length to dynamically allocate an array
to hold the channel addresses. However no ST sensor has more than
three channels (x, y, z at most). Instead of kmalloc():ing and
kfree():in the address array, just use a fixed array of three
elements.
