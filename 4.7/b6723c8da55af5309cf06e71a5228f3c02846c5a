drm/amdgpu: use ref to keep job alive

this is to fix fatal page fault error that occured if:
job is signaled/released after its timeout work is already
put to the global queue (in this case the cancel_delayed_work
will return false), which will lead to NX-protection error
page fault during job_timeout_func.
