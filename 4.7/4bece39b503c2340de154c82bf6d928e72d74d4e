powerpc/mm: Drop PTE_ATOMIC_UPDATES from pmd_hugepage_update()

pmd_hugepage_update() is inside #ifdef CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE. THP
can only be enabled if PPC_BOOK3S_64=y && PPC_64K_PAGES=y, aka. hash64.

On hash64 we always define PTE_ATOMIC_UPDATES to 1, meaning the #ifdef
in pmd_hugepage_update() is unnecessary, so drop it.

That is also the only use of PTE_ATOMIC_UPDATES in any of the hash code,
meaning we no longer need to #define it at all in the hash headers.

Note it's still #defined and used in the nohash code.
