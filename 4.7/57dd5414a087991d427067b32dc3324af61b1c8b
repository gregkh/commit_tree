ALSA: usb-audio: Limit retrying sample rate reads

There are many USB audio devices with buggy firmware that don't react
with the sample rate reading properly.  This often results in the
flood of error messages and slowing down the operation.

The sample rate read back is basically only for confirming the sample
rate setup, and it's not critically important.  As a compromise, in
this patch, we stop the sample rate read back once when the device
gives errors more than tolerance (twice, as of now).  This should
improve most of error cases while we still can catch the firmware
bugginess.
