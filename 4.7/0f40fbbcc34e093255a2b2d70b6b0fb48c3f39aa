Fix OpenSSH pty regression on close

OpenSSH expects the (non-blocking) read() of pty master to return
EAGAIN only if it has received all of the slave-side output after
it has received SIGCHLD. This used to work on pre-3.12 kernels.

This fix effectively forces non-blocking read() and poll() to
block for parallel i/o to complete for all ttys. It also unwinds
these changes:

1) f8747d4a466ab2cafe56112c51b3379f9fdb7a12
   tty: Fix pty master read() after slave closes

2) 52bce7f8d4fc633c9a9d0646eef58ba6ae9a3b73
   pty, n_tty: Simplify input processing on final close

3) 1a48632ffed61352a7810ce089dc5a8bcd505a60
   pty: Fix input race when closing
