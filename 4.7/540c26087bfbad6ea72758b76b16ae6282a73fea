Input: xpad - fix rumble on Xbox One controllers with 2015 firmware

Xbox One controllers that shipped with or were upgraded to the 2015
firmware discard the current rumble packets we send. This patch changes
the Xbox One rumble packet to a form that both the newer and older
firmware will accept.

It is based on changes made to support newer Xbox One controllers in
the SteamOS brewmaster-4.1 kernel branch.
