cpufreq: governor: CPUFREQ_GOV_POLICY_EXIT never fails

None of the cpufreq governors currently in the tree will ever fail
an invocation of the ->governor() callback with the event argument
equal to CPUFREQ_GOV_POLICY_EXIT (unless invoked with incorrect
arguments which doesn't matter anyway) and it wouldn't really
make sense to fail it, because the caller won't be able to handle
that failure in a meaningful way.

Accordingly, rearrange the code in the core to make it clear that
this call never fails.
