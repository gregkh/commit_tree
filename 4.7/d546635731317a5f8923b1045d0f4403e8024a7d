iommu/arm-smmu: Use per-domain page sizes.

Now that we can accurately reflect the context format we choose for each
domain, do that instead of imposing the global lowest-common-denominator
restriction and potentially ending up with nothing. We currently have a
strict 1:1 correspondence between domains and context banks, so we don't
need to entertain the possibility of multiple formats _within_ a domain.
