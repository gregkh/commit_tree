btrfs: fix int32 overflow in shrink_delalloc().

UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c:4623:21
signed integer overflow:
10808 * 262144 cannot be represented in type 'int [8]'

If 8192<=items<16384, we request a writeback of an insane number of pages
which is benign (everything will be written).  But if items>=16384, the
space reservation won't be enough.
