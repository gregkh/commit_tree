coresight: adding path for STM device

>From a core framework point of view an STM device is a source that is
treated the same way as any other tracers.  Unlike tracers though STM
devices are not associated with a CPU.  As such it doesn't make sense
to associate the path from an STM device to its sink with a per-cpu
variable as it is done for tracers.

This patch simply adds another global variable to keep STM paths and the
processing in coresight_enable/disable() is updated to deal with STM
devices properly.
