net/mlx5: Update mlx5_ifc hardware features

Adding the needed mlx5_ifc hardware bits and structs
for the following features:

* Add vport to steering commands for SRIOV ACL support
* Add mlcr, pcmr and mcia registers for dump module EEPROM
* Add support for FCS, beacon led and disable_link bits to
  hca caps
* Add CQE period mode bit in CQ context for CQE based CQ
  moderation support
* Add umr SQ bit for fragmented memory registration
* Add needed bits and caps for Striding RQ support

In-order to avoid possible future conflicts between rdma and
net-next we added all expected updates to this file for this release.
If more changes will be submitted, we plan to do it only through
one of the subsystems, probably net-next.

All updated bits in this patch will be later used in
the up-coming submissions to net-next and rdma trees.
