drm/imx: Match imx-ipuv3-crtc components using device node in platform data

The component master driver imx-drm-core matches component devices using
their of_node. Since commit 950b410dd1ab ("gpu: ipu-v3: Fix imx-ipuv3-crtc
module autoloading"), the imx-ipuv3-crtc dev->of_node is not set during
probing. Before that, of_node was set and caused an of: modalias to be
used instead of the platform: modalias, which broke module autoloading.

On the other hand, if dev->of_node is not set yet when the imx-ipuv3-crtc
probe function calls component_add, component matching in imx-drm-core
fails. While dev->of_node will be set once the next component tries to
bring up the component master, imx-drm-core component binding will never
succeed if one of the crtc devices is probed last.

Add of_node to the component platform data and match against the
pdata->of_node instead of dev->of_node in imx-drm-core to work around
this problem.
