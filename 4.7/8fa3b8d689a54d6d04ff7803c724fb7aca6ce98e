cgroup: set css->id to -1 during init

If percpu_ref initialization fails during css_create(), the free path
can end up trying to free css->id of zero.  As ID 0 is unused, it
doesn't cause a critical breakage but it does trigger a warning
message.  Fix it by setting css->id to -1 from init_and_link_css().
