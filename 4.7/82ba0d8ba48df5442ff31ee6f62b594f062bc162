Input: twl4030 - fix unsafe macro definition

The bitwise shift operator has lower priority than plus operator. So the
values on macros should be enclosed in parentheses.

For example, "(1 << 4 + 1)" means "(1 << (4 + 1))", but it is not expected
by the macros.

And also fix other two coding style problems reported by
scripts/checkpatch.pl.
