arm64: Reduce verbosity on SMP CPU stop

When CPUs are stopped during an abnormal operation like panic
for each CPU a line is printed and the stack trace is dumped.

This information is only interesting for the aborting CPU
and on systems with many CPUs it only makes it harder to
debug if after the aborting CPU the log is flooded with data
about all other CPUs too.

Therefore remove the stack dump and printk of other CPUs
and only print a single line that the other CPUs are going to be
stopped and, in case any CPUs remain online list them.
