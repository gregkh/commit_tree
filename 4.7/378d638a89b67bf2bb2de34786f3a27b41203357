staging: unisys: include: removed unused 'visor_device.description'

The 'description' variable in visor_device was added in preparation for
removing the 'device_info' struct when the uislib files were removed.

That attribute is never accessed nor set, and the 'name' attribute
provides enough information to correctly identify the driver, it is not
needed.
