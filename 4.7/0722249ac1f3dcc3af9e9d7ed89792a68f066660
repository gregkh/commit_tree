PM / devfreq: exynos: Add generic exynos bus frequency driver

This patch adds the generic exynos bus frequency driver for AMBA AXI bus
of sub-blocks in exynos SoC with DEVFREQ framework. The Samsung Exynos SoC
have the common architecture for bus between DRAM and sub-blocks in SoC.
This driver can support the generic bus frequency driver for Exynos SoCs.

In devicetree, Each bus block has a bus clock, regulator, operation-point
and devfreq-event devices which measure the utilization of each bus block.
