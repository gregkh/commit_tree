security: drop the unused hook skb_owned_by

The skb_owned_by hook was added with the commit ca10b9e9a8ca
("selinux: add a skb_owned_by() hook") and later removed
when said commit was reverted.

Later on, when switching to list of hooks, a field named
'skb_owned_by' was included into the security_hook_head struct,
but without any users nor caller.

This commit removes the said left-over field.
