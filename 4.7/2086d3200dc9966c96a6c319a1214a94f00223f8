KVM: shrink halt polling even more for invalid wakeups

commit 3491caf2755e ("KVM: halt_polling: provide a way to qualify
 wakeups during poll") added more aggressive shrinking of the
polling interval if the wakeup did not match some criteria. This
still allows to keep polling enabled if the polling time was
smaller that the current max poll time (block_ns <= vcpu->halt_poll_ns).
Performance measurement shows that even more aggressive shrinking
(shrink polling on any invalid wakeup) reduces absolute and relative
(to the workload) CPU usage even further.
