dmaengine: bcm2835: add slave_sg support to bcm2835-dma

Add slave_sg support to bcm2835-dma using shared allocation
code for bcm2835_desc and DMA-control blocks already used by
dma_cyclic.

Note that bcm2835_dma_callback had to get modified to support
both modes of operation (cyclic and non-cyclic).

Tested using:
* Hifiberry I2S card (using cyclic DMA)
* fb_st7735r SPI-framebuffer (using slave_sg DMA via spi-bcm2835)
playing BigBuckBunny for audio and video.
