drm/i915: Wait for vblank in i9xx_disable_crtc() for gen 2 only

The wait for other gens was added in commit 564ed191f5d8 ("drm/i915:
gmch: fix stuck primary plane due to memory self-refresh mode") since
that's necessary when disabling cxsr. However, cxsr disabling was later
moved to intel_pre_disable_primary() in commit 87d4300a7dbc ("drm/i915:
Move intel_(pre_disable/post_enable)_primary to intel_display.c, and use
it there.") and that function got its own vblank wait for cxsr in commit
262cd2e154c2 ("drm/i915: CHV DDR DVFS support and another watermark
rewrite"). So remove the extra vblank wait from i9xx_crtc_distable().
