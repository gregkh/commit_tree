drm/i915: Split out load time early initialization

According to the new init phases scheme we should initialize "SW-only"
state not requiring accessing the device as the very first step, so that
the reasoning about dependencies of later steps becomes easier. So move
these init steps into a separate function. This also has the benefit of
making the error path cleaner both in the new function and int
i915_driver_load()/unload().

No functional change.
