ixgbe: Take manageability semaphore for firmware commands

We need to take the manageability semaphore when issuing firmware
commands to avoid problems. With this in place, the semaphore is
no longer taken in the ixgbe_set_fw_drv_ver_generic function, since
it will now always be taken by the ixgbe_host_interface_command
function.
