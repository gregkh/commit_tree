MIPS: smp-cps: Pull boot config retrieval out of mips_cps_boot_vpes

The mips_cps_boot_vpes function previously included code to retrieve
pointers to the core & VPE boot configuration structs. These structures
were used both by mips_cps_boot_vpes and by its mips_cps_core_entry
callsite. In preparation for skipping the call to mips_cps_boot_vpes on
some invocations of mips_cps_core_entry, pull the calculation of those
pointers out into a separate function such that it can continue to be
shared.
