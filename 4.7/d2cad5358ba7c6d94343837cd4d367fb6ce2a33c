drm/i915: Consolidate common error handling in intel_pin_and_map_ringbuffer_obj

After we pin the ringbuffer into the GGTT, all error paths need to unpin
it again. Move this common step into one block, and make the unable to
iomap error code consistent (i.e. treat it as out of memory to avoid
confusing it with a invalid argument).
