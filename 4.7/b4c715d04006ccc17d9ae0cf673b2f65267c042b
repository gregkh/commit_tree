i2c: octeon: Improve error status checking

Introduce a function that checks for valid status codes depending
on the phase of a transmit or receive. Also add all existing status
codes and improve error handling for various states.

The Octeon TWSI has an "assert acknowledge" bit (TWSI_CTL_AAK) that
is required to be set in master receive mode until the last byte is
requested. The state check needs to consider if this bit was set.
