powerpc/fsl: Fix build of the dtb embedded kernel images

Commit dc37374b9c833 ("powerpc/fsl: Move Freescale device tree files
into fsl folder") moved a lot of device tree files into fsl directory,
fixing Makefile for cuImage target only.  Unfortunately there are other
targets which require embedding a device tree into the kernel image
(e.g. dtbImage.%).  So use a more generic approach.
