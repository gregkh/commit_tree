KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Manage single-step mode

Until now, when we connect gdb to the QEMU gdb-server, the
single-step mode is not managed.

This patch adds this, only for kvm-pr:

If KVM_GUESTDBG_SINGLESTEP is set, we enable single-step trace bit in the
MSR (MSR_SE) just before the __kvmppc_vcpu_run(), and disable it just after.
In kvmppc_handle_exit_pr, instead of routing the interrupt to
the guest, we return to host, with KVM_EXIT_DEBUG reason.
