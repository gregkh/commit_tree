libata: support device-managed ZAC devices

Device-managed ZAC devices just set the zoned capabilities field
in INQUIRY byte 69 (cf ACS-4). This corresponds to the 'zoned'
field in the block device characteristics VPD page.
As this is only defined in SPC-5/SBC-4 we also need to update
the supported SCSI version descriptor.
