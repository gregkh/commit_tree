powerpc/mm: Add pte_xchg() helper

We have five locations in 64-bit hash MMU code that do a cmpxchg() of a
PTE. Currently doing it inline OK, but in a future patch we will be
converting the PTEs to __be64 in some configs. In that case we will need
casts at every cmpxchg() site in order to keep sparse happy.

So move the logic into a helper, this is a reasonably nice cleanup on
its own.
