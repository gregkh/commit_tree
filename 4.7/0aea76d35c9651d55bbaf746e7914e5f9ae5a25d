tcp: SYN packets are now simply consumed

We now have proper per-listener but also per network namespace counters
for SYN packets that might be dropped.

We replace the kfree_skb() by consume_skb() to be drop monitor [1]
friendly, and remove an obsolete comment.
FastOpen SYN packets can carry payload in them just fine.

[1] perf record -a -g -e skb:kfree_skb sleep 1; perf report
