ata: sata_dwc_460ex: fix crash on offline links without an attached drive

This patch fixes Machine Check "Data Write PLB Error" which happens
when libata-sff's ata_sff_dev_select is trying to write into the
device_addr in order to select a drive. However, SATA has no master
or slave devices like the old ATA Bus, therefore selecting a
different drive is kind of pointless.
