bpf, trace: add BPF_F_CURRENT_CPU flag for bpf_perf_event_output

Add a BPF_F_CURRENT_CPU flag to optimize the use-case where user space has
per-CPU ring buffers and the eBPF program pushes the data into the current
CPU's ring buffer which saves us an extra helper function call in eBPF.
Also, make sure to properly reserve the remaining flags which are not used.
