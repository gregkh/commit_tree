net: phy: Manage fixed PHY address space using IDA

If we have a system which uses fixed PHY devices and calls
fixed_phy_register() then fixed_phy_unregister() we can exhaust the
number of fixed PHYs available after a while, since we keep incrementing
the variable phy_fixed_addr, but we never decrement it.

This patch fixes that by converting the fixed PHY allocation to using
IDA, which takes care of the allocation/dealloaction of the PHY
addresses for us.
