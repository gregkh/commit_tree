PCI: Fix unaligned accesses in VC code

The save/restore buffers for VC state is first composed of a 2-byte control
register, then a bunch of 4-byte words.

This causes unaligned accesses which trap on platform such as sparc.

This is easy to fix by simply moving the buffer pointer forward by 4 bytes
instead of 2 after dealing with the control register.  The length
adjustment needs to be changed likewise as well.
