net: mediatek: fix off by one in the TX ring allocation

The TX ring setup has an off by one error causing it to not utilise all
descriptors. This has the side effect that we need to reset the next
pointer at runtime to make it work. Fix the off by one and remove the
code fixing the ring at runtime.
