staging/lustre: Reintroduce global env list

This reverts a patch that was merged before lustre client
was introduced into the stagign tree, so it's not in the history.

The performance dropped a lot when memory reclaim process kicked
in as ll_releasepage() was called to destroy lustre pages. It turned
out that big overhead to allocate cl_env and keys on the fly so we
have to revert this patch.

The original problem for the reverted patch would be solved in a
follow on patch instead.
