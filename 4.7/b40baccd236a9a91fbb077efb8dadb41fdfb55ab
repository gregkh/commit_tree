clk: rockchip: add new pll-type for rk3399 and similar socs

The rk3399's pll and clock are similar with rk3036's, it different
with base on the rk3066(rk3188, rk3288, rk3368 use it), there are
different adjust foctors and control registers, so these should be
independent and separate from the series of rk3066s.
