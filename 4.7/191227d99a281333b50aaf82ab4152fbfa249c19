ALSA: usb-audio: allow clock source validity interrupts

miniDSP USBStreamer UAC2 devices send clock validity changes with the
control field set to zero. The current interrupt handler ignores all
packets if the control field does not match the mixer element's, but
it really should only do that in case that field is needed to
distinguish multiple elements with the same ID.

This patch implements a logic that lets notifications packets pass
if the element ID is unique for a given device.
