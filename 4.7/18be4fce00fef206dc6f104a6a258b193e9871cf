ixgbe: Do not allow PF to add VLVF entry unless it actually needs it

While doing the work on igb I realized there were a few cases where we were
still adding VLANs to the VLVF entries for the PF when they were not
needed.  This patch cleans that up so that the only time we add a PF entry
to the VLVF is either for VLAN 0 or if the PF has requested a VLAN that a VF
is already using.
