irqchip/gic: Restore CPU interface checking

When introducing the whole CPU feature detection framework,
we lost the capability to detect a mismatched GIC configuration
(using the GICv2 MMIO interface, but having the system register
interface enabled).

In order to solve this, use the new this_cpu_has_cap() helper.
Also move the check to the CPU interface path in order to catch
systems where the first CPU has been correctly configured,
but the secondaries are not.
