clk: renesas: r8a7795: add R clk

R can select between two parents. We deal with it like this: During
initialization, check if EXTALR is populated. If so, use it for R. If
not, use R_Internal. clk_mux doesn't help here because we don't want to
switch parents depending on the clock rate. The clock rate (and source)
should stay constant for the watchdog, so I think a setup like this
during initialization makes sense.
