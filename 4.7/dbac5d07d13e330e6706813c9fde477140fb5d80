usb: musb: host: don't start next rx urb if current one failed

urb->status is set when endpoint csr RXSTALL, H_ERROR, DATAERROR or
INCOMPRX bit is set. Those bits mean a broken pipe, so don't start next
urb when any of these bits is set by checking urb->status.

To minimize the risk of regression, only do so for RX, until we have a
test case to understand the behavior of TX.

The patch fixes system freeze issue caused by repeatedly invoking RX ISR
while removing a usb uart device connected to a hub, in which case the
hub has no chance to report the disconnect event due to the kernel is
busy in processing the RX interrupt flooding.

Fix checkpatch complaint (qh != NULL) as while.
