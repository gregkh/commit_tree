radix-tree: fix extending the tree for multi-order entries at offset 0

The current code will insert entries at each level, as if we're going to
add a new entry at the bottom level, so we then get an -EEXIST when we
try to insert the entry into the tree.  The best way to fix this is to
not check 'order' when inserting into an empty tree.

We still need to 'extend' the tree to the height necessary for the maximum
index corresponding to this entry, so pass that value to
radix_tree_extend() rather than the index we're asked to create, or we
won't create a tree that's deep enough.
