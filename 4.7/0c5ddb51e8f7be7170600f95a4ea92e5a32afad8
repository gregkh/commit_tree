net/mlx4_en: initialize cmd.context_lock spinlock earlier

Maciej Żenczykowski reported lockdep warning a spinlock
was not registered before being held in mlx4_cmd_wake_completions()

cmd.context_lock initialization is not at the right place.

1) mlx4_cmd_use_events() can be called multiple times.
   Calling spin_lock_init() on a live spinlock can lead
   to hangs.

2) mlx4_cmd_wake_completions() can be called while lock
   has not been initialized.
   Lockdep complains, and current logic is not race prone.

It seems better to move the initialization earlier in
mlx4_load_one()
