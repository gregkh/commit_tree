clk: rockchip: mark rk3399 GIC clocks as critical

We never want to kill the GIC.

Noticed when making other clock fixups, and seeing the newly-constructed
clock tree try to disable cpll, where we had this parent structure:

  aclk_gic <------\
                  |--- aclk_gic_pre <-- cpll <-- pll_cpll
  aclk_gic_noc <--/
