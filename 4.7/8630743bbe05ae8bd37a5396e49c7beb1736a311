ARM: dts: imx6: add support for the Ka-Ro electronics 'MB7' baseboard

This baseboard can be used with all TX6 SoMs, but only a certain set
of combinations can be ordered by default. Add support for these
combinations in mainline, so that users can easily adopt their own
combination of SoM and baseboard themselves.
