drm: bridge: analogix/dp: remove duplicate configuration of link rate and link count

link_rate and lane_count already configured in analogix_dp_set_link_train(),
so we don't need to config those repeatly after training finished, just
remove them out.

Beside Display Port 1.2 already support 5.4Gbps link rate, the maximum sets
would change from {1.62Gbps, 2.7Gbps} to {1.62Gbps, 2.7Gbps, 5.4Gbps}.
