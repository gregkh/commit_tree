KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Rely on the GIC driver to parse the firmware tables

Currently, the firmware tables are parsed 2 times: once in the GIC
drivers, the other time when initializing the vGIC. It means code
duplication and make more tedious to add the support for another
firmware table (like ACPI).

Use the recently introduced helper gic_get_kvm_info() to get
information about the virtual GIC.

With this change, the virtual GIC becomes agnostic to the firmware
table and KVM will be able to initialize the vGIC on ACPI.
