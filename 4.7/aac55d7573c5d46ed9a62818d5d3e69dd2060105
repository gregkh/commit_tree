powerpc/mm/hash64: Fix subpage protection with 4K HPTE config

With Linux page size of 64K and hardware only supporting 4K HPTE, if we
use subpage protection, we always fail for the subpage 0 as shown
below (using the selftest subpage_prot test):

  520175565:  (4520111850): Failed at 0x3fffad4b0000 (p=13,sp=0,w=0), want=fault, got=pass !
  4520890210: (4520826495): Failed at 0x3fffad5b0000 (p=29,sp=0,w=0), want=fault, got=pass !
  4521574251: (4521510536): Failed at 0x3fffad6b0000 (p=45,sp=0,w=0), want=fault, got=pass !
  4522258324: (4522194609): Failed at 0x3fffad7b0000 (p=61,sp=0,w=0), want=fault, got=pass !

This is because hash preload wrongly inserts the HPTE entry for subpage
0 without looking at the subpage protection information.

Fix it by teaching should_hash_preload() not to preload if we have
subpage protection configured for that range.

It appears this has been broken since it was introduced in 2008.
