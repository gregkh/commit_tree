powerpc/bpf/jit: Disable classic BPF JIT on ppc64le

Classic BPF JIT was never ported completely to work on little endian
powerpc. However, it can be enabled and will crash the system when used.
As such, disable use of BPF JIT on ppc64le.

Fixes: 7c105b63bd98 ("powerpc: Add CONFIG_CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN kernel config option.")
