scripts/package/Makefile: rpmbuild add support of RPMOPTS

After commit 21a59991ce0c ("scripts/package/Makefile: rpmbuild is needed
for rpm targets"), it is no longer possible to specify RPMOPTS.
For example, we can no longer able to control _topdir using the following
make command.
make RPMOPTS="--define '_topdir /home/xyz/workspace/'" binrpm-pkg
