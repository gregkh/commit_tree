radix-tree: tidy up __radix_tree_create()

1. Rename the existing variable 'slot' to 'child'.
2. Introduce a new variable called 'slot' which is the address of the
   slot we're dealing with.  This lets us simplify the tree insertion,
   and removes the recalculation of 'slot' at the end of the function.
3. Using 'slot' in the sibling pointer insertion part makes the code
   more readable.
