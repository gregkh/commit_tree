ARM: 8567/1: cache-uniphier: activate ways for secondary CPUs

This outer cache allows to control active ways independently for
each CPU, but currently nothing is done for secondary CPUs.  In
other words, all the ways are locked for secondary CPUs by default.
This commit fixes it to fully bring out the performance of this
outer cache.

There would be two possible ways to achieve this:

[1] Each CPU initializes active ways for itself.  This can be done
    via the SSCLPDAWCR register.  This is a banked register, so each
    CPU sees a different instance of the register for its own.

[2] The master CPU initializes active ways for all the CPUs.  This
    is available via SSCDAWCARMR(N) registers, where all instances
    of SSCLPDAWCR are mirrored.  They are mapped at the address
    SSCDAWCARMR + 4 * N, where N is the CPU number.

The outer cache frame work does not support a per-CPU init callback.
So this commit adopts [2]; the master CPU iterates over possible CPUs
setting up SSCDAWCARMR(N) registers.
