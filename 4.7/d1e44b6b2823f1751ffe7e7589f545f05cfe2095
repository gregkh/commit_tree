regulator: qcom_smd: add regulator ops for pm8941 lnldo

After "regulator: qcom_smd: add list_voltage callback" patch adding
pm8941 lnldo regulators would bug on list_voltages as it is a fixed
regulator without any linear range.
This patch fixes that issue by adding dedicated ops for pm8941 lnldo
without list_voltages callback.
