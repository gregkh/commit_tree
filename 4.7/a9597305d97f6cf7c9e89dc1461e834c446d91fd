regulator: max77686: Configure enable time to properly handle regulator enable

The enable time for buck regulators was not configured but actually is
essential: consumers, like usb3503, doing hard reset (regulator off/on)
should wait for the regulator to settle.

Configure the enable time according to datasheet.
