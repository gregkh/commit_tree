drm: Wrap direct calls to driver->gem_free_object from CMA

Since the introduction of (struct_mutex) lockless GEM bo freeing, there
are a pair of driver vfuncs for freeing the GEM bo, of which the driver
may choose to only implement driver->gem_object_free_unlocked (and so
avoid taking the struct_mutex along the free path). However, the CMA GEM
helpers were still calling driver->gem_free_object directly, now NULL,
and promptly dying on the fancy new lockless drivers. Oops.

Robert Foss bisected this to b82caafcf2303 (drm/vc4: Use lockless gem BO
free callback) on his vc4 device, but that just serves as an enabler for
9f0ba539d13ae (drm/gem: support BO freeing without dev->struct_mutex).
