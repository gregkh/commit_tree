tracing: Support string type key properly

The string in a trace event is usually recorded as dynamic array which
is variable length.  But current hist code only support fixed length
array so it cannot support most strings.

This patch fixes it by checking filter_type of the field and get
proper pointer with it.  With this, it can get a histogram of exec()
based on filenames like below:

  # cd /sys/kernel/tracing/events/sched/sched_process_exec
  # cat 'hist:key=filename' > trigger
  # ps
   PID TTY       TIME CMD
     1 ?     00:00:00 init
    29 ?     00:00:00 sh
    38 ?     00:00:00 ps
  # ls
  enable  filter  format  hist  id  trigger
  # cat hist
  # trigger info: hist:keys=filename:vals=hitcount:sort=hitcount:size=2048 [active]

  { filename: /usr/bin/ps                         } hitcount:          1
  { filename: /usr/bin/ls                         } hitcount:          1
  { filename: /usr/bin/cat                        } hitcount:          1
