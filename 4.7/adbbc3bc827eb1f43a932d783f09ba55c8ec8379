mtd: create an mtd_ooblayout_ops struct to ease ECC layout definition

ECC layout definitions are currently exposed using the nand_ecclayout
struct which embeds oobfree and eccpos arrays with predefined size.
This approach was acceptable when NAND chips were providing relatively
small OOB regions, but MLC and TLC now provide OOB regions of several
hundreds of bytes, which implies a non negligible overhead for everybody
even those who only need to support legacy NANDs.

Create an mtd_ooblayout_ops interface providing the same functionality
(expose the ECC and oobfree layout) without the need for this huge
structure.

The mtd->ecclayout is now deprecated and should be replaced by the
equivalent mtd_ooblayout_ops. In the meantime we provide a wrapper around
the ->ecclayout field to ease migration to this new model.
