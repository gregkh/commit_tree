iio: accel: bmg160: optimize transfers in trigger handler

Some i2c busses (e.g.: Synopsys DesignWare I2C adapter) need to
enable/disable the bus at each i2c transfer and must wait for
the enable/disable to happen before sending the data.

When reading data in the trigger handler, the bmg160 gyro driver does
one bus transfer for each axis. This has an impact on the frequency
of the accelerometer at high sample rates due to additional delays
introduced by the bus at each transfer.

Reading all axis values in one bus transfer reduces the delays
introduced by the bus.
