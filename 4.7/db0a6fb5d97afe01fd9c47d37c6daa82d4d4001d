audit: add tty field to LOGIN event

The tty field was missing from AUDIT_LOGIN events.

Refactor code to create a new function audit_get_tty(), using it to
replace the call in audit_log_task_info() and to add it to
audit_log_set_loginuid().  Lock and bump the kref to protect it, adding
audit_put_tty() alias to decrement it.
