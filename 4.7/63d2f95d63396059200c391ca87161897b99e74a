fs/nilfs2: fix potential underflow in call to crc32_le

The value `bytes' comes from the filesystem which is about to be
mounted.  We cannot trust that the value is always in the range we
expect it to be.

Check its value before using it to calculate the length for the crc32_le
call.  It value must be larger (or equal) sumoff + 4.

This fixes a kernel bug when accidentially mounting an image file which
had the nilfs2 magic value 0x3434 at the right offset 0x406 by chance.
The bytes 0x01 0x00 were stored at 0x408 and were interpreted as a
s_bytes value of 1.  This caused an underflow when substracting sumoff +
4 (20) in the call to crc32_le.
