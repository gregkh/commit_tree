MIPS: Loongson: Invalidate special TLBs when needed

Loongson-2 has a 4 entry itlb which is a subset of jtlb, Loongson-3 has
a 4 entry itlb and a 4 entry dtlb which are subsets of jtlb. We should
write diag register to invalidate itlb/dtlb when flushing jtlb because
itlb/dtlb are not totally transparent to software.

For Loongson-3A R2 (and newer), we should invalidate ITLB, DTLB, VTLB
and FTLB before we enable/disable FTLB.
