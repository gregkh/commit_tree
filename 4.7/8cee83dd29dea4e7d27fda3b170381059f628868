tipc: fix stale links after re-enabling bearer

Commit 42b18f605fea ("tipc: refactor function tipc_link_timeout()"),
introduced a bug which prevents sending of probe messages during
link synchronization phase. This leads to hanging links, if the
bearer is disabled/enabled after links are up.

In this commit, we send the probe messages correctly.
