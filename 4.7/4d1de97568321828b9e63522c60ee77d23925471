drm/i915/bxt: add dsi transcoders

The BXT display connections have DSI transcoders A and C that can be
muxed to any pipe, not unlike the eDP transcoder. Add the notion of DSI
transcoders.

The "normal" transcoders A, B and C are not used with BXT DSI, so care
must be taken to avoid accessing those registers with DSI transcoders in
the hardware state readout, modeset, and generally everywhere.

v2: addressing comments by Ville:
 - rename the dsi get config function to hsw_get_dsi_transcoder_state
 - rebase onto the higher level split of pipe/transcoder functions
 - use more has_dsi_encoder as we can now because of the above,
   with no need to look at the transcoder so much
 - rename IS_DSI_TRANSCODER to transcoder_is_dsi
 - use the above a bit more instead of comparing to < TRANSCODER_EDP
