radix tree test suite: rebuild when headers change

When we make changes to radix-tree.h in the regular kernel source
(include/linux/radix-tree.h), we really want our test code to be
rebuilt.

We also include a few other headers from tools/include and probably want
to rebuild if these have been changed.

Update the makefile so that all of our objects will be rebuilt when any
of the headers we depend on are changed.
