xfs: add missing break in xfs_parseargs()

Commit 2e74af0e1189 ("xfs: convert mount option parsing to tokens")
missed a 'break;' in xfs_parseargs() which causes mount to fail with
"-o pqnoenforce" option when mounting a v4 filesystem. xfs/050
catches this failure:

XFS (vda6): Super block does not support project and group quota together
