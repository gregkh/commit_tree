nfs: have ff_layout_get_ds_cred take a reference to the cred

In later patches, we're going to want to allow the creds to be updated
when we get a new layout with updated creds. Have this function take
a reference to the cred that is later put once the call has been
dispatched.

Also, prepare for this change by ensuring we follow RCU rules when
getting a reference to the cred as well.
