MIPS: Simplify DSP instruction encoding macros

Simplify the DSP instruction wrapper macros which use explicit encodings
for microMIPS and normal MIPS by using the new encoding macros and
removing duplication.

To me this makes it easier to read since it is much shorter, but it also
ensures .insn is used, preventing objdump disassembling the microMIPS
code as normal MIPS.
