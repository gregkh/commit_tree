arm64: vdso: avoid virt_to_page() translations on kernel symbols

The translation performed by virt_to_page() is only valid for linear
addresses, and kernel symbols are no longer in the linear mapping.
So perform the __pa() translation explicitly, which does the right
thing in either case, and only then translate to a struct page offset.
