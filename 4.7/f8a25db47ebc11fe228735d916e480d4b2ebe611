powerpc/powernv: Use the "unknown" checkstop type as a fallback

The HMI code knows about three types of errors: CORE, NX and UNKNOWN.
If OPAL were to add a new type, it would not be handled at all since
there is no fallback case.  Instead of explicitly checking for UNKNOWN,
treat any checkstop type without a handler as unknown.
