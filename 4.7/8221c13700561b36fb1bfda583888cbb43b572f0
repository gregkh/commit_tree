svm: Manage vcpu load/unload when enable AVIC

When a vcpu is loaded/unloaded to a physical core, we need to update
host physical APIC ID information in the Physical APIC-ID table
accordingly.

Also, when vCPU is blocking/un-blocking (due to halt instruction),
we need to make sure that the is-running bit in set accordingly in the
physical APIC-ID table.
