pwm: Add information about polarity, duty cycle and period to debugfs

The PWM states make it possible to also output the polarity, duty cycle
and period information in the debugfs summary output. This simplifies
gathering information about PWMs without needing to walk through the
sysfs attributes of every PWM.
