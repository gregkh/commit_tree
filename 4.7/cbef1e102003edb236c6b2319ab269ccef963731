batman-adv: Free last_bonding_candidate on release of orig_node

The orig_ifinfo reference counter for last_bonding_candidate in
batadv_orig_node has to be reduced when an originator node is released.
Otherwise the orig_ifinfo is leaked and the reference counter the netdevice
is not reduced correctly.
