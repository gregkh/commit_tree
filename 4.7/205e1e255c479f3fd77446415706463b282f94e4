ppp: defer netns reference release for ppp channel

Matt reported that we have a NULL pointer dereference
in ppp_pernet() from ppp_connect_channel(),
i.e. pch->chan_net is NULL.

This is due to that a parallel ppp_unregister_channel()
could happen while we are in ppp_connect_channel(), during
which pch->chan_net set to NULL. Since we need a reference
to net per channel, it makes sense to sync the refcnt
with the life time of the channel, therefore we should
release this reference when we destroy it.
