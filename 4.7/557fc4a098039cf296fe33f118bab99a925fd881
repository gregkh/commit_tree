fq: add fair queuing framework

This works on the same implementation principle as
codel*.h, i.e. there's a generic header with
structures and macros and a implementation header
carrying function definitions to include in given,
e.g. driver or module.

The fairness logic comes from
net/sched/sch_fq_codel.c but is generalized so it
is more flexible and easier to re-use.
