i40evf: RSS Hash Option parameters

This patch syncs the VF code for the changes made to the PF for the RSS
hash tuple settings.  Since the VF still cannot change the RSS hash
settings, change the code to make this clear to the user.  Previously,
the default settings were returned in this function. However, the
default can be changed by the PF so this does not make sense anymore.
