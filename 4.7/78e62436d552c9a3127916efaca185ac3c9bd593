ARM: dts: imx25-pinfunc: remove SION for pins with an UART handshaking input mode

With SION set the level on such a pin is reported to the UART. So for
example when the CS5 pin is configured for GPIO mode and the level
changes this triggers an RTS interrupt on uart5.

Adding some severity to this issue: The imx uart driver currently
doesn't handle correctly irqs for changes on RI and DCD which are
enabled automatically when the respective UART is driven in DTE mode
(that is, has the fsl,dte-mode property set in the device tree). This
results in a stuck machine because the irq isn't cleared and so stalls
the CPU.
