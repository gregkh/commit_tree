tracing: Add infrastructure to allow set_event_pid to follow children

Add the infrastructure needed to have the PIDs in set_event_pid to
automatically add PIDs of the children of the tasks that have their PIDs in
set_event_pid. This will also remove PIDs from set_event_pid when a task
exits

This is implemented by adding hooks into the fork and exit tracepoints. On
fork, the PIDs are added to the list, and on exit, they are removed.

Add a new option called event_fork that when set, PIDs in set_event_pid will
automatically get their children PIDs added when they fork, as well as any
task that exits will have its PID removed from set_event_pid.

This works for instances as well.
