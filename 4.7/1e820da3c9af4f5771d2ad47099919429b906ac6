MIPS: Loongson-3: Introduce CONFIG_LOONGSON3_ENHANCEMENT

New Loongson 3 CPU (since Loongson-3A R2, as opposed to Loongson-3A R1,
Loongson-3B R1 and Loongson-3B R2) has many enhancements, such as FTLB,
L1-VCache, EI/DI/Wait/Prefetch instruction, DSP/DSPv2 ASE, User Local
register, Read-Inhibit/Execute-Inhibit, SFB (Store Fill Buffer), Fast
TLB refill support, etc.

This patch introduce a config option, CONFIG_LOONGSON3_ENHANCEMENT, to
enable those enhancements which are not probed at run time. If you want
a generic kernel to run on all Loongson 3 machines, please say 'N'
here. If you want a high-performance kernel to run on new Loongson 3
machines only, please say 'Y' here.

Some additional explanations:
1) SFB locates between core and L1 cache, it causes memory access out
   of order, so writel/outl (and other similar functions) need a I/O
   reorder barrier.
2) Loongson 3 has a bug that di instruction can not save the irqflag,
   so arch_local_irq_save() is modified. Since CPU_MIPSR2 is selected
   by CONFIG_LOONGSON3_ENHANCEMENT, generic kernel doesn't use ei/di
   at all.
3) CPU_HAS_PREFETCH is selected by CONFIG_LOONGSON3_ENHANCEMENT, so
   MIPS_CPU_PREFETCH (used by uasm) probing is also put in this patch.
