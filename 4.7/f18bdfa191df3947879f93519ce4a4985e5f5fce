MIPS: Add defs & probing of [X]ContextConfig

The CP0_[X]ContextConfig registers are present if CP0_Config3.CTXTC or
CP0_Config3.SM are set, and provide more control over which bits of
CP0_[X]Context are set to the faulting virtual address on a TLB
exception.

KVM/VZ will need to be able to save and restore these registers in the
guest context, so add the relevant definitions and probing of the
ContextConfig feature in the root context first.
