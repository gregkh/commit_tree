debugfs: unproxify files created through debugfs_create_u32_array()

The struct file_operations u32_array_fops associated with files created
through debugfs_create_u32_array() has been lifetime aware already:
everything needed for subsequent operation is copied to a ->f_private
buffer at file opening time in u32_array_open(). Now, ->open() is always
protected against file removal issues by the debugfs core.

There is no need for the debugfs core to wrap the u32_array_fops
with a file lifetime managing proxy.

Make debugfs_create_u32_array() create its files in non-proxying operation
mode by means of debugfs_create_file_unsafe().
