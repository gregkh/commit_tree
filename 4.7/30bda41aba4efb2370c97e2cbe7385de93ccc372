powerpc/mm: Drop WIMG in favour of new constants

PowerISA 3.0 introduces two pte bits with the below meaning for radix:
  00 -> Normal Memory
  01 -> Strong Access Order (SAO)
  10 -> Non idempotent I/O (Cache inhibited and guarded)
  11 -> Tolerant I/O (Cache inhibited)

We drop the existing WIMG bits in the Linux page table in favour of the
above constants. We loose _PAGE_WRITETHRU with this conversion. We only
use writethru via pgprot_cached_wthru() which is used by
fbdev/controlfb.c which is Apple control display and also PPC32.

With respect to _PAGE_COHERENCE, we have been marking hpte always
coherent for some time now. htab_convert_pte_flags() always added
HPTE_R_M.

NOTE: KVM changes need closer review.
