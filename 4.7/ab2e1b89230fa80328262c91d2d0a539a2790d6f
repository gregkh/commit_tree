Revert "arm64: hugetlb: partial revert of 66b3923a1a0f"

This reverts commit ff7925848b50050732ac0401e0acf27e8b241d7b.

Now that the contiguous-hint hugetlb regression has been debugged and
fixed upstream by 66ee95d16a7f ("mm: exclude HugeTLB pages from THP
page_mapped() logic"), we can revert the previous partial revert of this
feature.
