coresight: etm4x: splitting struct etmv4_drvdata

Similar to what was done on etm3x, splitting driver structure
etmv4_drvdata in two.  One half is concerned with the HW
characteristics that are generally static in nature.  The other
half deals with user configuration and will change from one
trace session to another.

No gain/loss of functionality is incurred from this patch.
