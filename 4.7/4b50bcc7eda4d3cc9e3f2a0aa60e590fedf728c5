mm: use phys_addr_t for reserve_bootmem_region() arguments

Since commit 92923ca3aace ("mm: meminit: only set page reserved in the
memblock region") the reserved bit is set on reserved memblock regions.
However start and end address are passed as unsigned long.  This is only
32bit on i386, so it can end up marking the wrong pages reserved for
ranges at 4GB and above.

This was observed on a 32bit Xen dom0 which was booted with initial
memory set to a value below 4G but allowing to balloon in memory
(dom0_mem=1024M for example).  This would define a reserved bootmem
region for the additional memory (for example on a 8GB system there was
a reverved region covering the 4GB-8GB range).  But since the addresses
were passed on as unsigned long, this was actually marking all pages
from 0 to 4GB as reserved.
