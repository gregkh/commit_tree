batman-adv: Fix non-atomic bla_claim::backbone_gw access

The pointer batadv_bla_claim::backbone_gw can be changed at any time.
Therefore, access to it must be protected to ensure that two function
accessing the same backbone_gw are actually accessing the same. This is
especially important when the crc_lock is used or when the backbone_gw of a
claim is exchanged.

Not doing so leads to invalid memory access and/or reference leaks.
