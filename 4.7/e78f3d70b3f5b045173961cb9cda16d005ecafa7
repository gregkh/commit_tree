scripts/gdb: provide exception catching parser

If we attempt to read a value that is not available to GDB, an exception
is raised.  Most of the time, this is a good thing; however on occasion
we will want to be able to determine if a symbol is available.

By catching the exception to simply return None, we can determine if we
tried to read an invalid value, without the exception taking our
execution context away from us
