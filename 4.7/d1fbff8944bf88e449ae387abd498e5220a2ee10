i2c: octeon: Enable High-Level Controller

Use High-Level Controller (HLC) when possible. The HLC can read/write
up to 8 bytes and is completely optional. The most important difference
of the HLC is that it only requires one interrupt for a transfer
(up to 8 bytes) where the low-level read/write requires 2 interrupts
plus one interrupt per transferred byte. Since the interrupts are costly
using the HLC improves the performance. Also, the HLC provides improved
error handling.
