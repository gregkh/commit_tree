huge mm: move_huge_pmd does not need new_vma

Remove move_huge_pmd()'s redundant new_vma arg: all it was used for was
a VM_NOHUGEPAGE check on new_vma flags, but the new_vma is cloned from
the old vma, so a trans_huge_pmd in the new_vma will be as acceptable as
it was in the old vma, alignment and size permitting.
