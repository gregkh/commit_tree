x86/platform/uv: Disable UV BAU by default

For several years, the common practice has been to boot UVs with the
"nobau" parameter on the command line, to disable the BAU.  We've
decided that it makes more sense to just disable the BAU by default in
the kernel, and provide the option to turn it on, if desired.

For now, having the on/off switch doesn't buy us any more than just
reversing the logic would, but we're working towards having the BAU
enabled by default on UV4.  When those changes are in place, having the
on/off switch will make more sense than an enable flag, since the
default behavior will be different depending on the system version.

I've also added a bit of documentation for the new parameter to
Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt.
