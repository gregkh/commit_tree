regulator: rk808: Migrate to regulator core's simplified DT parsing code

A common simplified DT parsing code for regulators was introduced in
commit a0c7b164ad11 ("regulator: of: Provide simplified DT parsing
method")

While at it also added RK8XX_DESC and RK8XX_DESC_SWITCH macros for the
regulator_desc struct initialization. This just makes the driver more compact.
