memremap: add arch specific hook for MEMREMAP_WB mappings

Currently, the memremap code serves MEMREMAP_WB mappings directly from
the kernel direct mapping, unless the region is in high memory, in which
case it falls back to using ioremap_cache(). However, the semantics of
ioremap_cache() are not unambiguously defined, and on ARM, it will
actually result in a mapping type that differs from the attributes used
for the linear mapping, and for this reason, the ioremap_cache() call
fails if the region is part of the memory managed by the kernel.

So instead, implement an optional hook 'arch_memremap_wb' whose default
implementation calls ioremap_cache() as before, but which can be
overridden by the architecture to do what is appropriate for it.
