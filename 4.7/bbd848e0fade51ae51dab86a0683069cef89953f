block: reinstate early return of -EOPNOTSUPP from blkdev_issue_discard

Commit 38f25255330 ("block: add __blkdev_issue_discard") incorrectly
disallowed the early return of -EOPNOTSUPP if the device doesn't support
discard (or secure discard).  This early return of -EOPNOTSUPP has
always been part of blkdev_issue_discard() interface so there isn't a
good reason to break that behaviour -- especially when it can be easily
reinstated.

The nuance of allowing early return of -EOPNOTSUPP vs disallowing late
return of -EOPNOTSUPP is: if the overall device never advertised support
for discards and one is issued to the device it is beneficial to inform
the caller that discards are not supported via -EOPNOTSUPP.  But if a
device advertises discard support it means that at least a subset of the
device does have discard support -- but it could be that discards issued
to some regions of a stacked device will not be supported.  In that case
the late return of -EOPNOTSUPP must be disallowed.
