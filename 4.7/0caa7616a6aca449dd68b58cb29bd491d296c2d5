iommu/vt-d: Fix infinite loop in free_all_cpu_cached_iovas

Per VT-d spec Section 10.4.2 ("Capability Register"), the maximum
number of possible domains is 64K; indeed this is the maximum value
that the cap_ndoms() macro will expand to.  Since the value 65536
will not fix in a u16, the 'did' variable must be promoted to an
int, otherwise the test for < 65536 will always be true and the
loop will never end.

The symptom, in my case, was a hung machine during suspend.
