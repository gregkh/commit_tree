scripts/gdb: add lx_thread_info_by_pid helper

The tasks module already provides helpers to find the task struct by
pid, and the thread_info by task struct; however this is cumbersome to
utilise on the gdb commandline.

Wrap these two functionalities together in an extra single helper to
allow exploring the thread info, from a PID value
