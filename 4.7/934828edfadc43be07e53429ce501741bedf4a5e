powerpc/mm: Make 4K and 64K use pte_t for pgtable_t

This patch switches 4K Linux page size config to use pte_t * type
instead of struct page * for pgtable_t. This simplifies the code a lot
and helps in consolidating both 64K and 4K page allocator routines. The
changes should not have any impact, because we already store physical
address in the upper level page table tree and that implies we already
do struct page * to physical address conversion.

One change to note here is we move the pgtable_page_dtor() call for
nohash to pte_fragment_free_mm(). The nohash related change is due to
the related changes in pgtable_64.c.
