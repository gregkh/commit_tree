net: introduce lockdep_is_held and update various places to use it

The socket is either locked if we hold the slock spin_lock for
lock_sock_fast and unlock_sock_fast or we own the lock (sk_lock.owned
!= 0). Check for this and at the same time improve that the current
thread/cpu is really holding the lock.
