dax: Remove redundant inode size checks

Callers of dax fault handlers must make sure these calls cannot race
with truncate. Thus it is enough to check inode size when entering the
function and we don't have to recheck it again later in the handler.
Note that inode size itself can be decreased while the fault handler
runs but filesystem locking prevents against any radix tree or block
mapping information changes resulting from the truncate and that is what
we really care about.
