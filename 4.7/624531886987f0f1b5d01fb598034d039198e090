ARM: 8578/1: mm: ensure pmd_present only checks the valid bit

In a subsequent patch, pmd_mknotpresent will clear the valid bit of the
pmd entry, resulting in a not-present entry from the hardware's
perspective. Unfortunately, pmd_present simply checks for a non-zero pmd
value and will therefore continue to return true even after a
pmd_mknotpresent operation. Since pmd_mknotpresent is only used for
managing huge entries, this is only an issue for the 3-level case.

This patch fixes the 3-level pmd_present implementation to take into
account the valid bit. For bisectability, the change is made before the
fix to pmd_mknotpresent.
