IB/hfi1: Update pkey table properly after link down or FM start

When FM is disabled, and the HFI port on the switch is
changed from MgmtAllowed=YES to MgmtAllowed=NO and the
link is bounced, FULL_MGMT_P_KEY doesn't get cleared
from the pkey table. This also occurs when the QSFP
cable is moved from a switch port with MgmtAllowed=YES
to a MgmtAllowed=NO port. Clear pkey entry properly.

Also, when the driver is loaded and the switch port is
set to MgmtAllowed=NO, FULL_MGMT_P_KEY shouldn't be added
to pkey table after FM is started. Only set FULL_MGMT_P_KEY
in the pkey table if switch port is configured to
MgmtAllowed=YES.
