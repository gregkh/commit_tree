hwmon: (fam15h_power) Add compute unit accumulated power

This patch adds a member in fam15h_power_data which specifies the
compute unit accumulated power. It adds do_read_registers_on_cu to do
all the read to all MSRs and run it on one of the online cores on each
compute unit with smp_call_function_many(). This behavior can decrease
IPI numbers.
