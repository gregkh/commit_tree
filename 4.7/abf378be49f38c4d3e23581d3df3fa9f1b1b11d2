MIPS: ptrace: Prevent writes to read-only FCSR bits

Correct the cases missed with commit 9b26616c8d9d ("MIPS: Respect the
ISA level in FCSR handling") and prevent writes to read-only FCSR bits
there.

This in particular applies to FP context initialisation where any IEEE
754-2008 bits preset by `mips_set_personality_nan' are cleared before
the relevant ptrace(2) call takes effect and the PTRACE_POKEUSR request
addressing FPC_CSR where no masking of read-only FCSR bits is done.

Remove the FCSR clearing from FP context initialisation then and unify
PTRACE_POKEUSR/FPC_CSR and PTRACE_SETFPREGS handling, by factoring out
code from `ptrace_setfpregs' and calling it from both places.

This mostly matters to soft float configurations where the emulator can
be switched this way to a mode which should not be accessible and cannot
be set with the CTC1 instruction.  With hard float configurations any
effect is transient anyway as read-only bits will retain their values at
the time the FP context is restored.
