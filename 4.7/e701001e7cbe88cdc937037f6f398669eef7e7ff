netfilter: nft_rbtree: allow adjacent intervals with dynamic updates

This patch fixes dynamic element updates for adjacent intervals in the
rb-tree representation.

Since elements are sorted in the rb-tree, in case of adjacent nodes with
the same key, the assumption is that an interval end node must be placed
before an interval opening.

In tree lookup operations, the idea is to search for the closer element
that is smaller than the one we're searching for. Given that we'll have
two possible matchings, we have to take the opening interval in case of
adjacent nodes.

Range merges are not trivial with the current representation,
specifically we have to check if node extensions are equal and make sure
we keep the existing internal states around.
