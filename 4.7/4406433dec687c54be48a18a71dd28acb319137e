mmc: sdhci-of-at91: add presets setup

The controller claims to support SDR104. In fact, it only supports a
degraded SDR104 since the maximum frequency of the SD clock is 120 MHz
instead of 208 MHz.
The sdhci core is unaware of it and will compute a wrong clock divider.
We can deal with this specific case by using presets.
