usb: gadged: pch_udc: get rid of redundant assignments

It seems there are leftovers of some assignments which are not used
anymore.  Compiler even warns us about:

drivers/usb/gadget/udc/pch_udc.c:2022:22: warning: variable ‘dev’ set \
but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

drivers/usb/gadget/udc/pch_udc.c:2639:9: warning: variable ‘ret’ set \
but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

Remove them and shut compiler about.
