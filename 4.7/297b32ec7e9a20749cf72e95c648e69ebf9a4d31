drm/i915: Ignore GTFIFODBG FIFO free entry fields on CHV

On CHV GTFIFODBG has some read-only bits to indicate the number
of free FIFO entries. Ignore these when checking to see if any
of the sticky error bits are set.

This gets rid of these during device resume:
[drm:cherryview_enable_rps] GT fifo had a previous error 1080000

While at it, move the assignments out of the if().
