ideapad-laptop: add a new WMI string for ESC key

My patch to the ideapad-laptop driver to get the ESC key working on the
Yoga 1170 (Yoga 3) failed to do the same for the following model, the
Lenovo Yoga 700.

Denis Gordienko managed to get it working by adding another GUID for the
new WMI interface. I have adapted his patch to normal coding style
and simplified it a bit for inclusion, but this patch is currently
untested.
