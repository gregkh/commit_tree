sparc: get rid of superfluous __GFP_REPEAT

__GFP_REPEAT has a rather weak semantic but since it has been introduced
around 2.6.12 it has been ignored for low order allocations.

{pud,pmd}_alloc_one is using __GFP_REPEAT but it always allocates from
pgtable_cache which is initialzed to PAGE_SIZE objects.  This means that
this flag has never been actually useful here because it has always been
used only for PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY requests.
