dmaengine: dw: fix byte order of hw descriptor fields

If the DMA controller uses a different byte order than the host CPU,
the hardware linked list descriptor fields need to be byte-swapped.

This patch makes the driver write these fields using the same byte
order it uses for mmio accesses to the DMA engine. I do not know
if this is guaranteed to always be correct.
