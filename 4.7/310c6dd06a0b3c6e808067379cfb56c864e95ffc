scripts/decode_stacktrace.sh: handle symbols in modules

scripts/decode_stacktrace.sh presently displays module symbols as

	func+0x0ff/0x5153 [module]

Add a third argument: the pathname of a directory where the script
should look for the file module.ko so that the output appears as

	func (foo/bar.c:123) module

Without the argument or if the module file isn't found the script prints
such symbols as is without decoding.
