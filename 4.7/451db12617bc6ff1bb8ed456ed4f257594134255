perf tools: Refactor code to move call path handling out of thread-stack

Move the call path handling code out of thread-stack.c and
thread-stack.h to allow other components that are not part of
thread-stack to create call paths.

Summary:

- Create call-path.c and call-path.h and add them to the build.

- Move all call path related code out of thread-stack.c and thread-stack.h
  and into call-path.c and call-path.h.

- A small subset of structures and functions are now visible through
  call-path.h, which is required for thread-stack.c to continue to
  compile.

This change is a prerequisite for subsequent patches in this change set
and by itself contains no user-visible changes.
