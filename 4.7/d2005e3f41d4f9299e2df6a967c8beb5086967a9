userfaultfd: don't pin the user memory in userfaultfd_file_create()

userfaultfd_file_create() increments mm->mm_users; this means that the
memory won't be unmapped/freed if mm owner exits/execs, and UFFDIO_COPY
after that can populate the orphaned mm more.

Change userfaultfd_file_create() and userfaultfd_ctx_put() to use
mm->mm_count to pin mm_struct.  This means that
atomic_inc_not_zero(mm->mm_users) is needed when we are going to
actually play with this memory.  Except handle_userfault() path doesn't
need this, the caller must already have a reference.

The patch adds the new trivial helper, mmget_not_zero(), it can have
more users.
