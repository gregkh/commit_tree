staging: unisys: removed unused switch/port info from visorbus.h

The fields 'switch_no' and 'internal_port_no' were originally added to the
visor_device struct in preparation of removing the 'device_info' struct
in the now removed 'uislib' library. After the refactoring was complete,
these attributes are not referenced anywhere, and there are no plans to
use them.
