samples/bpf: allow make to be run from samples/bpf/ directory

It is not intuitive that 'make' must be run from the top level
directory with argument "samples/bpf/" to compile these eBPF samples.

Introduce a kbuild make file trick that allow make to be run from the
"samples/bpf/" directory itself.  It basically change to the top level
directory and call "make samples/bpf/" with the "/" slash after the
directory name.

Also add a clean target that only cleans this directory, by taking
advantage of the kbuild external module setting M=$PWD.
