MIPS: Add defs & probing of BadInstr[P] registers

The optional CP0_BadInstr and CP0_BadInstrP registers are written with
the encoding of the instruction that caused a synchronous exception to
occur, and the prior branch instruction if in a delay slot.

These will be useful for instruction emulation in KVM, and especially
for VZ support where reading guest virtual memory is a bit more awkward.

Add CPU option numbers and cpu_has_* definitions to indicate the
presence of each registers, and add code to probe for them using bits in
the CP0_Config3 register.
