ixgbe: napi_poll must return the work done

Currently the function ixgbe_poll() returns 0 when it clean completely
the rx rings, but this foul budget accounting in core code.
Fix this returning the actual work done, capped to weight - 1, since
the core doesn't allow to return the full budget when the driver modifies
the napi status
