ila: add checksum neutral ILA translations

Support checksum neutral ILA as described in the ILA draft. The low
order 16 bits of the identifier are used to contain the checksum
adjustment value.

The csum-mode parameter is added to described checksum processing. There
are three values:
 - adjust transport checksum (previous behavior)
 - do checksum neutral mapping
 - do nothing

On output the csum-mode in the ila_params is checked and acted on. If
mode is checksum neutral mapping then to mapping and set C-bit.

On input, C-bit is checked. If it is set checksum-netural mapping is
done (regardless of csum-mode in ila params) and C-bit will be cleared.
If it is not set then action in csum-mode is taken.
