tun: use per cpu variables for stats accounting

Currently the tun device accounting uses dev->stats without applying any
kind of protection, regardless that accounting happens in preemptible
process context.
This patch move the tun stats to a per cpu data structure, and protect
the updates with  u64_stats_update_begin()/u64_stats_update_end() or
this_cpu_inc according to the stat type. The per cpu stats are
aggregated by the newly added ndo_get_stats64 ops.
