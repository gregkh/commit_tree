drm/i915: Only ignore eDP ports that are connected

If the VBT says that a certain port should be eDP (and hence fused off
from HDMI), but in reality it isn't, we need to try and acquire the HDMI
connection instead. So only trust the VBT edp setting if we can connect
to an eDP device on that port.

Fixes: d2182a6608 (drm/i915: Don't register HDMI connectors for eDP ports on VLV/CHV)
