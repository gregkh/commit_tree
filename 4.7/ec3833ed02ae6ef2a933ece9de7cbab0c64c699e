rcu: Force boolean subscript for expedited stall warnings

The cpu_online() function can return values other than 0 and 1, which
can result in subscript overflow when applied to a two-element array.
This commit allows for this behavior by using "!!" on the return value
from cpu_online() when used as a subscript.
