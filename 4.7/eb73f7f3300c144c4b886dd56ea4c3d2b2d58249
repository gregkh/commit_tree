radix-tree: add test for radix_tree_locate_item()

Add a unit test that provides coverage for the bug fixed in the commit
entitled "radix-tree: rewrite radix_tree_locate_item fix" from Hugh
Dickins.  I've verified that this test fails before his patch due to
miscalculated 'index' values in __locate() in lib/radix-tree.c, and
passes with his fix.
