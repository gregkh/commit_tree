hpsa: Fix type ZBC conditional checks

The device ID obtained from the inquiry can only be of a single type.
The original code places a check for TYPE_ZBC right after the check for
TYPE_DISK. Logically, if the first if statement sees a device of a
TYPE_DISK and moves on to the second statement checking if not TYPE_ZBC,
it will always hit the continue.
