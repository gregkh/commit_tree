drm/i915: Determine DP++ type 1 DVI adaptor presence based on VBT

DP dual mode type 1 DVI adaptors aren't required to implement any
registers, so it's a bit hard to detect them. The best way would
be to check the state of the CONFIG1 pin, but we have no way to
do that. So as a last resort, check the VBT to see if the HDMI
port is in fact a dual mode capable DP port.

v2: Deal with VBT code reorganization
    Deal with DRM_DP_DUAL_MODE_UNKNOWN
    Reduce DEVICE_TYPE_DP_DUAL_MODE_BITS a bit
    Accept both DP and HDMI dvo_port in VBT as my BSW
    at least declare its DP port as HDMI :(
v3: Ignore DEVICE_TYPE_NOT_HDMI_OUTPUT (Shashank)
