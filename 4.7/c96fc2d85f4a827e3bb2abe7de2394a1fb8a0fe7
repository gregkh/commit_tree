signal: make oom_flags a bool

Currently the size of "struct signal_struct"->oom_flags member is
sizeof(unsigned) bytes, but only one flag OOM_FLAG_ORIGIN which is
updated by current thread is defined.  We can convert OOM_FLAG_ORIGIN
into a bool, and reuse the saved bytes for updating from the OOM killer
and/or the OOM reaper thread.

By the way, do we care about a race window between run_store() and
swapoff() because it would be theoretically possible that two threads
sharing the "struct signal_struct" concurrently call respective
functions? If we care, we can make oom_flags an atomic_t.
