netfilter: conntrack: use a single hashtable for all namespaces

We already include netns address in the hash and compare the netns pointers
during lookup, so even if namespaces have overlapping addresses entries
will be spread across the table.

Assuming 64k bucket size, this change saves 0.5 mbyte per namespace on a
64bit system.

NAT bysrc and expectation hash is still per namespace, those will
changed too soon.

Future patch will also make conntrack object slab cache global again.
