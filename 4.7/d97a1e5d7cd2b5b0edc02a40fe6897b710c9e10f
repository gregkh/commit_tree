mmc: pwrseq: convert to proper platform device

simple-pwrseq and emmc-pwrseq drivers rely on platform_device
structure from of_find_device_by_node(), this works mostly. But, as there
is no driver associated with this devices, cases like default/init pinctrl
setup would never be performed by pwrseq. This becomes problem when the
gpios used in pwrseq require pinctrl setup.

Currently most of the common pinctrl setup is done in
drivers/base/pinctrl.c by pinctrl_bind_pins().

There are two ways to solve this issue on either convert pwrseq drivers
to a proper platform drivers or copy the exact code from
pcintrl_bind_pins(). I prefer converting pwrseq to proper drivers so that
other cases like setting up clks/parents from dt would also be possible.
