cpufreq: schedutil: Improve prints messages with pr_fmt

Prefix print messages with KBUILD_MODNAME, i.e 'cpufreq_schedutil: '.
This helps to keep similar formatting for all the print messages
particular to a file and identify those easily in kernel logs.

Its already done this way for rest of the governors.

Along with that, remove the (now) redundant bits from a print message.
