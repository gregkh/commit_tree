powerpc/eeh: Fix wrong argument passed to eeh_rmv_device()

When calling eeh_rmv_device() in eeh_reset_device() for partial hotplug
case, @rmv_data instead of its address is the proper argument.
Otherwise, the stack frame is corrupted when writing to
@rmv_data (actually its address) in eeh_rmv_device(). It results in
kernel crash as observed.

This fixes the issue by passing @rmv_data, not its address to
eeh_rmv_device() in eeh_reset_device().
