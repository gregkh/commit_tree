iommu/arm-smmu: Work around MMU-500 prefetch errata

MMU-500 erratum #841119 is tickled by a particular set of circumstances
interacting with the next-page prefetcher. Since said prefetcher is
quite dumb and actually detrimental to performance in some cases (by
causing unwanted TLB evictions for non-sequential access patterns), we
lose very little by turning it off, and what we gain is a guarantee that
the erratum is never hit.

As a bonus, the same workaround will also prevent erratum #826419 once
v7 short descriptor support is implemented.
