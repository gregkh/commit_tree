ASoC: da7213: Add checking of SRM lock status before enabling DAI

When the codec is DAI clk slave, and the SRM feature of the PLL
is being used, the enabling of the DAI should occur only after
the PLL has locked to the incoming WCLK. This update adds checking
to the the DAI widget event, so it waits for SRM to lock. There is
also a timeout if that lock doesn't occur within a given time.
