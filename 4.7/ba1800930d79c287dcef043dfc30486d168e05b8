dt-bindings: Correct path for ARM GIC documentation

Commit eb3fcf007fff ("dt-bindings: consolidate interrupt controller
bindings") moved the binding documentation for the ARM GIC from
arm/gic.txt to interrupt-controller/arm,gic.txt. However, there are
still some binding documents referring to the old path. Update these
binding documents to use the correct location.

Fixes: eb3fcf007fff ("dt-bindings: consolidate interrupt controller bindings")
