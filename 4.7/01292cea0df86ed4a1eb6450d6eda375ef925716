genirq: Make irq_destroy_ipi take a cpumask of IPIs to destroy

Previously irq_destroy_ipi() would destroy IPIs to all CPUs that were
configured by irq_reserve_ipi(). This change makes it possible to
destroy just a subset of the IPIs. This may be useful to remove IPIs to
CPUs that have been hot removed so that the IRQ numbers allocated within
the IPI domain can be re-used.

The original behaviour is restored by passing the complete mask that the
IPI was created with.

There are currently no users of this function that would break from the
API change.
