qla2xxx: Remove use of 'struct timeval'

struct register_host_info stores a 64-bit UTC system time timestamp.
This patch removes the use of 'struct timeval' to obtain that timestamp
as its tv_sec value will overflow on 32-bit systems in year 2038 beyond.
The patch uses ktime_get_real_seconds() which returns a 64-bit seconds value.
