sh: get rid of superfluous __GFP_REPEAT

__GFP_REPEAT has a rather weak semantic but since it has been introduced
around 2.6.12 it has been ignored for low order allocations.

PGALLOC_GFP uses __GFP_REPEAT but {pgd,pmd}_alloc allocate from
{pgd,pmd}_cache but both caches are allocating up to PAGE_SIZE objects.
This means that this flag has never been actually useful here because it
has always been used only for PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY requests.
