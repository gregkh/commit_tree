53c700: fix BUG on untagged commands

The untagged command case in the 53c700 driver has been broken since
host wide tags were enabled because the replaced scsi_find_tag()
function had a special case for the tag value SCSI_NO_TAG to retrieve
sdev->current_cmnd.  The replacement function scsi_host_find_tag() has
no such special case and returns NULL causing untagged commands to
trigger a BUG() in the driver.  Inspection shows that the 53c700 is the
only driver using this SCSI_NO_TAG case, so a local fix in the driver
suffices to fix this problem globally.
