ubifs: Switch to generic xattr handlers

Ubifs internally uses special inodes for storing xattrs. Those inodes
had NULL {get,set,remove}xattr inode operations before this change, so
xattr operations on them would fail. The super block's s_xattr field
would also apply to those special inodes. However, the inodes are not
visible outside of ubifs, and so no xattr operations will ever be
carried out on them anyway.
