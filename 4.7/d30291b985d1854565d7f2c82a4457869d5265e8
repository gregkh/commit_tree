libceph: variable-sized ceph_object_id

Currently ceph_object_id can hold object names of up to 100
(CEPH_MAX_OID_NAME_LEN) characters.  This is enough for all use cases,
expect one - long rbd image names:

- a format 1 header is named "<imgname>.rbd"
- an object that points to a format 2 header is named "rbd_id.<imgname>"

We operate on these potentially long-named objects during rbd map, and,
for format 1 images, during header refresh.  (A format 2 header name is
a small system-generated string.)

Lift this 100 character limit by making ceph_object_id be able to point
to an externally-allocated string.  Apart from being able to work with
almost arbitrarily-long named objects, this allows us to reduce the
size of ceph_object_id from >100 bytes to 64 bytes.
