taskstats: use the libnl API to align nlattr on 64-bit

Goal of this patch is to use the new libnl API to align netlink attribute
when needed.
The layout of the netlink message will be a bit different after the patch,
because the padattr (TASKSTATS_TYPE_STATS) will be inside the nested
attribute instead of before it.
