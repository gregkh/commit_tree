target: make target db location configurable

This commit adds the read-write attribute "dbroot",
in the top-level CONFIGFS (core) target directory,
normally /sys/kernel/config/target. This attribute
defaults to "/var/target" but can be changed by
writing a new pathname string to it. Changing this
attribute is only allowed when no fabric drivers
are loaded and the supplied value specifies an
existing directory.

Target modules that care about the target database
root directory will be modified to use this
attribute in a future commit.
