aacraid: Fix for KDUMP driver hang

When KDUMP is triggered the driver first talks to the firmware in INTX
mode, but the adapter firmware is still in MSIX mode. Therefore the first
driver command hangs since the driver is waiting for an INTX response and
firmware gives a MSIX response. If when the OS is installed on a RAID
drive created by the adapter KDUMP will hang since the driver does not
receive a response in sync mode.

Fixed by: Change the firmware to INTX mode if it is in MSIX mode before
sending the first sync command.
