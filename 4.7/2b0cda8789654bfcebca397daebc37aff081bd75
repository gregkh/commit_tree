KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: Add CTLR, TYPER and IIDR handlers

Those three registers are v2 emulation specific, so their implementation
lives entirely in vgic-mmio-v2.c. Also they are handled in one function,
as their implementation is pretty simple.
When the guest enables the distributor, we kick all VCPUs to get
potentially pending interrupts serviced.
