perf script: Fix callchain addresses in db-export

Remove the call to map_ip() to adjust al.addr, because it has already
been called when assembling the callchain, in:

  thread__resolve_callchain_sample(perf_sample)
      add_callchain_ip(ip = perf_sample->callchain->ips[j])
          thread__find_addr_location(addr = ip)
              thread__find_addr_map(addr) {
                  al->addr = addr
                  if (al->map)
                      al->addr = al->map->map_ip(al->map, al->addr);
              }

Calling it a second time can result in incorrect addresses being used.
This can have effects such as duplicate symbols being created and
exported.
