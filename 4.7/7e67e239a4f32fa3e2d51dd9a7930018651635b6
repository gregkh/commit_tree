cpufreq: dt: Include types.h from cpufreq-dt.h

cpufreq-dt.h uses 'bool' data type but doesn't include types.h. It works
fine for now as the files that include cpufreq-dt.h, also include
types.h directly or indirectly.

But, when a file includes cpufreq-dt.h without including types.h, we get
a build error. Avoid such errors by including types.h in cpufreq-dt
itself.
