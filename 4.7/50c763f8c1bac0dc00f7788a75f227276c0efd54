usb: dwc3: Set the ClearPendIN bit on Clear Stall EP command

As of core revision 2.60a the recommended programming model is to set
the ClearPendIN bit when issuing a Clear Stall EP command for IN
endpoints. This is to prevent an issue where some (non-compliant) hosts
may not send ACK TPs for pending IN transfers due to a mishandled error
condition. Synopsys STAR 9000614252.
