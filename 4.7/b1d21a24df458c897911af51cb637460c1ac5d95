regulator: qcom_spmi: Always return a selector when asked

I had a thinko in spmi_regulator_select_voltage_same_range() when
converting it to return selectors via the function's return value
instead of by modifying a pointer argument. I only tested
multi-range regulators so this passed through testing. Fix it by
returning the selector here.
