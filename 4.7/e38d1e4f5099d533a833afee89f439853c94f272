IB/hfi1: Check P_KEY for all sent packets from user mode

Add the P_KEY check for user-context mechanism for
both PIO and SDMA. For PIO, the
SendCtxtCheckEnable.DisallowKDETHPackets is set by
default. When the P_KEY is set,
SendCtxtCheckEnable.DisallowKDETHPackets is cleared.
For SDMA, a software check was included. This change
requires user processes to set the P_KEY before sending
any packets, otherwise, the sent packet will fail. The
original submission didn't have this check but it's
required.
