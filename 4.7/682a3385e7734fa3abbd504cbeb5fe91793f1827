mm, page_alloc: inline the fast path of the zonelist iterator

The page allocator iterates through a zonelist for zones that match the
addressing limitations and nodemask of the caller but many allocations
will not be restricted.  Despite this, there is always functional call
overhead which builds up.

This patch inlines the optimistic basic case and only calls the iterator
function for the complex case.  A hindrance was the fact that
cpuset_current_mems_allowed is used in the fastpath as the allowed
nodemask even though all nodes are allowed on most systems.  The patch
handles this by only considering cpuset_current_mems_allowed if a cpuset
exists.  As well as being faster in the fast-path, this removes some
junk in the slowpath.

The performance difference on a page allocator microbenchmark is;

perf indicated that next_zones_zonelist disappeared in the profile and
__next_zones_zonelist did not appear.  This is expected as the
micro-benchmark would hit the inlined fast-path every time.
