x86/perf/intel/cstate: Make cstate hotplug handling actually work

The current implementation aside of being an incomprehensible mess is broken.

  # cat /sys/bus/event_source/devices/cstate_core/cpumask
  0-17

That's on a quad socket machine with 72 physical cores! Qualitee stuff.

So it's not a surprise that event migration in case of CPU hotplug does not
work either.

  # perf stat -e cstate_core/c6-residency/ -C 1 sleep 60 &
  # echo 0 >/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online

Tracing cstate_pmu_event_update gives me:

 [001] cstate_pmu_event_update <-event_sched_out

After the fix it properly moves the event:

 [001] cstate_pmu_event_update <-event_sched_out
 [073] cstate_pmu_event_update <-__perf_event_read
 [073] cstate_pmu_event_update <-event_sched_out

The migration of pkg events does not work either. Not that I'm surprised.

I really could not be bothered to decode that loop mess and simply replaced it
by querying the proper cpumasks which give us the answer in a comprehensible
way.

This also requires to direct the event to the current active reader CPU in
cstate_pmu_event_init() otherwise the hotplug logic can't work.
