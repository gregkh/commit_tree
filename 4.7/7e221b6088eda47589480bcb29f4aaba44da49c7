staging: lustre: lnet: revert commit 4671a0266

Commit 4671a0266 change the parameter of the second parameter of
cfs_precpt_alloc() from a sizeof type to sizeof type *pointer.
This was incorrect in this case and it caused a crash when the LNet
layer was brought up in my testing. The reason is cfs_precpt_alloc()
creates an array of items where the arrays size is equal to the
number of CPTs that exist. Changing to type *pointer only had
cfs_precpt_alloc() create an array of pointers instead of an array
of actual data structures. This patch reverse this change and adds
comments to explain what cfs_precpt_alloc() is actually doing to
avoid potential issues like this again.

Changelog:

v1) Simple revert of the original patch

v2) Added in comments to explain why cfs_precpt_alloc() has the
    arguments it uses.
