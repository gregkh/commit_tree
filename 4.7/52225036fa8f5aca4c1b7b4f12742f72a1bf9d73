perf hists: Move sort__need_collapse into struct perf_hpp_list

Now we have sort dimensions private for struct hists, we need to make
dimension booleans hists specific as well.

Moving sort__need_collapse into struct perf_hpp_list.

Adding hists__has macro to easily access this info perf struct hists
object.
