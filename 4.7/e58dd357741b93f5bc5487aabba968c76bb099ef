usb: dwc3: add disable receiver detection in P3 quirk

Some freescale QorIQ platforms require to disable receiver detection
in P3 for correct detection of USB devices. If GUSB3PIPECTL(DISRXDETINP3)
is set, Core will change PHY power state to P2 and then perform receiver
detection. After receiver detection, Core will change PHY power state to
P3. Same quirk would be added in dts file in future patches.
