bpf, samples: don't zero data when not needed

Remove the zero initialization in the sample programs where appropriate.
Note that this is an optimization which is now possible, old programs
still doing the zero initialization are just fine as well. Also, make
sure we don't have padding issues when we don't memset() the entire
struct anymore.
