netfilter: fix IS_ERR_VALUE usage

This is a forward-port of the original patch from Andrzej Hajda,
he said:

"IS_ERR_VALUE should be used only with unsigned long type.
Otherwise it can work incorrectly. To achieve this function
xt_percpu_counter_alloc is modified to return unsigned long,
and its result is assigned to temporary variable to perform
error checking, before assigning to .pcnt field.

The patch follows conclusion from discussion on LKML [1][2].
