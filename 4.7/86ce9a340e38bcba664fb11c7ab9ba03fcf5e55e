mips: mt7620: fallback to SDRAM when syscfg0 does not have a valid value for the memory type

Mediatek MT7620 SoC has syscfg0 bits where it sets the type of memory being used.
However, sometimes those bits are not set properly (reading "11"). In this case, the SoC assumes SDRAM.
The patch below reflects that.
