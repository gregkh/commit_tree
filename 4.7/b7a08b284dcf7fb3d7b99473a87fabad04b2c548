iwlwifi: pcie: extend device reset delay

Newer hardware generations will take longer to be accessible again
after reset, so we need to wait longer before continuing any flow
that did a reset.

Rather than make the wait time configurable, simply extend it for
all.

Since all of these code paths can sleep, use usleep_range() rather
than mdelay().
