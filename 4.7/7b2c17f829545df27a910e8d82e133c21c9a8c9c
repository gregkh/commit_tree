usb: musb: Stop bulk endpoint while queue is rotated

Ensure that the endpoint is stopped by clearing REQPKT before
clearing DATAERR_NAKTIMEOUT before rotating the queue on the
dedicated bulk endpoint.
This addresses an issue where a race could result in the endpoint
receiving data before it was reprogrammed resulting in a warning
about such data from musb_rx_reinit before it was thrown away.
The data thrown away was a valid packet that had been correctly
ACKed which meant the host and device got out of sync.
