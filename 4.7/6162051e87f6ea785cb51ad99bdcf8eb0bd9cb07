MIPS: math-emu: Unify ieee754sp_m{add,sub}f

The code for emulating MIPSr6 madd.s & msub.s instructions has
previously been implemented as 2 different functions, namely
ieee754sp_maddf & ieee754sp_msubf. The difference in behaviour of these
2 instructions is merely the sign of the product, so we can easily share
the code implementing them. Do this for the single precision variant,
removing the original ieee754sp_msubf in favor of reusing the code from
ieee754sp_maddf.
