aacraid: Remove code to needlessly complete fib

Currently driver completes double completed or spurious interrupted fibs.
This  is not necessary and causes the SCSI mid layer to issue aborts and
resets, since completing a fib  prematurely might trigger a race condition
resulting in the driver not calling the scsi_done callback.

Fixed by removing the call to fib complete.
