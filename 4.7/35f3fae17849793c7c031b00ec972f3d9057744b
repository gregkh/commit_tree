kvm: robustify steal time record

Guest should only trust data to be valid when version haven't changed
before and after reads of steal time. Besides not changing, it has to
be an even number. Hypervisor may write an odd number to version field
to indicate that an update is in progress.

kvm_steal_clock() in guest has already done the read side, make write
side in hypervisor more robust by following the above rule.
