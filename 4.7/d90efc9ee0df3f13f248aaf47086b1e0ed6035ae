drm/exynos: dp: Fix NULL pointer dereference due uninitialized connector

Commit 3424e3a4f844 ("drm: bridge: analogix/dp: split exynos dp driver to
bridge directory") split the Exynos DP core driver into a core driver and
a bridge driver for the Analogix chip since that is also used by Rockchip.

But the change introduced a regression causing a NULL pointer dereference
when trying to access an uninitialized connector in the driver .get_modes:

Fix this by instead of having a connector struct for both the Exynos and
Analogix drivers, just use the connector initialized in the bridge driver.

Fixes: 3424e3a4f844 ("drm: bridge: analogix/dp: split exynos dp driver to bridge directory")
