perf machine: Do not bail out if not managing to read ref reloc symbol

This means the user can't access /proc/kallsyms, for instance, because
/proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict is set to 1.

Instead leave the ref_reloc_sym as NULL and code using it will cope.

This allows 'perf trace' to work on such systems for !root, the only
issue would be when trying to resolve kernel symbols, which happens,
for instance, in some libtracevent plugins.  A warning for that case
will be provided in the next patch in this series.

Noticed in Ubuntu 16.04, that comes with kptr_restrict=1.
