tun: use socket locks for sk_{attach,detatch}_filter

This reverts commit 5a5abb1fa3b05dd ("tun, bpf: fix suspicious RCU usage
in tun_{attach, detach}_filter") and replaces it to use lock_sock around
sk_{attach,detach}_filter. The checks inside filter.c are updated with
lockdep_sock_is_held to check for proper socket locks.

It keeps the code cleaner by ensuring that only one lock governs the
socket filter instead of two independent locks.
