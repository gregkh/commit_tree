drm/i915: Refer to GGTT {,VM} consistently

Refer to the GGTT VM consistently as "ggtt->base" instead of just "ggtt",
"vm" or indirectly through other variables like "dev_priv->ggtt.base"
to avoid confusion with the i915_ggtt object itself and PPGTT VMs.

Refer to the GGTT as "ggtt" instead of indirectly through chaining.

As a bonus gets rid of the long-standing i915_obj_to_ggtt vs.
i915_gem_obj_to_ggtt conflict, due to removal of i915_obj_to_ggtt!

v2:
- Added some more after grepping sources with Chris

v3:
- Refer to GGTT VM through ggtt->base consistently instead of ggtt_vm
  (Chris)

v4:
- Convert all dev_priv->ggtt->foo accesses to ggtt->foo.

v5:
- Make patch checker happy
