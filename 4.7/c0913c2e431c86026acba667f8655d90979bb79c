i40evf: Don't Panic

Under some circumstances the driver remove function may be called before
the driver is fully initialized. So we can't assume that we know where
our towel is at, or that all of the data structures are initialized.

To ensure that we don't panic, check that the vsi_res pointer is valid
before dereferencing it. Then drink beer and eat peanuts.
