net-rfs: fix false sharing accessing sd->input_queue_head

sd->input_queue_head is incremented for each processed packet
in process_backlog(), and read from other cpus performing
Out Of Order avoidance in get_rps_cpu()

Moving this field in a separate cache line keeps it mostly
hot for the cpu in process_backlog(), as other cpus will
only read it.

In a stress test, process_backlog() was consuming 6.80 % of cpu cycles,
and the patch reduced the cost to 0.65 %
