btrfs: s_bdev is not null after missing replace

Yauhen reported in the ML that s_bdev is null at mount, and
s_bdev gets updated to some device when missing device is
replaced, as because bdev is null for missing device, things
gets matched up. Fix this by checking if s_bdev is set. I
didn't want to completely remove updating s_bdev because
the future multi device support at vfs layer may need it.
