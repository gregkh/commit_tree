xfs: mute some sparse warnings

These three warnings are fixed:

fs/xfs/xfs_inode.c:1033:44: warning: Using plain integer as NULL pointer
fs/xfs/xfs_inode_item.c:525:20: warning: context imbalance in 'xfs_inode_item_push' - unexpected unlock
fs/xfs/xfs_dquot.c:696:1: warning: symbol 'xfs_dq_get_next_id' was not declared. Should it be static?
