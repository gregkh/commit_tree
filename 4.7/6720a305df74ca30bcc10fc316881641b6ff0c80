locking: avoid passing around 'thread_info' in mutex debugging code

None of the code actually wants a thread_info, it all wants a
task_struct, and it's just converting back and forth between the two
("ti->task" to get the task_struct from the thread_info, and
"task_thread_info(task)" to go the other way).

No semantic change.
