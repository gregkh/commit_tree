mm, meminit: ensure node is online before checking whether pages are uninitialised

early_page_uninitialised looks up an arbitrary PFN.  While a machine
without node 0 will boot with "mm, page_alloc: Always return a valid
node from early_pfn_to_nid", it works because it assumes that nodes are
always in PFN order.  This is not guaranteed so this patch adds
robustness by always checking if the node being checked is online.
