clk: pwm: Use pwm_get_args() where appropriate

The PWM framework has clarified the concept of reference PWM config (the
platform dependent config retrieved from the DT or the PWM lookup table)
and real PWM state.

Use pwm_get_args() when the PWM user wants to retrieve this reference
config and not the current state.

This is part of the rework allowing the PWM framework to support
hardware readout and expose real PWM state even when the PWM has just
been requested (before the user calls pwm_config/enable/disable()).
