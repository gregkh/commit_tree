gpio: mcp23s08: Add support for level triggered interrupts

The interrupt for the corresponding pin is configured to trigger when the
pin state changes compared to a preconfigured state (Bit set in INTCON).
This state is set by setting/clearing the bit in DEFVAL.
In the interrupt handler we need also to check if the bit in INTCON is set
for level triggered interrupts.
