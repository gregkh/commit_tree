bpf, verifier: add bpf_call_arg_meta for passing meta data

Currently, when the verifier checks calls in check_call() function, we
call check_func_arg() for all 5 arguments e.g. to make sure expected types
are correct. In some cases, we collect meta data (here: map pointer) to
perform additional checks such as checking stack boundary on key/value
sizes for subsequent arguments. As we're going to extend the meta data,
add a generic struct bpf_call_arg_meta that we can use for passing into
check_func_arg().
