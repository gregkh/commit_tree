Drivers: hv: vmbus: Implement APIs to support "in place" consumption of vmbus packets

Implement APIs for in-place consumption of vmbus packets. Currently, each
packet is copied and processed one at a time and as part of processing
each packet we potentially may signal the host (if it is waiting for
room to produce a packet).

These APIs help batched in-place processing of vmbus packets.
We also optimize host signaling by having a separate API to signal
the end of in-place consumption. With netvsc using these APIs,
on an iperf run on average I see about 20X reduction in checks to
signal the host.
