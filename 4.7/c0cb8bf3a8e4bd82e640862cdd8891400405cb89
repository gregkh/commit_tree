sunrpc: fix stripping of padded MIC tokens

The length of the GSS MIC token need not be a multiple of four bytes.
It is then padded by XDR to a multiple of 4 B, but unwrap_integ_data()
would previously only trim mic.len + 4 B. The remaining up to three
bytes would then trigger a check in nfs4svc_decode_compoundargs(),
leading to a "garbage args" error and mount failure:

nfs4svc_decode_compoundargs: compound not properly padded!
nfsd: failed to decode arguments!

This would prevent older clients using the pre-RFC 4121 MIC format
(37-byte MIC including a 9-byte OID) from mounting exports from v3.9+
servers using krb5i.

The trimming was introduced by commit 4c190e2f913f ("sunrpc: trim off
trailing checksum before returning decrypted or integrity authenticated
buffer").
