       drm/i915/bxt: don't allow cached GEM mappings on A stepping

Added an exception of disallowing snooping for Broxton A
stepping hardware but userptr was still enabling it regardless.

Move the check to HAS_SNOOP now that it is used from multiple
call sites and use it.

v2: Userptr cannot be supported when it cannot be coherent and
    generalize the code better. (Chris Wilson)

v3: Make has_snoop true only when !has_llc. (Chris Wilson)
