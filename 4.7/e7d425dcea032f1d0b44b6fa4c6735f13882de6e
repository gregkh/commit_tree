net: mediatek: fix mtk_pending_work

The driver supports 2 MACs. Both run on the same DMA ring. If we hit a TX
timeout we need to stop both netdevs before restarting them again. If we
don't do this, mtk_stop() wont shutdown DMA and the consecutive call to
mtk_open() wont restart DMA and enable IRQs.
