phy: marvell: fix LED configuration via marvell,reg-init

Configuring the PHY LED registers for the Marvell 88E1510 and others is
not possible, because regardless of the values in marvell,reg-init, it
is later overridden in m88e1121_config_aneg with a non-standard default.

This patch moves that default configuration to .config_init to allow
setting the LED configuration through marvell,reg-init in the device
tree, which should override said default if it exists.
