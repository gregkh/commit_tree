ASoC: rockchip: Revert "ASoC: rockchip: i2s: separate capture and playback"

This reverts commit eba65d179c1149cf79e68608d452631f33d7f017.

This broke audio on Veyron Jerry Chromebooks and I now cannot reproduce
the problem I was trying to fix even with this commit reverted, so it
seems that this was completely the wrong thing to do.
