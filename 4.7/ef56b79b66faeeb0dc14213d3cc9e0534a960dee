clk: fix critical clock locking

The critical clock handling in __clk_core_init isn't taking the enable lock
before calling clk_core_enable, which in turns triggers the warning in the
lockdep_assert_held call in that function when lockep is enabled.

Add the calls to clk_enable_lock/unlock to make sure it doesn't happen.
