MIPS: cevt-r4k: Dynamically calculate min_delta_ns

Calculate the MIPS clockevent device's min_delta_ns dynamically based on
the time it takes to perform the mips_next_event() sequence.

Virtualisation in particular makes the current fixed min_delta of 0x300
inappropriate under some circumstances, as the CP0_Count and CP0_Compare
registers may be being emulated by the hypervisor, and the frequency may
not correspond directly to the CPU frequency.

We actually use twice the median of multiple 75th percentiles of
multiple measurements of how long the mips_next_event() sequence takes,
in order to fairly efficiently eliminate outliers due to unexpected
hypervisor latency (which would need handling with retries when it
occurs during normal operation anyway).
