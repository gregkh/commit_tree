staging: rtl8712: rtl871x_mlme: Clean up tests if NULL returned on failure

Some functions like kmalloc/kzalloc return NULL on failure.
When NULL represents failure, !x is commonly used.

This was done using Coccinelle:

@@
expression *e;
identifier l1;
@@

e = \(kmalloc\|kzalloc\|kcalloc\|devm_kzalloc\)(...);
...
- e == NULL
+ !e
