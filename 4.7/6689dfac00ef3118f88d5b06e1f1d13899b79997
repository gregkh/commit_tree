ata: sata_dwc_460ex: set dma_boundary to 0x1fff

The original code states:

	Make sure a LLI block is not created that will span 8K max FIS
	boundary. If the block spans such a FIS boundary, there is a chance
	that a DMA burst will cross that boundary -- this results in an error
	in the host controller.

Since we have switched to generic DMAengine API we satisfy above by setting
dma_boundary value to 0x1fff.
