MIPS: BMIPS: local_r4k___flush_cache_all needs to blast S-cache

local_r4k___flush_cache_all() is missing a special check for BMIPS5000
processors, we need to blast the S-cache, just like other MTI processors
since we have an inclusive cache. We also need an additional __sync() to
make sure this is completed.
