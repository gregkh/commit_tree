vlan: use a valid default mtu value for vlan over macsec

macsec can't cope with mtu frames which need vlan tag insertion, and
vlan device set the default mtu equal to the underlying dev's one.
By default vlan over macsec devices use invalid mtu, dropping
all the large packets.
This patch adds a netif helper to check if an upper vlan device
needs mtu reduction. The helper is used during vlan devices
initialization to set a valid default and during mtu updating to
forbid invalid, too bit, mtu values.
The helper currently only check if the lower dev is a macsec device,
if we get more users, we need to update only the helper (possibly
reserving an additional IFF bit).
