xfs: add configuration of error failure speed

On reception of an error, we can fail immediately, perform some
bound amount of retries or retry indefinitely. The current behaviour
we have is to retry forever.

However, we'd like the ability to choose how long the filesystem
should try after an error, it can either fail immediately, retry a
few times, or retry forever. This is implemented by using
max_retries sysfs attribute, to hold the amount of times we allow
the filesystem to retry after an error. Being -1 a special case
where the filesystem will retry indefinitely.

Add both a maximum retry count and a retry timeout so that we can
bound by time and/or physical IO attempts.

Finally, plumb these into xfs_buf_iodone error processing so that
the error behaviour follows the selected configuration.
