thermal: cpu_cooling: fix improper order during initialization

The freq_table array is not populated before calling
thermal_of_cooling_register. The code which populates the freq table was
introduced in commit f6859014.
This should be done before registering new thermal cooling device.
The log shows effects of this wrong decision.
