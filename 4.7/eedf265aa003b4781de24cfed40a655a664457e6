devpts: Make each mount of devpts an independent filesystem.

The /dev/ptmx device node is changed to lookup the directory entry "pts"
in the same directory as the /dev/ptmx device node was opened in.  If
there is a "pts" entry and that entry is a devpts filesystem /dev/ptmx
uses that filesystem.  Otherwise the open of /dev/ptmx fails.

The DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES configuration option is removed, so that
userspace can now safely depend on each mount of devpts creating a new
instance of the filesystem.

Each mount of devpts is now a separate and equal filesystem.

Reserved ttys are now available to all instances of devpts where the
mounter is in the initial mount namespace.

A new vfs helper path_pts is introduced that finds a directory entry
named "pts" in the directory of the passed in path, and changes the
passed in path to point to it.  The helper path_pts uses a function
path_parent_directory that was factored out of follow_dotdot.

In the implementation of devpts:
 - devpts_mnt is killed as it is no longer meaningful if all mounts of
   devpts are equal.
 - pts_sb_from_inode is replaced by just inode->i_sb as all cached
   inodes in the tty layer are now from the devpts filesystem.
 - devpts_add_ref is rolled into the new function devpts_ptmx.  And the
   unnecessary inode hold is removed.
 - devpts_del_ref is renamed devpts_release and reduced to just a
   deacrivate_super.
 - The newinstance mount option continues to be accepted but is now
   ignored.

In devpts_fs.h definitions for when !CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS are removed as
they are never used.

Documentation/filesystems/devices.txt is updated to describe the current
situation.

This has been verified to work properly on openwrt-15.05, centos5,
centos6, centos7, debian-6.0.2, debian-7.9, debian-8.2, ubuntu-14.04.3,
ubuntu-15.10, fedora23, magia-5, mint-17.3, opensuse-42.1,
slackware-14.1, gentoo-20151225 (13.0?), archlinux-2015-12-01.  With the
caveat that on centos6 and on slackware-14.1 that there wind up being
two instances of the devpts filesystem mounted on /dev/pts, the lower
copy does not end up getting used.
