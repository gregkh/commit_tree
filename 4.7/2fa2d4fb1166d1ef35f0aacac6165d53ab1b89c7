IB/core: Fix a potential array overrun in CMA and SA agent

Fix array overrun when going over callback table.
In declaration of callback table, the max size isn't provided and
in registration phase, it is provided.

There is potential scenario where a new operation is added
and it is not supported by current client. The acceptance of
such operation by ib_netlink will cause to array overrun.

Fixes: b493d91d333e ("iwcm: common code for port mapper")
Fixes: 2ca546b92a02 ("IB/sa: Route SA pathrecord query through netlink")
