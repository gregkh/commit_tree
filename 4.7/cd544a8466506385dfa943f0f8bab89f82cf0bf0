ARM: dts: sun8i: Orangepi plus gpio keys fixes and improvements

Fix the following issues with the gpio_keys node:
1) Use of undocumented input-name property
2) Use of a unit-address on the sw2 node
3) Having "PL03" in the pinctrl node which does not exist, this should
   be "PL3"

And add support for the sw2 button on the board.
