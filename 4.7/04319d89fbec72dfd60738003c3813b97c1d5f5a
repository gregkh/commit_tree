drm/vmwgfx: Add an option to change assumed FB bpp

Offer an option for advanced users who want larger modes at 16bpp.

This becomes necessary after the fix: "Work around mode set
failure in 2D VMs."  Without this patch, there would be no way
for existing advanced users to get to a high res mode, and the
regression is they will likely get a black screen after a software
update on their current VM.
