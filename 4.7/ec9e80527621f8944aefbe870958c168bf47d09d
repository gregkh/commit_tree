phy: rcar-gen3-usb2, rcar-gen2: Use ARCH_RENESAS

Make use of ARCH_RENESAS in place of ARCH_SHMOBILE.
A now redundant dependency on OF is also dropped.

This is part of an ongoing process to migrate from ARCH_SHMOBILE to
ARCH_RENESAS the motivation for which being that RENESAS seems to be a more
appropriate name than SHMOBILE for the majority of Renesas ARM based SoCs.
