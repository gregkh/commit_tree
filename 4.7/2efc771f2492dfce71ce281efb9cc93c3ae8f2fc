powerpc/eeh: Ignore handlers in eeh_pe_reset_and_recover()

The function eeh_pe_reset_and_recover() is used to recover EEH
error when the passthrough device are transferred to guest and
backwards, meaning the device's driver is vfio-pci or none. In
both cases, the handlers triggered by eeh_report_reset() and
eeh_report_resume() shouldn't be called.

This ignores the error handlers from eeh_report_reset() and
eeh_report_resume().
