xprtrdma: Avoid using Write list for small NFS READ requests

Avoid the latency and interrupt overhead of registering a Write
chunk when handling NFS READ requests of a few hundred bytes or
less.

This change does not interoperate with Linux NFS/RDMA servers
that do not have commit 9d11b51ce7c1 ('svcrdma: Fix send_reply()
scatter/gather set-up'). Commit 9d11b51ce7c1 was introduced in v4.3,
and is included in 4.2.y, 4.1.y, and 3.18.y.

Oracle bug 22925946 has been filed to request that the above fix
be included in the Oracle Linux UEK4 NFS/RDMA server.

Red Hat bugzillas 1327280 and 1327554 have been filed to request
that RHEL NFS/RDMA server backports include the above fix.

Workaround: Replace the "proto=rdma,port=20049" mount options
with "proto=tcp" until commit 9d11b51ce7c1 is applied to your
NFS server.
