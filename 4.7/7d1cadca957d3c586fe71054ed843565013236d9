serial: imx: support RS-485 Rx disable on Tx

Some RS-232 to RS-485 transceivers require Rx to be disabled on Tx to
avoid echo of Tx data into the Rx buffer. Specifically, the XR3160E
RS-232/RS-485/RS-422 transceiver behaves this way.

This commit disables Rx on active Tx when SER_RS485_ENABLED is active and
SER_RS485_RX_DURING_TX is disabled.

Note that this is a change in behavior of the driver. Until now
SER_RS485_RX_DURING_TX was enabled unconditionally even when disabled in
the TIOCSRS485 ioctl serial_rs485 flags field.
