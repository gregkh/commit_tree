powerpc/eeh: Restore initial state in eeh_pe_reset_and_recover()

The function eeh_pe_reset_and_recover() is used to recover EEH
error when the passthrou device are transferred to guest and
backwards. The content in the device's config space will be lost
on PE reset issued in the middle of the recovery. The function
saves/restores it before/after the reset. However, config access
to some adapters like Broadcom BCM5719 at this point will causes
fenced PHB. The config space is always blocked and we save 0xFF's
that are restored at late point. The memory BARs are totally
corrupted, causing another EEH error upon access to one of the
memory BARs.

This restores the config space on those adapters like BCM5719
from the content saved to the EEH device when it's populated,
to resolve above issue.
