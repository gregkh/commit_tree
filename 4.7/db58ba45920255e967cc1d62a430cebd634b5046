bpf: wire in data and data_end for cls_act_bpf

allow cls_bpf and act_bpf programs access skb->data and skb->data_end pointers.
The bpf helpers that change skb->data need to update data_end pointer as well.
The verifier checks that programs always reload data, data_end pointers
after calls to such bpf helpers.
We cannot add 'data_end' pointer to struct qdisc_skb_cb directly,
since it's embedded as-is by infiniband ipoib, so wrapper struct is needed.
