perf trace: Move syscall table id <-> name routines to separate class

We're using libaudit for doing name to id and id to syscall name
translations, but that makes 'perf trace' to have to wait for newer
libaudit versions supporting recently added syscalls, such as
"userfaultfd" at the time of this changeset.

We have all the information right there, in the kernel sources, so move
this code to a separate place, wrapped behind functions that will
progressively use the kernel source files to extract the syscall table
for use in 'perf trace'.
