intel_idle: add BXT support

Broxton has all the HSW C-states, except C3.
BXT C-state timing is slightly different.

Here we trust the IRTL MSRs as authority
on maximum C-state latency, and override the driver's tables
with the values found in the associated IRTL MSRs.
Further we set the target_residency to 1x maximum latency,
trusting the hardware demotion logic.
