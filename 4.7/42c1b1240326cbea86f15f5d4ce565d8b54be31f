libceph: handle_one_map()

Separate osdmap handling from decoding and iterating over a bag of maps
in a fresh MOSDMap message.  This sets up the scene for the updated OSD
client.

Of particular importance here is the addition of pi->was_full, which
can be used to answer "did this pool go full -> not-full in this map?".
This is the key bit for supporting pool quotas.

We won't be able to downgrade map_sem for much longer, so drop
downgrade_write().
