mac80211: fix last RX rate data consistency

When storing the last_rate_* values in the RX code, there's nothing
to guarantee consistency, so a concurrent reader could see, e.g.
last_rate_idx on the new value, but last_rate_flag still on the old,
getting completely bogus values in the end.

To fix this, I lifted the sta_stats_encode_rate() function from my
old rate statistics code, which encodes the entire rate data into a
single 16-bit value, avoiding the consistency issue.
