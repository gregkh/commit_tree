serial: 8250_pci: report DCD and DSR signals as active for Bay Trail

Bay Trail UART port does not support DCD and DSR lines. The driver
shall report that these signals are permanently active. This patch
is for HSUART enumerated via PCI.

For ACPI, see commit dfd37668ea6d ("serial: 8250_dw: Fix get_mctrl
behaviour"). The commit also describes the possible issue if these
signals are enabled on a port without these pins.
