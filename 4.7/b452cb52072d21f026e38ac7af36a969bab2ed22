KVM: arm/arm64: Remove the IRQ field from struct irq_phys_map

The communication of a Linux IRQ number from outside the VGIC to the
vgic was a leftover from the day when the vgic code cared about how a
particular device injects virtual interrupts mapped to a physical
interrupt.

We can safely remove this notion, leaving all physical IRQ handling to
be done in the device driver (the arch timer in this case), which makes
room for a saner API for the new VGIC.
