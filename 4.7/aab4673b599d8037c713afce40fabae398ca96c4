MIPS: malta-time: Start GIC count before syncing to RTC

The sampling of the GIC counter on Malta after observing a rising edge
of the RTC update flag differs slightly between the first and second
sample, with the first sample also calling gic_start_count(). The two
samples should really be taken as similarly as possible to get the most
accurate figure, so move the gic_start_count() call before detecting the
rising edge.
