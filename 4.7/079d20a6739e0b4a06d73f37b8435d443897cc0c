qed: Reset link on IOV disable

PF updates its VFs' bulletin boards with link configurations whenever
the physical carrier changes or whenever hyper-user explicitly requires
some setting of the VFs link via the hypervisor's PF.

Since the bulletin board is getting cleaned as part of the IOV disable
flow on the PF side, re-enabling sriov would lead to a VF that sees the
carrier as 'down', until an event causing the PF to re-fill the bulletin
with the link configuration would occur.

To fix this we simply refelect the link state during the flows, giving
the later VFs a default reflecting the PFs link state.
