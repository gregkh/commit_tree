percpu: fix synchronization between chunk->map_extend_work and chunk destruction

Atomic allocations can trigger async map extensions which is serviced
by chunk->map_extend_work.  pcpu_balance_work which is responsible for
destroying idle chunks wasn't synchronizing properly against
chunk->map_extend_work and may end up freeing the chunk while the work
item is still in flight.

This patch fixes the bug by rolling async map extension operations
into pcpu_balance_work.
