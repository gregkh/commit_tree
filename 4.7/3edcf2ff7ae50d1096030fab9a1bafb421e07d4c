x86/platform/UV: Allocate common per node hub info structs on local node

Allocate and setup per node hub info structs.  CPU 0/Node 0 hub info
is statically allocated to be accessible early in system startup.  The
remaining hub info structs are allocated on the node's local memory,
and shared among the CPU's on that node.  This leaves the small amount
of info unique to each CPU in the per CPU info struct.

Memory is saved by combining the common per node info fields to common
node local structs.  In addtion, since the info is read only only after
setup, it should stay in the L3 cache of the local processor socket.
This should therefore improve the cache hit rate when a group of cpus
on a node are all interrupted for a common task.
