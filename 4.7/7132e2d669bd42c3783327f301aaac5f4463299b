ftrace: Match dot symbols when searching functions on ppc64

In the ppc64 big endian ABI, function symbols point to function
descriptors. The symbols which point to the function entry points
have a dot in front of the function name. Consequently, when the
ftrace filter mechanism searches for the symbol corresponding to
an entry point address, it gets the dot symbol.

As a result, ftrace filter users have to be aware of this ABI detail on
ppc64 and prepend a dot to the function name when setting the filter.

The perf probe command insulates the user from this by ignoring the dot
in front of the symbol name when matching function names to symbols,
but the sysfs interface does not. This patch makes the ftrace filter
mechanism do the same when searching symbols.

Fixes the following failure in ftracetest's kprobe_ftrace.tc:

  .../kprobe_ftrace.tc: line 9: echo: write error: Invalid argument

That failure is on this line of kprobe_ftrace.tc:

  echo _do_fork > set_ftrace_filter

This is because there's no _do_fork entry in the functions list:

  # cat available_filter_functions | grep _do_fork
  ._do_fork

This change introduces no regressions on the perf and ftracetest
testsuite results.
