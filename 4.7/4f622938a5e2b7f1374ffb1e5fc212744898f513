dax: Allow DAX code to replace exceptional entries

Currently we forbid page_cache_tree_insert() to replace exceptional radix
tree entries for DAX inodes. However to make DAX faults race free we will
lock radix tree entries and when hole is created, we need to replace
such locked radix tree entry with a hole page. So modify
page_cache_tree_insert() to allow that.
