cpufreq: Support for fast frequency switching

Modify the ACPI cpufreq driver to provide a method for switching
CPU frequencies from interrupt context and update the cpufreq core
to support that method if available.

Introduce a new cpufreq driver callback, ->fast_switch, to be
invoked for frequency switching from interrupt context by (future)
governors supporting that feature via (new) helper function
cpufreq_driver_fast_switch().

Add two new policy flags, fast_switch_possible, to be set by the
cpufreq driver if fast frequency switching can be used for the
given policy and fast_switch_enabled, to be set by the governor
if it is going to use fast frequency switching for the given
policy.  Also add a helper for setting the latter.

Since fast frequency switching is inherently incompatible with
cpufreq transition notifiers, make it possible to set the
fast_switch_enabled only if there are no transition notifiers
already registered and make the registration of new transition
notifiers fail if fast_switch_enabled is set for at least one
policy.

Implement the ->fast_switch callback in the ACPI cpufreq driver
and make it set fast_switch_possible during policy initialization
as appropriate.
