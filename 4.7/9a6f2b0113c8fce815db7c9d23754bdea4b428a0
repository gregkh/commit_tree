net: mdio: Fix lockdep falls positive splat

MDIO devices can be stacked upon each other. The current code supports
two levels, which until recently has been enough for a DSA mdio bus on
top of another bus. Now we have hardware which has an MDIO mux in the
middle.

Define an MDIO MUTEX class with three levels.
