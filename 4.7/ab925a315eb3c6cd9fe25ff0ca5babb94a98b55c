mmc: dw_mmc: avoid using dmaengine_terminate_all

dmaengine_terminate_all is deprecated and should be
replaced by more explicit synchronous and asynchronous
terminate functions. This change is based on the
commit b36f09c3c441 ("dmaengine: Add transfer termination
synchronization support"). Currently dw_mci_stop_dma
may be called under the spinlock, let's migrate
dmaengine_terminate_all to async terminate. This could
avoid the race condition of use-after-free resouce of
dmaengine once slave-dma driver implement the synchronize
method.
