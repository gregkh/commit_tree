netfilter: x_tables: validate targets of jumps

When we see a jump also check that the offset gets us to beginning of
a rule (an ipt_entry).

The extra overhead is negible, even with absurd cases.

300k custom rules, 300k jumps to 'next' user chain:
[ plus one jump from INPUT to first userchain ]:

Before:
real    0m24.874s
user    0m7.532s
sys     0m16.076s

After:
real    0m27.464s
user    0m7.436s
sys     0m18.840s
