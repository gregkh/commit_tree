MIPS: BMIPS: Add missing 7038 L1 register cells to BCM7435

7435 has 4 7038 L1 base register address for each of its Core + TP (for a total
of 4 threads of execution), add the two missing cells for Core 1. We are
providing HW interrupts 2/3 even for Core 1/TP0/TP1 because that's what they
are, and we can later decide to remap these in software to provide proper
interrupt affinity/parenting.
