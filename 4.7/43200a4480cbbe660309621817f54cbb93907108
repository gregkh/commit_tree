can: at91_can: RX queue could get stuck at high bus load

At high bus load it could happen that "at91_poll()" enters with all RX
message boxes filled up. If then at the end the "quota" is exceeded as
well, "rx_next" will not be reset to the first RX mailbox and hence the
interrupts remain disabled.
