powerpc/nohash: Fix build break with 64K pages

Commit 74701d5947a6 "powerpc/mm: Rename function to indicate we are
allocating fragments" renamed page_table_free() to pte_fragment_free().
One occurrence was mistyped as pte_fragment_fre().

This only breaks the nohash 64K page build, which is not the default or
enabled in any defconfig.
