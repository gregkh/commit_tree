sbs-battery: fix power status when battery charging near dry

POWER_SUPPLY_STATUS_NOT_CHARGING is used for AC connected, but
battery not charging (e.g. because battery temperature is out
of acceptable range).

When battery is charging near dry and BATTERY_FULL_DISCHARGED is set,
it is wrong to set as POWER_SUPPLY_STATUS_NOT_CHARGING.
Just use BATTERY_DISCHARGING to decide the power supply status is
discharging or charging.
