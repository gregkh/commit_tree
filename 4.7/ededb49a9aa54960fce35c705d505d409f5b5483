m32r: fix build failure

m32r allmodconfig build was failing with the error:

  ERROR: "smp_flush_cache_all" [drivers/misc/lkdtm.ko] undefined!

lkdtm driver at drivers/misc is using flush_icache_range() which for
m32r is defined as smp_flush_cache_all() if CONFIG_SMP is defined.  But
as smp_flush_cache_all() was not exported so the build was failing with
the error of undefined symbol.
