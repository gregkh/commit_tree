cpufreq: powernv: Remove flag use-case of policy->driver_data

commit 1b0289848d5d ("cpufreq: powernv: Add sysfs attributes to show
throttle stats") used policy->driver_data as a flag for one-time creation
of throttle sysfs files. Instead of this use 'kernfs_find_and_get()' to
check if the attribute already exists. This is required as
policy->driver_data is used for other purposes in the later patch.
