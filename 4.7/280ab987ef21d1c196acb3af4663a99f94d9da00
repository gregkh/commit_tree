wil6210: fix race conditions in p2p listen and search

Fix 2 race conditions found during test runs of P2P discovery:
1. Because wil_p2p_cancel_listen was not protected, user space
could start a new P2P listen/search before wmi_stop_discovery
completed. This caused a crash in the firmware.
2. In P2P listen, when listen timer expires and user space calls
cancel_remain_on_channel at the same time, code could send the
cfg80211_remain_on_channel_expired notification twice.

Added protections with wil->mutex to several places that call
wmi_stop_discovery.
