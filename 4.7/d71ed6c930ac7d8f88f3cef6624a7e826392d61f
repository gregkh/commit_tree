mnt: fs_fully_visible test the proper mount for MNT_LOCKED

MNT_LOCKED implies on a child mount implies the child is locked to the
parent.  So while looping through the children the children should be
tested (not their parent).

Typically an unshare of a mount namespace locks all mounts together
making both the parent and the slave as locked but there are a few
corner cases where other things work.
