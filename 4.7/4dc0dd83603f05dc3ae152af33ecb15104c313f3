spi: rockchip: Signal unfinished DMA transfers

When using DMA, the transfer_one callback should return 1 because the
transfer hasn't finished yet.

A previous commit changed the function to return 0 when the DMA channels
were correctly prepared.

This manifested in Veyron boards with this message:

[ 1.983605] cros-ec-spi spi0.0: EC failed to respond in time
