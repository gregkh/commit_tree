xprtrdma: Bound the inline threshold values

Currently the sysctls that allow setting the inline threshold allow
any value to be set.

Small values only make the transport run slower. The default 1KB
setting is as low as is reasonable. And the logic that decides how
to divide a Send buffer between RPC-over-RDMA header and RPC message
assumes (but does not check) that the lower bound is not crazy (say,
57 bytes).

Send and receive buffers share a page with some control information.
Values larger than about 3KB can't be supported, currently.
