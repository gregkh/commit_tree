[media] si2168: change the i2c gate to be mux-locked

The root i2c adapter lock is then no longer held by the i2c mux during
accesses behind the i2c gate, and such accesses need to take that lock
just like any other ordinary i2c accesses do.

So, declare the i2c gate mux-locked, and zap the code that makes the
i2c accesses unlocked. But add a mutex so that firmware commands are
still serialized.
