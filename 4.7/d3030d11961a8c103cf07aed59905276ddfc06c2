ASoC: ak4642: Enable cache usage to fix crashes on resume

The ak4642 driver is using a regmap cache sync to restore the
configuration of the chip on resume but (as Peter observed) does not
actually define a register cache which means that the resume is never
going to work and we trigger asserts in regmap.  Fix this by enabling
caching.
