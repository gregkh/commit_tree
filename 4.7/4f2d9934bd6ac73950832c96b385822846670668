drm/i915: Pass drm_frambuffer to intel_compute_page_offset()

intel_compute_page_offsets() gets passed a bunch of the framebuffer
metadate sepearately. Just pass the framebuffer itself to make life
simpler for the caller, and make it less likely they would make a
mistake in the order of the arguments (as most as just unsigned ints and
such).

We still pass the pitch explicitly since for 90/270 degree rotation
the caller has to pass in the right thing.
