Btrfs: add validadtion checks for chunk loading

To prevent fuzzed filesystem images from panic the whole system,
we need various validation checks to refuse to mount such an image
if btrfs finds any invalid value during loading chunks, including
both sys_array and regular chunks.

Note that these checks may not be sufficient to cover all corner cases,
feel free to add more checks.
