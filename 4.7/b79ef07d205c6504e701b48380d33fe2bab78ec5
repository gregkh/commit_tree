serial: doc: Use port->state instead of info

As of commit ebd2c8f6d2ec4012 ("serial: kill off uart_info"), the
circular transmission buffer is part of struct uart_state instead of
struct uart_info. Make it clear this structure is pointed to from struct
uart_port.

Change 'circ' to 'circ_buf' to match the structure name while we're at
it.
