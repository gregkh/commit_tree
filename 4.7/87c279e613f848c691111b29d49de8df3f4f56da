blk-mq: really fix plug list flushing for nomerge queues

Commit 0809e3ac6231 ("block: fix plug list flushing for nomerge queues")
updated blk_mq_make_request() to set request_count even when
blk_queue_nomerges() returns true. However, blk_mq_make_request() only
does limited plugging and doesn't use request_count;
blk_sq_make_request() is the one that should have been fixed. Do that
and get rid of the unnecessary work in the mq version.
