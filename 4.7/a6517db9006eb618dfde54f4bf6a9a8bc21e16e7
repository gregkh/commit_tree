lpfc: Fix crash when unregistering default rpi.

The default rpi completion handler does back to back puts to force the
removal of the ndlp. This ends up calling lpfc_unreg_rpi after the
reference count is at 0.

Fix:  Check the reference count of the ndlp before getting the ref to
make sure we are not getting a reference on a removed object.
