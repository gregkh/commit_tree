MIPS: BMIPS: Add cpu-feature-overrides.h

BMIPS_GENERIC being multiplatform and intended to support BMIPS3200,
BMIPS3300, BMIPS4350, BMIPS4380 and BMIPS5000-class processors, there is
not much more we can put in there since they do not share the same I and
D cache line sizes at all (doubled for every new generation
essentially), some processors have a S-cache, some don't, some have a
FPU, some don't.
