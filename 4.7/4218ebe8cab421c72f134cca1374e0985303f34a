crypto: drbg - set HMAC key only when altered

The HMAC implementation allows setting the HMAC key independently from
the hashing operation. Therefore, the key only needs to be set when a
new key is generated.

This patch increases the speed of the HMAC DRBG by at least 35% depending
on the use case.

The patch is fully CAVS tested.
