coresight: tmc: modifying naming convention

According to the TMC architectural state machine, the 'stopped'
state is reached when bit 2 (TMCReady) of the TMC Status register
turns to '1'.  The code is correct but the naming convention isn't.

The 'Triggered' bit occupies position '1' of the TMC Status register
and has nothing to do with the indication of the TMC entering the
stopped state. As such renaming function "tmc_wait_for_triggered()"
and changing the #define to reflect what the code is really doing.

This patch has no effect other than clarifying the semantic.
