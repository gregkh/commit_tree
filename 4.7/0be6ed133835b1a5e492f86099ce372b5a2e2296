mac80211: move averaged values out of rx_stats

Move the averaged values out of rx_stats and into rx_stats_avg,
to cleanly split them out. The averaged ones cannot be supported
for parallel RX in a per-CPU fashion, while the other values can
be collected per CPU and then combined/selected when needed.
