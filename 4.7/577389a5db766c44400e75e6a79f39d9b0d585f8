i40e/i40evf: Add support for IPIP and SIT offloads

Looking over the documentation it turns out enabling IPIP and SIT offloads
for i40e is pretty straightforward.  As such I decided to enable them with
this patch.  In my testing I am seeing an improvement of 8 to 10 Gb/s
for IPIP and SIT tunnels with this offload enabled.
