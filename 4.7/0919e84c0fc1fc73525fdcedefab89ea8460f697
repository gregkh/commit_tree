KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: Add IRQ sync/flush framework

Implement the framework for syncing IRQs between our emulation and
the list registers, which represent the guest's view of IRQs.
This is done in kvm_vgic_flush_hwstate and kvm_vgic_sync_hwstate,
which gets called on guest entry and exit.
The code talking to the actual GICv2/v3 hardware is added in the
following patches.
