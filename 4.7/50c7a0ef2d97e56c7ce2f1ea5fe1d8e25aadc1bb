ASoC: wm8940: Enable cache usage to fix crashes on resume

The wm8940 driver is using a regmap cache sync to restore the
configuration of the chip when switching from OFF to STANDBY, but does
not actually define a register cache which means that the restore is
never going to work and we trigger asserts in regmap.  Fix this by
enabling caching.

fix crashes on resume") by Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>.
