KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: vgic_init: implement map_resources

map_resources is the last initialization step. It is executed on
first VCPU run. At that stage the code checks that userspace has provided
the base addresses for the relevant VGIC regions, which depend on the
type of VGIC that is exposed to the guest.  Also we check if the two
regions overlap.
If the checks succeeded, we register the respective register frames with
the kvm_io_bus framework.

If we emulate a GICv2, the function also forces vgic_init execution if
it has not been executed yet. Also we map the virtual GIC CPU interface
onto the guest's CPU interface.
