ath10k: combine txrx and replenish task

Since tx completion and rx indication processing are moved out
of txrx tasklet and rx ring lock contention also removed from txrx
for rx_ind messages, it would be efficient to combine both replenish
and txrx tasks. Refill threshold is adjusted for both AP135 and AP148
(low and high end systems). With this adjustment in AP135, TCP DL is
improved from 603 Mbps to 620 Mbps and UDP DL is improved from 758 Mbps
to 803 Mbps. Also no watchdog are observed on UDP BiDi.
