x86: remove more uaccess_32.h complexity

I'm looking at trying to possibly merge the 32-bit and 64-bit versions
of the x86 uaccess.h implementation, but first this needs to be cleaned
up.

For example, the 32-bit version of "__copy_from_user_inatomic()" is
mostly the special cases for the constant size, and it's actually almost
never relevant.  Most users aren't actually using a constant size
anyway, and the few cases that do small constant copies are better off
just using __get_user() instead.

So get rid of the unnecessary complexity.
