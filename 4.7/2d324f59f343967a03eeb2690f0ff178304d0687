Btrfs: fix unexpected return value of fiemap

btrfs's fiemap is supposed to return 0 on success and return < 0 on
error. however, ret becomes 1 after looking up the last file extent:

  btrfs_lookup_file_extent ->
    btrfs_search_slot(..., ins_len=0, cow=0)

and if the offset is beyond EOF, we'll get 'path' pointed to the place
of potentail insertion, and ret == 1.

This may confuse applications using ioctl(FIEL_IOC_FIEMAP).
