ARM: dts: omap5-board-common: Describe the voltage supply mapping accurately

OMAP5uEVM based platforms share a similar voltage rail map. This
should be properly described in device tree, without this regulator core
will be unable to determine the source voltage of LDOs such as LDO9 and
SMPS10 which could be configured for bypass depending on the voltage
requested of them. This results in conditions such as:

ldo9: bypassed regulator has no supply!
ldo9: failed to get the current voltage(-517)
palmas-pmic 48070000.i2c:palmas@48:palmas_pmic: failed to register
48070000.i2c:palmas@48:palmas_pmic regulator
