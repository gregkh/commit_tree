ixgbe: Clean up interface for firmware commands

Clean up the interface for issuing firmware commands to use a
void * instead of a u32 *. This eliminates a number of casts.
Also clean up ixgbe_host_interface_command in a few other ways,
eliminating comparisons with 0, redundant parens and minor
formatting issues.
