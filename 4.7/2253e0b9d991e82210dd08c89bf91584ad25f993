MIPS: OCTEON: Remove some code limiting NR_IRQS to 255

Follow-on patches for OCTEON III will increase the number of irqs to
potentially more than 256.

Increase the width of the octeon_irq_ciu_to_irq to int to be able to
handle this case.  Remove the hacky code that verified that u8 would
not be overflowed.
