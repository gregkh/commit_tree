gpio: Allow PC/104 devices on X86_64

With the introduction of the ISA_BUS_API Kconfig option, ISA-style
drivers may be built for X86_64 architectures. This patch changes the
ISA Kconfig option dependency of the PC/104 drivers to ISA_BUS_API, thus
allowing them to build for X86_64 as they are expected to.
