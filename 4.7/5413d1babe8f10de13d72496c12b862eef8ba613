net: do not block BH while processing socket backlog

Socket backlog processing is a major latency source.

With current TCP socket sk_rcvbuf limits, I have sampled __release_sock()
holding cpu for more than 5 ms, and packets being dropped by the NIC
once ring buffer is filled.

All users are now ready to be called from process context,
we can unblock BH and let interrupts be serviced faster.

cond_resched_softirq() could be removed, as it has no more user.
