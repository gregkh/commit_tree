dell-rbtn: Ignore ACPI notifications if device is suspended

Some BIOSes unconditionally send an ACPI notification to RBTN when the
system is resuming from suspend. This makes dell-rbtn send an input
event to userspace as if a function key was pressed. Prevent this by
ignoring all the notifications received while the device is suspended.
