IB/hfi1: Always turn on CDRs for low power QSFP modules

Clock and data recovery mechanisms (CDRs) in active QSFP modules
can be turned on or off to improve the bit error rate observed on
the channel. Signal integrity and bit error rate requirements require
us to always turn on any CDRs present in low power cables (power
dissipation 2.5W or lower). However, we adhere to the platform
designer's settings (provided in the platform configuration) for
higher power cables (dissipation 3.5W or higher) if the platform
designer has determined that the platform requires the CDRs to be
turned on (or off) and is capable of supplying and cooling the higher
power modules.

This patch also introduces the get_qsfp_power_class function to
centralize the bit twiddling required to determine the QSFP power class
across the code. Reusing this function improves the readability of code
that depends on knowing the power class of the cable, such as the
active and optical channel tuning algorithm.
