MIPS: Fix BC1{EQ,NE}Z return offset calculation

The conditions for branching when emulating the BC1EQZ & BC1NEZ
instructions were backwards, leading to each of those instructions being
treated as the other. Fix this by reversing the conditions, and clear up
the code a little for readability & checkpatch.
