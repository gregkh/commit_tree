MIPS: genex: Indent delay slots & clean whitespace

Various branches and jumps in noreorder parts of genex.S don't have
their delay slot instructions indented conventionally with the extra
space.

Fix these, as well as various other inconsistent whitespace problems in
this file, such as spaces used after some opcodes instead of a tab.
