tracing: Fix unsigned comparison to zero in hist trigger code

Fengguang Wu's bot found two comparisons of unsigned integers to zero. These
were real bugs, as it would miss error conditions returned to zero.

trace_events_hist.c:426:6-9: WARNING: Unsigned expression compared with zero: idx < 0
trace_events_hist.c:568:5-14: WARNING: Unsigned expression compared with zero: n_entries < 0
