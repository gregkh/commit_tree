IB/hfi1: Correctly compute node interval

The computation of the interval of an interval RB node
was incorrect leading to data corruption due to the RB
search algorithm not properly finding the all RB nodes
in an MMU invalidation interval.

The problem stemmed from the fact that the beginning
address of the node's range was being aligned to a page
boundary. For certain buffer sizes, this would lead to
a end address calculation that was off by 1 page.

An important aspect of keeping the RB same is also
updating the node's range in the case it's being extended.
