MAINTAINERS: add kexec_core.c and kexec_file.c

In the below commits kexec.c was split to kexec.c, kexec_file.c and
kexec_core.c.

commit a43cac0d9dc2 ("kexec: split kexec_file syscall code to kexec_file.c")
commit 2965faa5e03d ("kexec: split kexec_load syscall from kexec core code")

Both kexec_file.c and kexec_core.c still belong to the kexec component.
