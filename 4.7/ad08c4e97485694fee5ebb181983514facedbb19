EDAC, sb_edac: Remove double buffering of error records

In the bad old days the functions from x86_mce_decoder_chain could be
called in machine check context. So we used to carefully copy them and
defer processing until later. But in

  f29a7aff4bd60 ("x86/mce: Avoid potential deadlock due to printk() in MCE context")

we switched the logging code to save the record in a genpool, and call
the functions that registered to be notified later from a work queue.

So drop all the double buffering and do all the work we want to do as
soon as sbridge_mce_check_error() is called.
