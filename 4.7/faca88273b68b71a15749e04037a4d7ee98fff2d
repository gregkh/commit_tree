RDMA/nes: replace custom print_hex_dump()

There is no need to duplicate a lot of code that is in the kernel library for ages.
Replace duplicating code by calling to print_hex_dump() directly.

Note that output is slightly changed:
- hex and ascii parts have just two spaces delimeter
- there is no delimeter for ascii portions
- file and line removed from prefix (they were redundant anyway since previous
  output shows same closer enough)
