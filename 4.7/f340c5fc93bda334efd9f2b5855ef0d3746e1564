perf stat: Scale values by unit before metrics

Scale values by unit before passing them to the metrics printing
functions.  This is needed for TopDown, because it needs to scale the
slots correctly by pipeline width / SMTness.

For existing metrics it shouldn't make any difference, as those
generally use events that don't have any units.
