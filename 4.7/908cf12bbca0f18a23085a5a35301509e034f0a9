i2c: octeon: Missing AAK flag in case of I2C_M_RECV_LEN

During receive the controller requires the AAK flag for all
bytes but the final one. This was wrong in case of I2C_M_RECV_LEN,
where the decision if the final byte is to be transmitted
happened before adding the additional received length byte.

Set the AAK flag if additional bytes are to be received.
