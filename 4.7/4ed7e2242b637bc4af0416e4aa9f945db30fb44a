drm/vmwgfx: Check pin count before attempting to move a buffer

In certain scenarios, e.g. when fbdev is enabled, we can get into
a situation where a vmw_framebuffer_pin() is called on a buffer
that is already pinned.

When this happens, ttm_bo_validate() will unintentially remove the
TTM_PL_FLAG_NO_EVICT flag, thus unpinning it, and leaving no way
to actually pin the buffer again.

To prevent this, if a buffer is already pinned, then instead of
calling ttm_bo_validate(), just make sure the proposed placement is
compatible with the existing placement.

This is the 2nd patch in a 3-patch series to fix a console black
screen issue on Ubuntu 16.04 server.  This fixes a BUG_ON()
condition where a pinned buffer gets accidentally put onto the
LRU list.
