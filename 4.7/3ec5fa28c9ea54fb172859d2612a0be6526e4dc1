IB/hfi1: Remove FULL_MGMT_P_KEY from pkey table at link up

FULL_MGMT_P_KEY doesn't get cleared from the pkey table at link bounce
because the link down and link bounce code paths are different when
moving a QSFP cable on a switch. This causes an HFI unit connected to a
switch to try to be initialized to an FM node when the QSFP cable is
moved from a MgmtAllowed=NO port to a MgmtAllowed=YES port and back to a
MgmtAllowed=NO port. Remove FULL_MGMT_P_KEY from pkey table at link up.
