drivers:hv: Lock access to hyperv_mmio resource tree

In existing code, this tree of resources is created
in single-threaded code and never modified after it is
created, and thus needs no locking.  This patch introduces
a semaphore for tree access, as other patches in this
series introduce run-time modifications of this resource
tree which can happen on multiple threads.
