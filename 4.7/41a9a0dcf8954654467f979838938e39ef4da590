md-cluster: change resync lock from asynchronous to synchronous

If multiple nodes choose to attempt do resync at the same time
they need to be serialized so they don't duplicate effort. This
serialization is done by locking the 'resync' DLM lock.

Currently if a node cannot get the lock immediately it doesn't
request notification when the lock becomes available (i.e.
DLM_LKF_NOQUEUE is set), so it may not reliably find out when it
is safe to try again.

Rather than trying to arrange an async wake-up when the lock
becomes available, switch to using synchronous locking - this is
a lot easier to think about.  As it is not permitted to block in
the 'raid1d' thread, move the locking to the resync thread.  So
the rsync thread is forked immediately, but it blocks until the
resync lock is available. Once the lock is locked it checks again
if any resync action is needed.

A particular symptom of the current problem is that a node can
get stuck with "resync=pending" indefinitely.
