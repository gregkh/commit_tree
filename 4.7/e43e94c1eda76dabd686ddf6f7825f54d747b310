cpufreq: Fix GOV_LIMITS handling for the userspace governor

Currently, the userspace governor only updates frequency on GOV_LIMITS
if policy->cur falls outside policy->{min/max}. However, it is also
necessary to update current frequency on GOV_LIMITS to match the user
requested value if it can be achieved within the new policy->{max/min}.

This was previously the behaviour in the governor until commit d1922f0
("cpufreq: Simplify userspace governor") which incorrectly assumed that
policy->cur == user requested frequency via scaling_setspeed. This won't
be true if the user requested frequency falls outside policy->{min/max}.
Ex: a temporary thermal cap throttled the user requested frequency.

Fix this by storing the user requested frequency in a seperate variable.
The governor will then try to achieve this request on every GOV_LIMITS
change.
