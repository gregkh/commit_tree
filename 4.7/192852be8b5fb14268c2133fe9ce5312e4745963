xfs: configurable error behavior via sysfs

We need to be able to change the way XFS behaviours in error
conditions depending on the type of underlying storage. This is
necessary for handling non-traditional block devices with extended
error cases, such as thin provisioned devices that can return ENOSPC
as an IO error.

Introduce the basic sysfs infrastructure needed to define and
configure error behaviours. This is done to be generic enough to
extend to configuring behaviour in other error conditions, such as
ENOMEM, which also has different desired behaviours according to
machine configuration.
