crypto: sun4i-ss - Replace spinlock_bh by spin_lock_irq{save|restore}

The current sun4i-ss driver could generate data corruption when ciphering/deciphering.
It occurs randomly on end of handled data.
No root cause have been found and the only way to remove it is to replace
all spin_lock_bh by their irq counterparts.
