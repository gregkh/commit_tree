zram: remove max_comp_streams internals

Remove the internal part of max_comp_streams interface, since we
switched to per-cpu streams.  We will keep RW max_comp_streams attr
around, because:

a) we may (silently) switch back to idle compression streams list and
   don't want to disturb user space

b) max_comp_streams attr must wait for the next 'lay off cycle'; we
   give user space 2 years to adjust before we remove/downgrade the attr,
   and there are already several attrs scheduled for removal in 4.11, so
   it's too late for max_comp_streams.

This slightly change a user visible behaviour:

- First, reading from max_comp_stream file now will always return the
  number of online CPUs.

- Second, writing to max_comp_stream will not take any effect.
