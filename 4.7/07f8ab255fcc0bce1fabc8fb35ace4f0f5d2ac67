KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix build error in book3s_hv.c

When CONFIG_KVM_XICS is enabled, CPU_UP_PREPARE and other macros for
CPU states in linux/cpu.h are needed by arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv.c.
Otherwise, build error as below is seen:

   gwshan@gwshan:~/sandbox/l$ make arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv.o
    :
   CC      arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv.o
   arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv.c: In function ‘kvmppc_cpu_notify’:
   arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv.c:3072:7: error: ‘CPU_UP_PREPARE’ \
   undeclared (first use in this function)

This fixes the issue introduced by commit <6f3bb80944> ("KVM: PPC:
Book3S HV: kvmppc_host_rm_ops - handle offlining CPUs").
