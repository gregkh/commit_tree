libata-core: Allow longer timeout for drive spinup from PUIS

When spinning up a drive from powered on standby mode (PUIS),
SETFEATURES_SPINUP is executed with the default timeout used
for any SETFEATURES subcommand, that is 5+10 seconds. The
total 15s is too short for some drives to complete spinup
(e.g. drives with a large indirection table stored on media),
resulting in ata_dev_read_id to fail twice on the execution
of SETFEATURES_SPINUP. For this feature, allow a larger
default timeout of 30 seconds. However, in the same spirit
as with the timeout of other feature subcommands, do not
ignore ata_probe_timeout if it is set).
