dm raid: make sure no feature flags are set in metadata

Given we don't yet support any feature flags in the dm-raid ondisk
metadata (see: 'features' member of 'struct dm_raid_superblock'),
add a check to ensure no flags are actually set, if any features are
set reject the activation of the RAID mapping.

This is to prevent possible data corruption in case of a kernel
downgrade when there'll potentially be feature flags set by a future
dm-raid target.
