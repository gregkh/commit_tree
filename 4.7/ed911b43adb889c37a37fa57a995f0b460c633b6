pvclock: Get rid of __pvclock_read_cycles in function pvclock_read_flags

There is a generic function __pvclock_read_cycles to be used to get both
flags and cycles. For function pvclock_read_flags, it's useless to get
cycles value. To make this function be more effective, get this variable
flags directly in function.
