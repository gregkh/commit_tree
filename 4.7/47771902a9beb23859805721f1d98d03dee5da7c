ath10k: introduce Extended Resource Config support for 10.4

Add API support for Extended Resource Configuration for 10.4. This
is useful to enable new features like Peer Stats, LTEU etc if the
firmware advertises support for the service. This is also done to
provide backward compatibility with older firmware. Also for clarity
send default host platform type as 'WMI_HOST_PLATFORM_HIGH_PERF',
though this should not make any difference in functionality
