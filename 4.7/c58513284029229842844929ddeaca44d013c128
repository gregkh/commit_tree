arm64: KVM: vgic-v3: Relax synchronization when SRE==1

The GICv3 backend of the vgic is quite barrier heavy, in order
to ensure synchronization of the system registers and the
memory mapped view for a potential GICv2 guest.

But when the guest is using a GICv3 model, there is absolutely
no need to execute all these heavy barriers, and it is actually
beneficial to avoid them altogether.

This patch makes the synchonization conditional, and ensures
that we do not change the EL1 SRE settings if we do not need to.
