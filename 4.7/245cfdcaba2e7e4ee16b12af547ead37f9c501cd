netfilter: conntrack: small refactoring of conntrack seq_printf

The iteration process is lockless, so we test if the conntrack object is
eligible for printing (e.g. is AF_INET) after obtaining the reference
count.

Once we put all conntracks into same hash table we might see more
entries that need to be skipped.

So add a helper and first perform the test in a lockless fashion
for fast skip.

Once we obtain the reference count, just repeat the check.

Note that this refactoring also includes a missing check for unconfirmed
conntrack entries due to slab rcu object re-usage, so they need to be
skipped since they are not part of the listing.
