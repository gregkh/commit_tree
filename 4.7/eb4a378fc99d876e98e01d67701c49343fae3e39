ALSA: fireworks: drop reuse of incoming packet parameter for ougoing packet parameter

On Fireworks board module of Echo Audio, TSB43Cx43A (IceLynx Micro, iCEM)
is used to process payload of isochronous packets. There's an public
document of this chip[1]. This document is for firmware programmers to
transfer/receive AMDTP with IEC60958 data format, however in clause 2.5,
2.6 and 2.7, we can see system design to utilize the sequence of value in
SYT field of CIP header. In clause 2.3, we can see the specification of
Audio Master Clock (MCLK) from iCEM.

Well, this clock is actually not used for sampling clock. This can be
confirmed when corresponding driver transfer random value as the sequence
of SYT field. Even if in this case, the unit generates proper sound.

Additionally, in unique command set for this board module, the format
of CIP is changed; for IEC 61883-6 mode which we use, and for Windows
Operating System. In the latter mode, the whole 32 bit field in second CIP
header from Windows driver is used to represent counter of packets (NO-DATA
code is still used for packets without data blocks). If the master clock
was physically used by DSP on the board module, the Windows driver must
have transferred correct sequence of SYT field.

Furthermore, as long as seeing capacities of AudioFire2, AudioFire4,
AudioFire8, AudioFirePre8 and AudioFire12, these models don't support
SYT-Match clock source.

Summary, we have no need to relate incoming/outgoing packets. This commit
drops reusing SYT sequence of incoming packets for outgoing packets.
