i2c: mux: add common data for every i2c-mux instance

All i2c-muxes have a parent adapter and one or many child
adapters. A mux also has some means of selection. Previously,
this was stored per child adapter, but it is only needed
to keep track of this per mux.

Add an i2c mux core, that keeps track of this consistently.

Also add some glue for users of the old interface, which will
create one implicit mux core per child adapter.
