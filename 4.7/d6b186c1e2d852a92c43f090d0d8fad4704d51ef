x86/xen: avoid m2p lookup when setting early page table entries

When page tables entries are set using xen_set_pte_init() during early
boot there is no page fault handler that could handle a fault when
performing an M2P lookup.

In 64 bit guests (usually dom0) early_ioremap() would fault in
xen_set_pte_init() because an M2P lookup faults because the MFN is in
MMIO space and not mapped in the M2P.  This lookup is done to see if
the PFN in in the range used for the initial page table pages, so that
the PTE may be set as read-only.

The M2P lookup can be avoided by moving the check (and clear of RW)
earlier when the PFN is still available.
