perf record: Rename variable to make code clear

record__mmap_read() writes data from ring buffer into perf.data.  'head'
is maintained by the kernel, points to the last written record.
'old' is maintained by perf, points to the record read in previous
round. record__mmap_read() saves data from 'old' to 'head' to
perf.data.

The names of these variables are not very intutive. In addition,
when dealing with backward writing ring buffer, the md->prev pointer
should point to 'head' instead of the last byte it got.

Add 'start' and 'end' pointer to make code clear and set md->prev to
'head' instead of the moved 'old' pointer. This patch doesn't change
behavior since:

    buf = &data[old & md->mask];
    size = head - old;
    old += size;     <--- Here, old == head
