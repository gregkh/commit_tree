usb: musb: Ensure rx reinit occurs for shared_fifo endpoints

shared_fifo endpoints would only get a previous tx state cleared
out, the rx state was only cleared for non shared_fifo endpoints
Change this so that the rx state is cleared for all endpoints.
This addresses an issue that resulted in rx packets being dropped
silently.
