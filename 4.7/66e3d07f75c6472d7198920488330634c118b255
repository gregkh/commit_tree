lightnvm: calculate rrpc total blocks and sectors up front

Calculate rrpc total blocks and sectors up front, make sense
to use them. For example, we use rrpc->nr_sects to calculate rrpc
area size, but it makes no sense if we don't initialize it up front,
since it would be zero until we finish rrpc luns init.
