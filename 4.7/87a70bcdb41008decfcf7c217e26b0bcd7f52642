MIPS: smp-cps: Skip core setup if coherent

In preparation for supporting MIPSr6 multithreading (ie. VPs) which will
begin execution from the core reset vector, skip core level setup if the
core is already coherent. This is never the case when a core is first
started, since boot_core explicitly clears the cores GCR_Cx_COH_EN
register, and always the case when secondary VPs start since the first
VP to start will have enabled coherence after initialising the core &
its caches.

One notable side effect of this patch is that eva_init gets called
slightly earlier, prior to mips_cps_core_init rather than after it.
