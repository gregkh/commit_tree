drm: Put legacy lastclose work into drm_legacy_dev_reinit

Except for the ->lasclose driver callback evrything in drm_lastclose()
is all legacy cruft and can be hidden. Which means another
dev->struct_mutex site disappears entirely for modern drivers!

Also while at it change the return value of drm_lastclose to void
since it will always succeed. No one checks the return value of
close() anyway, ever.

v2: Move misplaced hunk, spotted by 0day.
