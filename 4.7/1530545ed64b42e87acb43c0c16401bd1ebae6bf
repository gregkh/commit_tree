GRO: Add support for TCP with fixed IPv4 ID field, limit tunnel IP ID values

This patch does two things.

First it allows TCP to aggregate TCP frames with a fixed IPv4 ID field.  As
a result we should now be able to aggregate flows that were converted from
IPv6 to IPv4.  In addition this allows us more flexibility for future
implementations of segmentation as we may be able to use a fixed IP ID when
segmenting the flow.

The second thing this does is that it places limitations on the outer IPv4
ID header in the case of tunneled frames.  Specifically it forces the IP ID
to be incrementing by 1 unless the DF bit is set in the outer IPv4 header.
This way we can avoid creating overlapping series of IP IDs that could
possibly be fragmented if the frame goes through GRO and is then
resegmented via GSO.
