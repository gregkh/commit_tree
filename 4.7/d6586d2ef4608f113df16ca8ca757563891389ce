net: w5100: move mmiowb into register access callbacks

Instead of sprinkle mmiowb over the driver code, move it into primary
register write callbacks. (w5100_write, w5100_write16, w5100_writebuf)

This is a preparation for supporting SPI interface which doesn't use
MMIO for accessing w5100 registers.
