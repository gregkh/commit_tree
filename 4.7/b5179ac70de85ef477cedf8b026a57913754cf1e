sched/fair: Prepare to fix fairness problems on migration

Mike reported that our recent attempt to fix migration problems:

  3a47d5124a95 ("sched/fair: Fix fairness issue on migration")

broke interactivity and the signal starve test. We reverted that
commit and now let's try it again more carefully, with some other
underlying problems fixed first.

One problem is that I assumed ENQUEUE_WAKING was only set when we do a
cross-cpu wakeup (migration), which isn't true. This means we now
destroy the vruntime history of tasks and wakeup-preemption suffers.

Cure this by making my assumption true, only call
sched_class::task_waking() when we do a cross-cpu wakeup. This avoids
the indirect call in the case we do a local wakeup.
