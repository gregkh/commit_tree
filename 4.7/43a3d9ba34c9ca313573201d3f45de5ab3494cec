i40evf: Allow PF driver to configure RSS

If the PF driver reports proper support, allow the PF driver to
configure RSS on the behalf of the VF driver. This will allow for RSS
support on future hardware without changes to the VF driver.

Unfortunately, the old RSS code still needs to stay as the driver needs
to be compatible with PF drivers that don't support this interface. But
this change still simplifies the data structures a bunch and makes this
code simpler to read and maintain.
