Bluetooth: Fix setting NO_BREDR advertising flag

If we're dealing with a single-mode controller or BR/EDR is disable
for a dual-mode one, the NO_BREDR flag needs to be unconditionally
present in the advertising data. This patch moves it out from behind
an extra condition to be always set in the create_instance_adv_data()
function if BR/EDR is disabled.
