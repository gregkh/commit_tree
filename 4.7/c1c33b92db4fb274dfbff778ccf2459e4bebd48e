locking/locktorture: Fix NULL pointer dereference for cleanup paths

It has been found that paths that invoke cleanups through
lock_torture_cleanup() can trigger NULL pointer dereferencing
bugs during the statistics printing phase. This is mainly
because we should not be calling into statistics before we are
sure things have been set up correctly.

Specifically, early checks (and the need for handling this in
the cleanup call) only include parameter checks and basic
statistics allocation. Once we start write/read kthreads
we then consider the test as started. As such, update the function
in question to check for cxt.lwsa writer stats, if not set,
we either have a bogus parameter or -ENOMEM situation and
therefore only need to deal with general torture calls.
