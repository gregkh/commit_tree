MIPS: BMIPS: Clear MIPS_CACHE_ALIASES earlier

BMIPS5000 and BMIPS5200 processor have no D cache aliases, and this is
properly handled by the per-CPU override added at the end of
r4k_cache_init(), the problem is that the output of probe_pcache()
disagrees with that, since this is too late:

Primary instruction cache 32kB, VIPT, 4-way, linesize 64 bytes.
Primary data cache 32kB, 4-way, VIPT, cache aliases, linesize 32 bytes

With the change moved earlier, we now have a consistent output with the
settings we are intending to have:

Primary instruction cache 32kB, VIPT, 4-way, linesize 64 bytes.
Primary data cache 32kB, 4-way, VIPT, no aliases, linesize 32 bytes
