powerpc/powernv/npu: TCE Kill helpers cleanup

NPU PHB TCE Kill register is exactly the same as in the rest of POWER8
so let's reuse the existing code for NPU. The only bit missing is
a helper to reset the entire TCE cache so this moves such a helper
from NPU code and renames it.

Since pnv_npu_tce_invalidate() does really invalidate the entire cache,
this uses pnv_pci_ioda2_tce_invalidate_entire() directly for NPU.
This adds an explicit comment for workaround for invalidating NPU TCE
cache.
