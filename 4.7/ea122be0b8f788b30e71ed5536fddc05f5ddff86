lib/mpi: mpi_write_sgl(): purge redundant pointer arithmetic

Within the copying loop in mpi_write_sgl(), we have

  if (lzeros) {
    ...
    p -= lzeros;
    y = lzeros;
  }
  p = p - (sizeof(alimb) - y);

If lzeros == 0, then y == 0, too. Thus, lzeros gets subtracted and added
back again to p.

Purge this redundancy.
