pnfs: only tear down lsegs that precede seqid in LAYOUTRETURN args

LAYOUTRETURN is "special" in that servers and clients are expected to
work with old stateids. When the client sends a LAYOUTRETURN with an old
stateid in it then the server is expected to only tear down layout
segments that were present when that seqid was current. Ensure that the
client handles its accounting accordingly.
