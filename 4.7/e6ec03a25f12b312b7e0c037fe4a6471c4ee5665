autofs braino fix for do_last()

It's an analogue of commit 7500c38a (fix the braino in "namei:
massage lookup_slow() to be usable by lookup_one_len_unlocked()").
The same problem (->lookup()-returned unhashed negative dentry
just might be an autofs one with ->d_manage() that would wait
until the daemon makes it positive) applies in do_last() - we
need to do follow_managed() first.

Fortunately, remaining callers of follow_managed() are OK - only
autofs has that weirdness (negative dentry that does not mean
an instant -ENOENT)) and autofs never has its negative dentries
hashed, so we can't pick one from a dcache lookup.

->d_manage() is a bloody mess ;-/
