PM / devfreq: Add new passive governor

This patch adds the new passive governor for DEVFREQ framework. The following
governors are already present and used for DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency
Scaling) drivers. The following governors are independently used for one device
driver which don't give the influence to other device drviers and also don't
receive the effect from other device drivers.
- ondemand / performance / powersave / userspace

The passive governor depends on operation of parent driver with specific
governos extremely and is not able to decide the new frequency by oneself.
According to the decided new frequency of parent driver with governor,
the passive governor uses it to decide the appropriate frequency for own
device driver. The passive governor must need the following information
from device tree:
- the source clock and OPP tables
- the instance of parent device

For exameple,
there are one more devfreq device drivers which need to change their source
clock according to their utilization on runtime. But, they share the same
power line (e.g., regulator). So, specific device driver is operated as parent
with ondemand governor and then the rest device driver with passive governor
is influenced by parent device.
