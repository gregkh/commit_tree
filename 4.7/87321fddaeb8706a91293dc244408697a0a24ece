MIPS: Implement __arch_bitrev* using bitswap for MIPSr6

Release 6 of the MIPS architecture introduced the bitswap instruction,
which reverses the bits within each byte of a word. Make use of this
instruction to implement the __arch_bitrev* functions, which should be
faster for most MIPSr6 CPUs, reduces code size slightly and allows us to
avoid the lookup table used by the generic implementation, saving 256
bytes in the kernel binary by dropping that.
