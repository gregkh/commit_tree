drm/i915: Refactor duplicate object vmap functions

We now have two implementations for vmapping a whole object, one for
dma-buf and one for the ringbuffer. If we couple the mapping into the
obj->pages lifetime, then we can reuse an obj->mapping for both and at
the same time couple it into the shrinker. There is a third vmapping
routine in the cmdparser that maps only a range within the object, for
the time being that is left alone, but will eventually use these routines
in order to cache the mapping between invocations.

v2: Mark the failable kmalloc() as __GFP_NOWARN (vsyrjala)
v3: Call unpin_vmap from the right dmabuf unmapper

v4: Rename vmap to map as we don't wish to imply the type of mapping
involved, just that it contiguously maps the object into kernel space.
Add kerneldoc and lockdep annotations
