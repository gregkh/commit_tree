lightnvm: fix "warning: ‘ret’ may be used uninitialized"

This fixes the following warnings:
drivers/lightnvm/sysblk.c:125:9: warning: ‘ret’ may be used
uninitialized in this function

drivers/lightnvm/sysblk.c:275:15: warning: ‘ret’ may be used
uninitialized in this function

In both cases, ret is only set from within a loop that may not be entered.
