net: qrtr: fix build problems

Having multiple loadable modules with the same name cannot work
with modprobe, and having both net/qrtr/smd.ko and drivers/soc/qcom/smd.ko
results in a (somewhat cryptic) build error:

ERROR: "qcom_smd_driver_unregister" [net/qrtr/smd.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "qcom_smd_driver_register" [net/qrtr/smd.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "qcom_smd_set_drvdata" [net/qrtr/smd.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "qcom_smd_send" [net/qrtr/smd.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "qcom_smd_get_drvdata" [net/qrtr/smd.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "qcom_smd_driver_unregister" [drivers/soc/qcom/wcnss_ctrl.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "qcom_smd_driver_register" [drivers/soc/qcom/wcnss_ctrl.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "qcom_smd_set_drvdata" [drivers/soc/qcom/wcnss_ctrl.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "qcom_smd_send" [drivers/soc/qcom/wcnss_ctrl.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "qcom_smd_get_drvdata" [drivers/soc/qcom/wcnss_ctrl.ko] undefined!

Also, the qrtr driver uses the SMD interface and has a Kconfig dependency,
but also allows for compile-testing when SMD is disabled. However, if
with QCOM_SMD=m and COMPILE_TEST=y we can end up with QRTR_SMD=y and
that fails with a related link error.

The changes the dependency so we can still compile-test the driver but
not have it built-in if SMD is a module, to avoid running in the broken
configuration, and changes the Makefile to provide the driver under
a different module name.
