macvlan: fix failure during registration v3

If macvlan_common_newlink fails in register_netdevice after macvlan_init
then it decrements port->count twice, first in macvlan_uninit (from
register_netdevice or rollback_registered) and then again in
macvlan_common_newlink.
A similar problem may exist in the ipvlan driver.
This patch consolidates modifications to port->count into macvlan_init
and macvlan_uninit (thanks to Eric Biederman for suggesting this approach).

v3: remove macvtap specific bits.
