rcu: Remove superfluous versions of rcu_read_lock_sched_held()

Currently, we have four versions of rcu_read_lock_sched_held(), depending
on the combined choices on PREEMPT_COUNT and DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC.  However,
there is an existing function preemptible() that already distinguishes
between the PREEMPT_COUNT=y and PREEMPT_COUNT=n cases, and allows these
four implementations to be consolidated down to two.

This commit therefore uses preemptible() to achieve this consolidation.

Note that there could be a small performance regression in the case
of CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC=y && PREEMPT_COUNT=n.  However, given the
overhead associated with CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC=y, this should be
down in the noise.
