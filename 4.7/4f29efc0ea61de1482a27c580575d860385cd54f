ALSA: hda - Add missing capture_hook calls for dyn-ADC PCM streams

The calls for capture_hook were missing in dyn_adc_capture_pcm_prepare
and cleanup callbacks.  Luckily there are no users of the capture
hooks with dyn-adc PCM, so far, thus this doesn't change the behavior
of existing devices, but it's a fix for a future usage.
