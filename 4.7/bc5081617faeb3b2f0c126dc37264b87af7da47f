usb: dwc3: drop FIFO resizing logic

That FIFO resizing logic was added to support OMAP5
ES1.0 which had a bogus default FIFO size. I can't
remember the exact size of default FIFO, but it was
less than one bulk superspeed packet (<1024) which
would prevent USB3 from ever working on OMAP5 ES1.0.

However, OMAP5 ES1.0 support has been dropped by
commit aa2f4b16f830 ("ARM: OMAP5: id: Remove ES1.0
support") which renders FIFO resizing unnecessary.
