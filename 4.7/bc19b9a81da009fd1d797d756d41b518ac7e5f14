PM / AVS: rockchip-io: make io-domains a child of the GRF

IO-domain handling is part of the general register files, so should live
under the grf directly. This change allows the grf to be a simple-mfd and
the io-domains fetching the syscon regmap from that parent-node.

The old binding is of course preserved, though deprecated.
