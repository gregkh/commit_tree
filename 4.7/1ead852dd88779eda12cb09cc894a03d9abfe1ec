x86/amd_nb: Fix boot crash on non-AMD systems

Fix boot crash that triggers if this driver is built into a kernel and
run on non-AMD systems.

AMD northbridges users call amd_cache_northbridges() and it returns
a negative value to signal that we weren't able to cache/detect any
northbridges on the system.

At least, it should do so as all its callers expect it to do so. But it
does return a negative value only when kmalloc() fails.

Fix it to return -ENODEV if there are no NBs cached as otherwise, amd_nb
users like amd64_edac, for example, which relies on it to know whether
it should load or not, gets loaded on systems like Intel Xeons where it
shouldn't.
