staging: lustre: llite: Delaying creation of client side proc entries.

In client_common_fill_super() proc entries are created before
before cl_sb_init() and therefore lu_site is not allocated resulting
in client crash when tried reading lu_site stats.
Delaying creation of proc entries after creation of all required data
structures fixed the problem.
