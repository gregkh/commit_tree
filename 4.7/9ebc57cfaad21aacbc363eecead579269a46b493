tracing: Rename check_ignore_pid() to ignore_this_task()

The name "check_ignore_pid" is confusing in trying to figure out if the pid
should be ignored or not. Rename it to "ignore_this_task" which is pretty
straight forward, as a task (not a pid) is passed in, and should if true
should be ignored.
