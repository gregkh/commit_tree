ALSA: hda - Use eld notifier for Intel SandyBridge and IvyBridge HDMI/DP

Intel SandyBridge and IvyBridge (CougarPoint and PantherPoint
platforms) have also the same digital port vs audio widget mapping
(from port B = NID 0x05 to port D = NID 0x07) as Haswell & co.
So, we can reuse the existing functions for HSW+ for these platforms
without changing there, but just by re-adding the on-demand i915
binding in HDMI codec driver.
