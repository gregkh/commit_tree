clockevents/drivers/dw_apb_timer: Implement ->set_state_oneshot_stopped()

The dw_apb_timer only "supports PERIODIC mode and their drivers emulate
ONESHOT over that" as described in commit 8fff52fd5093 ("clockevents:
Introduce CLOCK_EVT_STATE_ONESHOT_STOPPED state").

Inspired by Viresh, I think the dw_apb_timer also needs to implement
the set_state_oneshot_stopped() which is called by the clkevt core,
when the next event is required at an expiry time of 'KTIME_MAX'. This
normally happens with NO_HZ_{IDLE|FULL} in both LOWRES/HIGHRES modes.

This patch makes the clockevent device to stop on such an event, to
avoid spurious interrupts, as explained by the above commit.
