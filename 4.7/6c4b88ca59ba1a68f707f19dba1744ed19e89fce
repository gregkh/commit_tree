ncr5380: Use DMA hooks for PDMA

Those wrapper drivers which use DMA define the REAL_DMA macro and
those which use pseudo DMA define PSEUDO_DMA. These macros need to be
removed for a number of reasons, not least of which is to have drivers
share more code.

Redefine the PDMA send and receive hooks as DMA setup hooks, so that the
DMA code can be shared by all 5380 wrapper drivers. This will help to
reunify the forked core driver.
