tile: get rid of superfluous __GFP_REPEAT

__GFP_REPEAT has a rather weak semantic but since it has been introduced
around 2.6.12 it has been ignored for low order allocations.

pgtable_alloc_one uses __GFP_REPEAT flag for L2_USER_PGTABLE_ORDER but
the order is either 0 or 3 if L2_KERNEL_PGTABLE_SHIFT for HPAGE_SHIFT.
This means that this flag has never been actually useful here because it
has always been used only for PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY requests.
