ACPI / ARM64: Don't enable ACPI by default on ARM64

If ACPI is selectable it is enabled by default.  This is a good choice
for architectures where the overwhelming majority of systems use ACPI
like x86 and IA-64 but is less clear for architectures where it's less
common like ARM64.  Change the default selection so that it's only done
explicitly on those architectures where ACPI is universally used.
