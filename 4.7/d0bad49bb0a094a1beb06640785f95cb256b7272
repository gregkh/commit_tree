tracing: Add enable_hist/disable_hist triggers

Similar to enable_event/disable_event triggers, these triggers enable
and disable the aggregation of events into maps rather than enabling
and disabling their writing into the trace buffer.

They can be used to automatically start and stop hist triggers based
on a matching filter condition.

If there's a paused hist trigger on system:event, the following would
start it when the filter condition was hit:

  # echo enable_hist:system:event [ if filter] > event/trigger

And the following would disable a running system:event hist trigger:

  # echo disable_hist:system:event [ if filter] > event/trigger

See Documentation/trace/events.txt for real examples.
