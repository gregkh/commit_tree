drm/exynos: Drop dev->struct_mutex from mmap offset function

Simply forgotten about this when I was doing my general cleansing of
simple gem mmap offset functions. There's nothing but core functions
called here, and they all have their own protection already.

Aside: DRM_ERROR for userspace controlled input isn't great, but
that's for another patch.

v2: Use _unlocked unreference (Daniel Stone).
