net: l3mdev: Allow send on enslaved interface

Allow udp and raw sockets to send by oif that is an enslaved interface
versus the l3mdev/VRF device. For example, this allows BFD to use ifindex
from IP_PKTINFO on a receive to send a response without the need to
convert to the VRF index. It also allows ping and ping6 to work when
specifying an enslaved interface (e.g., ping -I swp1 <ip>) which is
a natural use case.
