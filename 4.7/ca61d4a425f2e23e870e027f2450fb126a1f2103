drm/i915/shrinker: Only report objects with extra pinned pages as pinned

When iterating over the bound list, we expect all objects there to have
their pages pinned (by the bound VMA). So only report those objects with
additional pin count on their pages as "pinned". These should be those
objects used for display and hardware access.
