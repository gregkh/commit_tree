MIPS: math-emu: Always propagate sNaN payload in quieting

Propagate sNaN payload in quieting in the legacy-NaN mode as well.  If
clearing the quiet bit would produce infinity, then set the next lower
trailing significand field bit, matching the SB-1 and BMIPS5000 hardware
implementations.  Some other MIPS FPU hardware implementations do
produce the default qNaN bit pattern instead.

This reverts some changes made for semantics preservation with commit
dc3ddf42 [MIPS: math-emu: Update sNaN quieting handlers], consequently
bringing back most of the semantics from before commit fdffbafb [Lots of
FPU bug fixes from Kjeld Borch Egevang.], except from the qNaN produced
in the infinity case.  Previously the default qNaN bit pattern was
produced in that case.
