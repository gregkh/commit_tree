char: Drop bogus dependency of DEVPORT on !M68K

According to full-history-linux commit d3794f4fa7c3edc3 ("[PATCH] M68k
update (part 25)"), port operations are allowed on m68k if CONFIG_ISA is
defined.

However, commit 153dcc54df826d2f ("[PATCH] mem driver: fix conditional
on isa i/o support") accidentally changed an "||" into an "&&",
disabling it completely on m68k. This logic was retained when
introducing the DEVPORT symbol in commit 4f911d64e04a44c4 ("Make
/dev/port conditional on config symbol").

Drop the bogus dependency on !M68K to fix this.
