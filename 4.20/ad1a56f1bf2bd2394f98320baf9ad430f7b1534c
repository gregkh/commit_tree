Revert "drm: crc: Wait for a frame before returning from open()"

This reverts commit e8fa5671183c80342d520ad81d14fa79a9d4a680.

Don't wait for first CRC during crtc_crc_open. It avoids one frame wait
during open. If application want to wait after read call, it can use
poll/read blocking read() call.
