cpufreq: drop ARM_BIG_LITTLE_CPUFREQ support for ARM64

ARM_BIG_LITTLE_CPUFREQ depends on topology_physical_package_id to get
the cluster id which inturn provides the information on related cpus
in the same performance domain.

ARM64 core doesn't provide the cluster information as it's not
architecturally defined. There are no users of this driver in ARM64
after the one and only user(SCPI) moved away. So let's ban the usage
of this driver for ARM64.
