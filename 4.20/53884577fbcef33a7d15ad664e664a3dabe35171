ath10k: skip sending quiet mode cmd for WCN3990

HL2.0 firmware does not support setting quiet mode.  If the host driver sends
the quiet mode setting command to the HL2.0 firmware, it crashes with the below
signature.

fatal error received: err_qdi.c:456:EX:wlan_process:1:WLAN RT:207a:PC=b001b4f0

The quiet mode command support is exposed by the firmware via thermal throttle
wmi service. Enable ath10k thermal support if thermal throttle wmi service bit
is set.  10.x firmware versions support this feature by default, but
unfortunately do not advertise the support via service flags, hence have to
manually set the service flag in ath10k_core_compat_services().

Tested on QCA988X with 10.2.4.70.9-2. Also tested on WCN3990.
