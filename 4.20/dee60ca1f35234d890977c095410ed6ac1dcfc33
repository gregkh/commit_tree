drm/i915/execlists: Delay updating ring register state after resume

Now that we reload both RING_HEAD and RING_TAIL when rebinding the
context, we do not need to scrub those registers immediately on resume.

v2: Handle the perma-pinned contexts.
v3: Set RING_TAIL on context-pin so that we always have known state in
the context image for the ring registers and all parties have similar
code (ripe for refactoring).
