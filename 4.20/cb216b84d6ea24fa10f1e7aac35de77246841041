swiotlb: Skip cache maintenance on map error

If swiotlb_bounce_page() failed, calling arch_sync_dma_for_device() may
lead to such delights as performing cache maintenance on whatever
address phys_to_virt(SWIOTLB_MAP_ERROR) looks like, which is typically
outside the kernel memory map and goes about as well as expected.

Don't do that.
