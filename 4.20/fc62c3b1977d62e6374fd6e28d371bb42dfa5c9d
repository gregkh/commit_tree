Drivers: hv: kvp: Fix two "this statement may fall through" warnings

We don't need to call process_ib_ipinfo() if message->kvp_hdr.operation is
KVP_OP_GET_IP_INFO in kvp_send_key(), because here we just need to pass on
the op code from the host to the userspace; when the userspace returns
the info requested by the host, we pass the info on to the host in
kvp_respond_to_host() -> process_ob_ipinfo(). BTW, the current buggy code
actually doesn't cause any harm, because only message->kvp_hdr.operation
is used by the userspace, in the case of KVP_OP_GET_IP_INFO.

The patch also adds a missing "break;" in kvp_send_key(). BTW, the current
buggy code actually doesn't cause any harm, because in the case of
KVP_OP_SET, the unexpected fall-through corrupts
message->body.kvp_set.data.key_size, but that is not really used: see
the definition of struct hv_kvp_exchg_msg_value.
