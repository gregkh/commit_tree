PCI: Make link active reporting detection generic

The spec has timing requirements when waiting for a link to become active
after a conventional reset.  Implement those hard delays when waiting for
an active link so pciehp and dpc drivers don't need to duplicate this.

For devices that don't support data link layer active reporting, wait the
fixed time recommended by the PCIe spec.
