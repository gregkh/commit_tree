printk: Do not miss new messages when replaying the log

The variable "exclusive_console" is used to reply all existing messages
on a newly registered console. It is cleared when all messages are out.

The problem is that new messages might appear in the meantime. These
are then visible only on the exclusive console.

The obvious solution is to clear "exclusive_console" after we replay
all messages that were already proceed before we started the reply.
