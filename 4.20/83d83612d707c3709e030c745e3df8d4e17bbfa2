mm/memory_hotplug.c: spare unnecessary calls to node_set_state

In node_states_check_changes_online, we check if the node will have to be
set for any of the N_*_MEMORY states after the pages have been onlined.

Later on, we perform the activation in node_states_set_node.  Currently,
in node_states_set_node we set the node to N_MEMORY unconditionally.

This means that we call node_set_state for N_MEMORY every time pages go
online, but we only need to do it if the node has not yet been set for
N_MEMORY.

Fix this by checking status_change_nid.
