x86/kvm/mmu: introduce guest_mmu

When EPT is used for nested guest we need to re-init MMU as shadow
EPT MMU (nested_ept_init_mmu_context() does that). When we return back
from L2 to L1 kvm_mmu_reset_context() in nested_vmx_load_cr3() resets
MMU back to normal TDP mode. Add a special 'guest_mmu' so we can use
separate root caches; the improved hit rate is not very important for
single vCPU performance, but it avoids contention on the mmu_lock for
many vCPUs.

On the nested CPUID benchmark, with 16 vCPUs, an L2->L1->L2 vmexit
goes from 42k to 26k cycles.
