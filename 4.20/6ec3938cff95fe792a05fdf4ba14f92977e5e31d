ataflop: convert to blk-mq

This driver is already pretty broken, in that it has two wait_events()
(one in stdma_lock()) in request_fn. Get rid of the first one by
freezing/quiescing the queue on format, and the second one by replacing
it with stdma_try_lock(). The rest is straightforward. Compile-tested
only and probably incorrect.
