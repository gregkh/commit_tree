PCI: pciehp: Disable hotplug interrupt during suspend

When PCIe hotplug port is transitioned into D3hot, the link to the
downstream component will go down. If hotplug interrupt generation is
enabled when that happens, it will trigger immediately, waking up the
system and bringing the link back up.

To prevent this, disable hotplug interrupt generation when system suspend
is entered. This does not prevent wakeup from low power states according
to PCIe 4.0 spec section 6.7.3.4:

  Software enables a hot-plug event to generate a wakeup event by
  enabling software notification of the event as described in Section
  6.7.3.1. Note that in order for software to disable interrupt generation
  while keeping wakeup generation enabled, the Hot-Plug Interrupt Enable
  bit must be cleared.

So as long as we have set the slot event mask accordingly, wakeup should
work even if slot interrupt is disabled. The port should trigger wake and
then send PME to the root port when the PCIe hierarchy is brought back up.

Limit this to systems using native PME mechanism to make sure older Apple
systems depending on commit e3354628c376 ("PCI: pciehp: Support interrupts
sent from D3hot") still continue working.
