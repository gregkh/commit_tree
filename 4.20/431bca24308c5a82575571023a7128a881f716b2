lib/vsprintf: Hash printed address for netdev bits fallback

The handler for "%pN" falls back to printing the raw pointer value when
using a different format than the (sole supported) special format
"%pNF", potentially leaking sensitive information regarding the kernel
layout in memory.

Avoid this leak by printing the hashed address instead.
Note that there are no in-tree users of the fallback.
