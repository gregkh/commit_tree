dma-direct: fix return value of dma_direct_supported

It appears that in commit 9d7a224b463e ("dma-direct: always allow dma mask
<= physiscal memory size") the logic of the test was changed from a "<" to
a ">=" however I don't see any reason for that change. I am assuming that
there was some additional change planned, specifically I suspect the logic
was intended to be reversed and possibly used for a return. Since that is
the case I have gone ahead and done that.

This addresses issues I had on my system that prevented me from booting
with the above mentioned commit applied on an x86_64 system w/ Intel IOMMU.
