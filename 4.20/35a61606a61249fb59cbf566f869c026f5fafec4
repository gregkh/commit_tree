NFS: Reduce indentation of the switch statement in nfs4_reclaim_open_state()

Most places in the kernel tend to line up cases with the switch to
reduce indentation, so move this over to match that style.
Additionally, I handle the (status >= 0) case in the switch so that we
only "goto restart" from a single place after error handling.
