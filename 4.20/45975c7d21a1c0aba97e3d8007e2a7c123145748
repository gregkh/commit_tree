rcu: Define RCU-sched API in terms of RCU for Tree RCU PREEMPT builds

Now that RCU-preempt knows about preemption disabling, its implementation
of synchronize_rcu() works for synchronize_sched(), and likewise for the
other RCU-sched update-side API members.  This commit therefore confines
the RCU-sched update-side code to CONFIG_PREEMPT=n builds, and defines
RCU-sched's update-side API members in terms of those of RCU-preempt.

This means that any given build of the Linux kernel has only one
update-side flavor of RCU, namely RCU-preempt for CONFIG_PREEMPT=y builds
and RCU-sched for CONFIG_PREEMPT=n builds.  This in turn means that kernels
built with CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU=y have only one rcuo kthread per CPU.
