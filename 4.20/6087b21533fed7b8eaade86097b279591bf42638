media: v4l2-core: cleanup coding style at V4L2 async/fwnode

There are several coding style issues at those definitions,
and the previous patchset added even more.

Address the trivial ones by first calling:

	./scripts/checkpatch.pl --strict --fix-inline include/media/v4l2-async.h include/media/v4l2-fwnode.h include/media/v4l2-mediabus.h drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-async.c drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-fwnode.c

and then manually adjusting the style where needed.
