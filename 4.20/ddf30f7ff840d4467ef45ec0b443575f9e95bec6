ice: Add handler to configure SR-IOV

This patch implements parts of ice_sriov_configure and VF reset flow.

To create virtual functions (VFs), the user sets a value in num_vfs
through sysfs. This results in the kernel calling the handler for
.sriov_configure which is ice_sriov_configure.

VF setup first starts with a VF reset, followed by allocation of the VF
VSI using ice_vf_vsi_setup. Once the VF setup is complete a state bit
ICE_VF_STATE_INIT is set in the vf->states bitmap to indicate that
the VF is ready to go.

Also for VF reset to go into effect, it's necessary to issue a disable
queue command (ice_aqc_opc_dis_txqs). So this patch updates multiple
functions in the disable queue flow to take additional parameters that
distinguish if queues are being disabled due to VF reset.
