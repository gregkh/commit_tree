staging:rtl8192u: Rename sHTCLng - Style

The constant sHTCLng causes a checkpatch issue, due to its use of
CamelCase naming. To correct the issue the constant has been renamed
to HTCLNG.

I'm not sure this is a good name as it communicates very little and
contradicts the block comment above its definition. MCS_LEN might
be a better name if the block comment is correct.

Additionally the block comment has been changed to the recommended
style.

This is a coding style change which should have no impact on runtime
code execution.
