ASoC: AMD: Fix capture unstable in beginning for some runs

alsa_conformance_test -C hw:0,4 -p 1024 --debug

The issue is that in dma pointer function we can have stale value
of the register for current descriptor of channel.
The register retains the number of the last descriptor that
was transferred.

Fix ensures that we report position, 0, till the one period worth of
data is transferred.  After one period of data, in handler of period
completion interrupt we update the config and correct value of descriptor
starts reflecting.
