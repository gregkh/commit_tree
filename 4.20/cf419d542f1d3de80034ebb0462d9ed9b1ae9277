kernel-doc: fix declaration type determination

Make declaration type determination more robust.

When scripts/kernel-doc is deciding if some kernel-doc notation
contains an enum, a struct, a union, a typedef, or a function,
it does a pattern match on the beginning of the string, looking
for a match with one of "struct", "union", "enum", or "typedef",
and otherwise defaults to a function declaration type.
However, if a function or a function-like macro has a name that
begins with "struct" (e.g., struct_size()), then kernel-doc
incorrectly decides that this is a struct declaration.

Fix this by looking for the declaration type keywords having an
ending word boundary (\b), so that "struct_size" will not match
a struct declaration.

I compared lots of html before/after output from core-api, driver-api,
and networking.  There were no differences in any of the files that
I checked.
