f2fs: checkpoint disabling

Note that, it requires "f2fs: return correct errno in f2fs_gc".

This adds a lightweight non-persistent snapshotting scheme to f2fs.

To use, mount with the option checkpoint=disable, and to return to
normal operation, remount with checkpoint=enable. If the filesystem
is shut down before remounting with checkpoint=enable, it will revert
back to its apparent state when it was first mounted with
checkpoint=disable. This is useful for situations where you wish to be
able to roll back the state of the disk in case of some critical
failure.
