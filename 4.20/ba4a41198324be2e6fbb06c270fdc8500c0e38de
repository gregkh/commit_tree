RDMA/mlx5: Add support for flow tag to raw create flow

A user can provide a hint which will be attached to the packet and written
to the CQE on receive. This can be used as a way to offload operations
into the HW, for example parsing a packet which is a tunneled packet, and
if so, pass 0x1 as the hint. The software can use that hint to decapsulate
the packet and parse only the inner headers thus saving CPU cycles.
