net/mlx5: IPSec, Fix the SA context hash key

The commit "net/mlx5: Refactor accel IPSec code" introduced a
bug where asynchronous short time change in hash key value
by create/release SA context might happen during an asynchronous
hash resize operation this could cause a subsequent remove SA
context operation to fail as the key value used during resize is
not the same key value used when remove SA context operation is
invoked.

This commit fixes the bug by defining the SA context hash key
such that it includes only fields that never change during the
lifetime of the SA context object.
