arm64: sysreg: Clean up instructions for modifying PSTATE fields

Instructions for modifying the PSTATE fields which were not supported
in the older toolchains (e.g, PAN, UAO) are generated using macros.
We have so far used the normal sys_reg() helper for defining the PSTATE
fields. While this works fine, it is really difficult to correlate the
code with the Arm ARM definition.

As per Arm ARM, the PSTATE fields are defined only using Op1, Op2 fields,
with fixed values for Op0, CRn. Also the CRm field has been reserved
for the Immediate value for the instruction. So using the sys_reg()
looks quite confusing.

This patch cleans up the instruction helpers by bringing them
in line with the Arm ARM definitions to make it easier to correlate
code with the document. No functional changes.
