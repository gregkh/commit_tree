MIPS: Provide actually relaxed MMIO accessors

Improve performance for the relevant systems and remove the DMA ordering
barrier from `readX_relaxed' and `writeX_relaxed' MMIO accessors, where
it is not needed according to our requirements[1].  For consistency make
the same arrangement with low-level port I/O accessors, but do not
actually provide any accessors making use of it.
