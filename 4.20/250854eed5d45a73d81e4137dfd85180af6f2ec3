media: v4l2-tpg: fix kernel oops when enabling HFLIP and OSD

When the OSD is on (i.e. vivid displays text on top of the test pattern), and
you enable hflip, then the driver crashes.

The cause turned out to be a division of a negative number by an unsigned value.
You expect that -8 / 2U would be -4, but in reality it is 2147483644 :-(
