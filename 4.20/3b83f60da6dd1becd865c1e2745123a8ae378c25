libceph: enable fallback to ceph_msg_new() in ceph_msgpool_get()

ceph_msgpool_get() can fall back to ceph_msg_new() when it is asked for
a message whose front portion is larger than pool->front_len.  However
the caller always passes 0, effectively disabling that code path.  The
allocation goes to the message pool and returns a message with a front
that is smaller than requested, setting us up for a crash.

One example of this is a directory with a large number of snapshots.
If its snap context doesn't fit, we oops in encode_request_partial().
