scsi: lpfc: Raise nvme defaults to support a larger io and more connectivity

When nvme is enabled, change the default for two parameters:
 sg_seg_cnt - raise the per-io sg list size so that 1MB ios are
     supported (based on a 4k buffer per element).
 iocb_cnt - raise the number of buffers used for things like
     NVME LS request/responses to allow more concurrent requests
     to for larger nvme configs.
