vfs: require i_size <= SIZE_MAX in kernel_read_file()

On 32-bit systems, the buffer allocated by kernel_read_file() is too
small if the file size is > SIZE_MAX, due to truncation to size_t.

Fortunately, since the 'count' argument to kernel_read() is also
truncated to size_t, only the allocated space is filled; then, -EIO is
returned since 'pos != i_size' after the read loop.

But this is not obvious and seems incidental.  We should be more
explicit about this case.  So, fail early if i_size > SIZE_MAX.
