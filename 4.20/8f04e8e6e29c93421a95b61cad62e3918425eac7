arm64: ssbd: Add support for PSTATE.SSBS rather than trapping to EL3

On CPUs with support for PSTATE.SSBS, the kernel can toggle the SSBD
state without needing to call into firmware.

This patch hooks into the existing SSBD infrastructure so that SSBS is
used on CPUs that support it, but it's all made horribly complicated by
the very real possibility of big/little systems that don't uniformly
provide the new capability.
