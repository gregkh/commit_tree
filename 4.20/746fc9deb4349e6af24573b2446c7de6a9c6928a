ALSA: hda/ca0132 - Clean up ca0132_alt_out_select

This patch cleans up ca0132_alt_out_select by moving the card specific
output commands into a separate function. As more cards are added, the
function ca0132_alt_out_select is going to get more bloated with these,
so moving into a separate function tries to keep that from happening.
