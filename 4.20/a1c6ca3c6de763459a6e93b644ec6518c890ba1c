kernel: hung_task.c: disable on suspend

It is possible to observe hung_task complaints when system goes to
suspend-to-idle state:

 # echo freeze > /sys/power/state

 PM: Syncing filesystems ... done.
 Freezing user space processes ... (elapsed 0.001 seconds) done.
 OOM killer disabled.
 Freezing remaining freezable tasks ... (elapsed 0.002 seconds) done.

Register a PM notifier to disable the detector on suspend and re-enable
back on wakeup.
