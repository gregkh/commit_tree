brcmfmac: reduce timeout for action frame scan

Finding a common channel to send an action frame out is required for
some action types. Since a loop with several scan retry is used to find
the channel, a short wait time could be considered for each attempt.
This patch reduces the wait time from 1500 to 450 msec for each action
frame scan.

This patch fixes the WFA p2p certification 5.1.20 failure caused by the
long action frame send time.
