lightnvm: pblk: unify vector max req constants

Both NVM_MAX_VLBA and PBLK_MAX_REQ_ADDRS define how many LBAs that
are available in a vector command. pblk uses them interchangeably
in its implementation. Use NVM_MAX_VLBA as the main one and remove
usages of PBLK_MAX_REQ_ADDRS.

Also remove the power representation that only has one user, and
instead calculate it at runtime.
