sparc: Validate VDSO for undefined symbols.

There should be no undefined symbols in the resulting VDSO image(s).

On sparc, fixed register usage can result in undefined symbols ending
up in the image.  To combat this, we do two things:

1) Define current_thread_info() specially when BUILD_DSO.

2) Ignore "#scratch" register undefined symbols in the output.
