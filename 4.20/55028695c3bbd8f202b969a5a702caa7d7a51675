media: vb2: drop VB2_BUF_STATE_PREPARED, use bool prepared/synced instead

The PREPARED state becomes a problem with the request API: a buffer
could be PREPARED but dequeued, or PREPARED and in state IN_REQUEST.

PREPARED is really not a state as such, but more a property of the
buffer. So make new 'prepared' and 'synced' bools instead to remember
whether the buffer is prepared and/or synced or not.

V4L2_BUF_FLAG_PREPARED is only set if the buffer is both synced and
prepared and in the DEQUEUED state.
