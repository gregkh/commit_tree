net/rds: remove user triggered WARN_ON in rds_sendmsg

per comment from Leon in rdma mailing list
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/10/31/312 :

Please don't forget to remove user triggered WARN_ON.
https://lwn.net/Articles/769365/
"Greg Kroah-Hartman raised the problem of core kernel API code that will
use WARN_ON_ONCE() to complain about bad usage; that will not generate
the desired result if WARN_ON_ONCE() is configured to crash the machine.
He was told that the code should just call pr_warn() instead, and that
the called function should return an error in such situations. It was
generally agreed that any WARN_ON() or WARN_ON_ONCE() calls that can be
triggered from user space need to be fixed."

in addition harden rds_sendmsg to detect and overcome issues with
invalid sg count and fail the sendmsg.
