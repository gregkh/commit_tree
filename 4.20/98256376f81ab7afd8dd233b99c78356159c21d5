uapi: linux/blkzoned.h: fix BLKGETZONESZ and BLKGETNRZONES definitions

According to the documentation in include/uapi/asm-generic/ioctl.h,
_IOW means userspace is writing and kernel is reading, and
_IOR means userspace is reading and kernel is writing.

In case of these two ioctls, kernel is writing and userspace is reading,
so they have to be _IOR instead of _IOW.
