signal: Remove the need for __ARCH_SI_PREABLE_SIZE and SI_PAD_SIZE

Rework the defintion of struct siginfo so that the array padding
struct siginfo to SI_MAX_SIZE can be placed in a union along side of
the rest of the struct siginfo members.  The result is that we no
longer need the __ARCH_SI_PREAMBLE_SIZE or SI_PAD_SIZE definitions.
