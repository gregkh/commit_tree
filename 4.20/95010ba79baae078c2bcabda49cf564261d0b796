drm/amdgpu/gmc9: don't keep stolen memory on vega12

vega12 does not appear to be affected by the same issue
as vega10.  Enable the full stolen memory handling on
vega12.  Reserve the appropriate size at init time to avoid
display artifacts and then free it at the end of init once
the new FB is up and running.
