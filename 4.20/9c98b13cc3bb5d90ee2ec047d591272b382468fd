flow_dissector: implements eBPF parser

This eBPF program extracts basic/control/ip address/ports keys from
incoming packets. It supports recursive parsing for IP encapsulation,
and VLAN, along with IPv4/IPv6 and extension headers.  This program is
meant to show how flow dissection and key extraction can be done in
eBPF.
