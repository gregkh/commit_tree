IB/hfi1: Remove race conditions in user_sdma send path

Packet queue state is over used to determine SDMA descriptor
availablitity and packet queue request state.

cpu 0  ret = user_sdma_send_pkts(req, pcount);
cpu 0  if (atomic_read(&pq->n_reqs))
cpu 1  IRQ user_sdma_txreq_cb calls pq_update() (state to _INACTIVE)
cpu 0        xchg(&pq->state, SDMA_PKT_Q_ACTIVE);

At this point pq->n_reqs == 0 and pq->state is incorrectly
SDMA_PKT_Q_ACTIVE.  The close path will hang waiting for the state
to return to _INACTIVE.

This can also change the state from _DEFERRED to _ACTIVE.  However,
this is a mostly benign race.

Remove the racy code path.

Use n_reqs to determine if a packet queue is active or not.
