net/mlx5: Change flow counters addlist type to single linked list

In order to prevent flow counters stats work function from traversing whole
flow counters tree while searching for deleted flow counters, new list to
store deleted flow counters will be added to struct mlx5_fc_stats. However,
the flow counter structure itself has no space left to store any more data
in first cache line. To free space that is needed to store additional list
node, convert current addlist double linked list (two pointers per node) to
atomic single linked list (one pointer per node).

Lockless NULL-terminated single linked list data type doesn't require any
additional external synchronization for operations used by flow counters
module (add single new element, remove all elements from list and traverse
them). Remove addlist_lock that is no longer needed.
