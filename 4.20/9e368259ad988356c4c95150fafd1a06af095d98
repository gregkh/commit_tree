userfaultfd: use ENOENT instead of EFAULT if the atomic copy user fails

Patch series "userfaultfd shmem updates".

Jann found two bugs in the userfaultfd shmem MAP_SHARED backend: the
lack of the VM_MAYWRITE check and the lack of i_size checks.

Then looking into the above we also fixed the MAP_PRIVATE case.

Hugh by source review also found a data loss source if UFFDIO_COPY is
used on shmem MAP_SHARED PROT_READ mappings (the production usages
incidentally run with PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, so the data loss couldn't
happen in those production usages like with QEMU).

The whole patchset is marked for stable.

We verified QEMU postcopy live migration with guest running on shmem
MAP_PRIVATE run as well as before after the fix of shmem MAP_PRIVATE.
Regardless if it's shmem or hugetlbfs or MAP_PRIVATE or MAP_SHARED, QEMU
unconditionally invokes a punch hole if the guest mapping is filebacked
and a MADV_DONTNEED too (needed to get rid of the MAP_PRIVATE COWs and
for the anon backend).

This patch (of 5):

We internally used EFAULT to communicate with the caller, switch to
ENOENT, so EFAULT can be used as a non internal retval.
