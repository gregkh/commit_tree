net: Add struct for fib dump filter

Add struct fib_dump_filter for options on limiting which routes are
returned in a dump request. The current list is table id, protocol,
route type, rtm_flags and nexthop device index. struct net is needed
to lookup the net_device from the index.

Declare the filter for each route dump handler and plumb the new
arguments from dump handlers to ip_valid_fib_dump_req.
