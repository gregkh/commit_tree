usb: gadget: uvc: configfs: Add interface number attributes

The video control and video streaming interface numbers are needed in
the UVC gadget userspace stack to reply to UVC requests. They are
hardcoded to fixed values at the moment, preventing configurations with
multiple functions.

To fix this, make them dynamically discoverable by userspace through
read-only configfs attributes in <function>/control/bInterfaceNumber and
<function>/streaming/bInterfaceNumber respectively.
