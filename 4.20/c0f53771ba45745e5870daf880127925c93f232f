liquidio: read sc->iq_no before release sc

The function lio_vf_rep_packet_sent_callback releases the occupation of
sc via octeon_free_soft_command. sc should not be used after that.
Unfortunately, sc->iq_no is read. To fix this, the patch stores sc->iq_no
into a local variable before releasing sc and then uses the local variable
instead of sc->iq_no.
