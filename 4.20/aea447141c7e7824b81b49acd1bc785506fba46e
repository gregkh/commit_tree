powerpc: Disable -Wbuiltin-requires-header when setjmp is used

The powerpc kernel uses setjmp which causes a warning when building
with clang:

  In file included from arch/powerpc/xmon/xmon.c:51:
  ./arch/powerpc/include/asm/setjmp.h:15:13: error: declaration of
  built-in function 'setjmp' requires inclusion of the header <setjmp.h>
        [-Werror,-Wbuiltin-requires-header]
  extern long setjmp(long *);
              ^
  ./arch/powerpc/include/asm/setjmp.h:16:13: error: declaration of
  built-in function 'longjmp' requires inclusion of the header <setjmp.h>
        [-Werror,-Wbuiltin-requires-header]
  extern void longjmp(long *, long);
              ^

This *is* the header and we're not using the built-in setjump but
rather the one in arch/powerpc/kernel/misc.S. As the compiler warning
does not make sense, it for the files where setjmp is used.
