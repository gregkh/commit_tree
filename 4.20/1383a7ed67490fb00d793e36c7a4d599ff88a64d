vfs: check file ranges before cloning files

Move the file range checks from vfs_clone_file_prep into a separate
generic_remap_checks function so that all the checks are collected in a
central location.  This forms the basis for adding more checks from
generic_write_checks that will make cloning's input checking more
consistent with write input checking.
