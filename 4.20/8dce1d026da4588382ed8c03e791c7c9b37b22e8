ASoC: Intel: common: add table for HDA-based platforms

Expose a table containing machine driver information for HDAudio-based
platforms handled by ASoC on Intel hardware.

We only set constant values that are valid across multiple
platforms. The firmware name used by the DSP will be set dynamically
for each platform.

The table is made of a single entry for now, if we need more
complicated set-up where HDAudio is mixed with ACPI-enumerated devices
(I2C, SoundWire) then we'd expect the differentiation to be handled
through information provided by the BIOS (as done for KBL
Chromebooks).
