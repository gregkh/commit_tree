drm/atmel-hlcdc: support bus-width (12/16/18/24) in endpoint nodes

This beats the heuristic that the connector is involved in what format
should be output for cases where this fails.

E.g. if there is a bridge that changes format between the encoder and the
connector, or if some of the RGB pins between the lcd controller and the
encoder are not routed on the PCB.

This is critical for the devices that have the "conflicting output
formats" issue (SAM9N12, SAM9X5, SAMA5D3), since the most significant
RGB bits move around depending on the selected output mode. For
devices that do not have the "conflicting output formats" issue
(SAMA5D2, SAMA5D4), this is completely irrelevant.
