drm: Use default dma_fence hooks where possible for null syncobj

Both the .enable_signaling and .release of the null syncobj fence
can be replaced by the default callbacks for a small reduction in code
size. In particular the default callback for .release was changed in
commit e28bd101ae1b ("drm: rename null fence to stub fence in syncobj v2")
which neglected its RCU protection.
