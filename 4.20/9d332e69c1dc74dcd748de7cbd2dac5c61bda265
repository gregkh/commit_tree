net: bridge: fix vlan stats use-after-free on destruction

Syzbot reported a use-after-free of the global vlan context on port vlan
destruction. When I added per-port vlan stats I missed the fact that the
global vlan context can be freed before the per-port vlan rcu callback.
There're a few different ways to deal with this, I've chosen to add a
new private flag that is set only when per-port stats are allocated so
we can directly check it on destruction without dereferencing the global
context at all. The new field in net_bridge_vlan uses a hole.

v2: cosmetic change, move the check to br_process_vlan_info where the
    other checks are done
v3: add change log in the patch, add private (in-kernel only) flags in a
    hole in net_bridge_vlan struct and use that instead of mixing
    user-space flags with private flags
