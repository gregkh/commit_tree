x86/mm: Fix exception table comments

The comments here are wrong.  They are too absolute about where
faults can occur when running in the kernel.  The comments are
also a bit hard to match up with the code.

Trim down the comments, and make them more precise.

Also add a comment explaining why we are doing the
bad_area_nosemaphore() path here.
