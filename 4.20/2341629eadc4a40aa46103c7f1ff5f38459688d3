macintosh/adb: Rework printk output again

Avoid the KERN_CONT problem by avoiding message fragments. The problem
arises during async ADB bus probing, when ADB messages may get mixed up
with other messages. See also, commit 4bcc595ccd80 ("printk: reinstate
KERN_CONT for printing continuation lines").

Remove a number of printk() continuation lines by logging handler
changes in adb_try_handler_change() instead.

This patch addresses the problematic use of "\n" at the beginning of
pr_cont() messages, which got overlooked in commit f2be6295684b
("macintosh/adb: Properly mark continued kernel messages").

That commit also changed printk(KERN_DEBUG ...) to pr_debug(...), which
hinders work on low-level ADB driver bugs. Revert that change.
