powerpc/tm: Print 64-bits MSR

On a kernel TM Bad thing program exception, the Machine State Register
(MSR) is not being properly displayed. The exception code dumps a 32-bits
value but MSR is a 64 bits register for all platforms that have HTM
enabled.

This patch dumps the MSR value as a 64-bits value instead of 32 bits. In
order to do so, the 'reason' variable could not be used, since it trimmed
MSR to 32-bits (int).
