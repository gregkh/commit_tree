octeontx2-af: Add NPC KPU profile

NPC block is responsible for parsing and forwarding
packets to different NIXLFs. NPC has 16 KPU engines
(Kangaroo parse engine) and one iKPU which represents
pkinds. Each physical port either CGX/LBK is assigned
a pkind and upon receiving a packet HW takes that port's
pkind and starts parsing as per the KPU engines config.

This patch adds header files which contain configuration
profile/array for each of the iKPU and 16 KPU engines.
