drm/mxsfb: Fix initial corrupt frame when activating display

LCDIF will repeatedly display data from CUR_BUF and set CUR_BUF to
NEXT_BUF when done. Since we are only ever writing to NEXT_BUF the
display will show an initial corrupt frame.

Fix by writing the FB paddr to both CUR_BUF and NEXT_BUF when
activating the CRTC.
