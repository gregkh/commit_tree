iommu/dma: Use fast DMA domain lookup

Most parts of iommu-dma already assume they are operating on a default
domain set up by iommu_dma_init_domain(), and can be converted straight
over to avoid the refcounting bottleneck. MSI page mappings may be in
an unmanaged domain with an explicit MSI-only cookie, so retain the
non-specific lookup, but that's OK since they're far from a contended
fast path either way.
