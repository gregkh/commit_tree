octeontx2-af: Enable packet length and csum validation

Config NPC layer info from KPU profile into protocol
checker to identify outer L2/IPv4/TCP/UDP headers in a
packet. And enable IPv4 checksum validation.

L3/L4 and L4 CSUM validation will be enabled by PF/VF
drivers by configuring NIX_AF_LF(0..127)_RX_CFG via mbox
i.e 'nix_lf_alloc_req->rx_cfg'

Also enable setting of NPC_RESULT_S[L2B] when an outer
L2 broadcast address is detected. This will help in
installing NPC MCAM rules for broadcast packets.
