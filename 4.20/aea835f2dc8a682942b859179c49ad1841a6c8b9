iio: adc: at91: fix wrong channel number in triggered buffer mode

When channels are registered, the hardware channel number is not the
actual iio channel number.
This is because the driver is probed with a certain number of accessible
channels. Some pins are routed and some not, depending on the description of
the board in the DT.
Because of that, channels 0,1,2,3 can correspond to hardware channels
2,3,4,5 for example.
In the buffered triggered case, we need to do the translation accordingly.
Fixed the channel number to stop reading the wrong channel.
