ubifs: Format changes for authentication support

This patch adds the changes to the on disk format needed for
authentication support. We'll add:

* a HMAC covering super block node
* a HMAC covering the master node
* a hash over the root index node to the master node
* a hash over the LPT to the master node
* a flag to the filesystem flag indicating the filesystem is
  authenticated
* an authentication node necessary to authenticate the nodes written
  to the journal heads while they are written.
* a HMAC of a well known message to the super block node to be able
  to check if the correct key is provided

And finally, not visible in this patch, nevertheless explained here:

* hashes over the referenced child nodes in each branch of a index node
