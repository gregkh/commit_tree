dt-binding: arm/cpus.txt: fix dynamic-power-coefficient unit

The unit of dynamic-power-coefficient is described as mW/MHz/uV^2 whereas
its usage in the code assumes that unit is uW/MHz/V^2

In drivers/thermal/cpu_cooling.c, the code is :

power = (u64)capacitance * freq_mhz * voltage_mv * voltage_mv;
do_div(power, 1000000000);

which can be summarized as :
power (mW) = capacitance * freq_mhz/1000 * (voltage_mv/1000)^2
or
power (mW) = (capacitance * freq_mhz * (voltage_mv/1000)^2) / 1000
then
power (mW) = power (uW) / 1000
so
power (uW) = capacitance * freq_mhz * (voltage_mv/1000)^2

Furthermore, if we test basic values like :
voltage_mv = 1000mV = 1V
freq_mhz = 1000Mhz

The minimum possible power, when dynamic-power-coefficient equals 1, will
be with current unit:
min power = 1 * 1000  * (1000000)^2 = 10^15 mW
which is not realistic

With the unit used by the code, the min power is
min power =  1 * 1000 * 1^2 = 1000uW = 1mW which is far more realistic
