Revert "HID: add NOGET quirk for Eaton Ellipse MAX UPS"

This reverts commit 67ddbb3e6568fb1820b2cc45b00c50702b114801.

67ddbb3e656 ("HID: add NOGET quirk for Eaton Ellipse MAX UPS") was reported
by Laurent Bigonville. It turns out that a later model Laurent got
doesn't need the quirk after all.

My take is that Eaton upgraded their firmwares, so we don't need it
anymore.

The old model was from 2012, so better make sure the new line works
properly by removing the quirk. This allows upower to actually fetch
the current data.
