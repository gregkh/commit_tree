tipc: refactor function tipc_msg_reverse()

The function tipc_msg_reverse() is reversing the header of a message
while reusing the original buffer. We have seen at several occasions
that this may have unfortunate side effects when the buffer to be
reversed is a clone.

In one of the following commits we will again need to reverse cloned
buffers, so this is the right time to permanently eliminate this
problem. In this commit we let the said function always consume the
original buffer and replace it with a new one when applicable.
