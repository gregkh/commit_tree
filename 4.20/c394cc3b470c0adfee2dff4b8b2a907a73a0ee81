platform: goldfish: pipe: Move the file-scope goldfish_interrupt_tasklet variable into the driver state

This is a series of patches to move mutable file-scope variables
into the driver state. This change will help to introduce another
version of the pipe driver (with different state) for the older
host interface or having several instances of this device.
