x86/mm: Add vsyscall address helper

We will shortly be using this check in two locations.  Put it in
a helper before we do so.

Let's also insert PAGE_MASK instead of the open-coded ~0xfff.
It is easier to read and also more obviously correct considering
the implicit type conversion that has to happen when it is not
an implicit 'unsigned long'.
