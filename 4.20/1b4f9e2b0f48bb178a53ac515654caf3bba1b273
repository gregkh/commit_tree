nios2: use common rules to build built-in dtb

Using the common build support for built-in dtb files just requires
adding a .dtb.o target to obj-y.

This has the side effect that CONFIG_NIOS2_DTB_SOURCE should now be just
the dts filename in arch/nios2/boot/dts/ directory. Before any path was
supported, but if you want to build in your dtb to the kernel, it should
be in the kernel tree.
