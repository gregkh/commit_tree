binder: Add BINDER_GET_NODE_INFO_FOR_REF ioctl.

This allows the context manager to retrieve information about nodes
that it holds a reference to, such as the current number of
references to those nodes.

Such information can for example be used to determine whether the
servicemanager is the only process holding a reference to a node.
This information can then be passed on to the process holding the
node, which can in turn decide whether it wants to shut down to
reduce resource usage.
