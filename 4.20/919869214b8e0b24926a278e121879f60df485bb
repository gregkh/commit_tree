ASoC: tas6424: Print full register name in error message

The current short version of the register name may be
ambiguous when another fault register detection is added.
Use the full name.

While here fix comment about clearing faults, the CLEAR_FAULT
register actually only clears sticky bits, which are only
warnings, fault bits can only cleared by resolving the fault.
