ARM: cpuidle: Convert to use cpuidle_register|unregister()

The only reason that remains, to why the ARM cpuidle driver calls
cpuidle_register_driver(), is to avoid printing an error message in case
another driver already have been registered for the CPU. This seems a bit
silly, but more importantly, if that is a common scenario, perhaps we
should change cpuidle_register() accordingly instead.

In either case, let's consolidate the code, by converting to use
cpuidle_register|unregister(), which also avoids the unnecessary allocation
of the struct cpuidle_device.
