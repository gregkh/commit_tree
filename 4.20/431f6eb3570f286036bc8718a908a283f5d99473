SUNRPC: Add a label for RPC calls that require allocation on receive

If the RPC call relies on the receive call allocating pages as buffers,
then let's label it so that we
a) Don't leak memory by allocating pages for requests that do not expect
   this behaviour
b) Can optimise for the common case where calls do not require allocation.
