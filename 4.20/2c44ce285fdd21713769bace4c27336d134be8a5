signal/powerpc: Factor the common exception code into exception_common

It is brittle and wrong to populate si_pkey when there was not a pkey
exception.  The field does not exist for all si_codes and in some
cases another field exists in the same memory location.

So factor out the code that all exceptions handlers must run
into exception_common, leaving the individual exception handlers
to generate the signals themselves.
