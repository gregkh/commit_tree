userfaultfd: disable irqs when taking the waitqueue lock

userfaultfd contains howe-grown locking of the waitqueue lock, and does
not disable interrupts.  This relies on the fact that no one else takes it
from interrupt context and violates an invariat of the normal waitqueue
locking scheme.  With aio poll it is easy to trigger other locks that
disable interrupts (or are called from interrupt context).
