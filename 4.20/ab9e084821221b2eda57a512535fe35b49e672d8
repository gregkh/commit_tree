libbpf: Per-symbol visibility for DSO

Make global symbols in libbpf DSO hidden by default with
-fvisibility=hidden and export symbols that are part of ABI explicitly
with __attribute__((visibility("default"))).

This is common practice that should prevent from accidentally exporting
a symbol, that is not supposed to be a part of ABI what, in turn,
improves both libbpf developer- and user-experiences. See [1] for more
details.

Export control becomes more important since more and more projects use
libbpf.

The patch doesn't export a bunch of netlink related functions since as
agreed in [2] they'll be reworked. That doesn't break bpftool since
bpftool links libbpf statically.
