powerpc/pseries: Remove unneeded uses of dlpar work queue

There are three instances in which dlpar hotplug events are invoked;
handling a hotplug interrupt (in a kvm guest), handling a dlpar
request through sysfs, and updating LMB affinity when handling a
PRRN event. Only in the case of handling a hotplug interrupt do we
have to put the work on a workqueue, the other cases can handle the
dlpar request directly.

This patch exports the handle_dlpar_errorlog() function so that
dlpar hotplug events can be handled directly and updates the two
instances mentioned above to use the direct invocation.
