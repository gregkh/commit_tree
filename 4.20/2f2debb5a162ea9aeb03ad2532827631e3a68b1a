gpu: drm: radeon: si: Replace mdelay() with msleep() in si_pcie_gen3_enable()

si_pcie_gen3_enable() is never called in atomic context.
It calls mdelay() to busily wait, which is not necessary.
mdelay() can be replaced with msleep().

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself
