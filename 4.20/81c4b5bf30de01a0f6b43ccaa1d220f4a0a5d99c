PCI: hotplug: Constify hotplug_slot_ops

Hotplug drivers cannot declare their hotplug_slot_ops const, making them
attractive targets for attackers, because upon registration of a hotplug
slot, __pci_hp_initialize() writes to the "owner" and "mod_name" members
in that struct.

Fix by moving these members to struct hotplug_slot and constify every
driver's hotplug_slot_ops except for pciehp.

pciehp constructs its hotplug_slot_ops at runtime based on the PCIe
port's capabilities, hence cannot declare them const.  It can be
converted to __write_rarely once that's mainlined:
