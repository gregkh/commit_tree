dma-direct: Make DIRECT_MAPPING_ERROR viable for SWIOTLB

With the overflow buffer removed, we no longer have a unique address
which is guaranteed not to be a valid DMA target to use as an error
token. The DIRECT_MAPPING_ERROR value of 0 tries to at least represent
an unlikely DMA target, but unfortunately there are already SWIOTLB
users with DMA-able memory at physical address 0 which now gets falsely
treated as a mapping failure and leads to all manner of misbehaviour.

The best we can do to mitigate that is flip DIRECT_MAPPING_ERROR to the
other commonly-used error value of all-bits-set, since the last single
byte of memory is by far the least-likely-valid DMA target.
