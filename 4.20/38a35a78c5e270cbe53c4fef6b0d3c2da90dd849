xtensa: fix coprocessor part of ptrace_{get,set}xregs

Layout of coprocessor registers in the elf_xtregs_t and
xtregs_coprocessor_t may be different due to alignment. Thus it is not
always possible to copy data between the xtregs_coprocessor_t structure
and the elf_xtregs_t and get correct values for all registers.
Use a table of offsets and sizes of individual coprocessor register
groups to do coprocessor context copying in the ptrace_getxregs and
ptrace_setxregs.
This fixes incorrect coprocessor register values reading from the user
process by the native gdb on an xtensa core with multiple coprocessors
and registers with high alignment requirements.
