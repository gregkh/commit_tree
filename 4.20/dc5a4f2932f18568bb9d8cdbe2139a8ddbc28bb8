rcu: Switch ->dynticks to rcu_data structure, remove rcu_dynticks

This commit move ->dynticks from the rcu_dynticks structure to the
rcu_data structure, replacing the field of the same name.  It also updates
the code to access ->dynticks from the rcu_data structure and to use the
rcu_data structure rather than following to now-gone ->dynticks field
to the now-gone rcu_dynticks structure.  While in the area, this commit
also fixes up comments.
