spi: gpio: No MISO does not imply no RX

There is a logical problem in spi-gpio with host just
assigning a MOSI line and no MISO: this is interpreted
as the host cannot do RX and the host is flagged with
SPI_MASTER_NO_RX.

This is wrong: since GPIO lines can switch direction,
in 3WIRE operation the host will simply reverse the
direction of the GPIO line and start reading from it,
there is even code for doing this in the driver, but
it went unnoticed because it was tested by using a
master with 4 wires but a device using just 3 wires.

Remove the offending flag.
