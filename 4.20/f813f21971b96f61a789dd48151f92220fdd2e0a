mm/hmm: fix utf8 ...

Patch series "HMM updates, improvements and fixes", v2

Few fixes that only affect HMM users.  Improve the synchronization call
back so that we match was other mmu_notifier listener do and add proper
support to the new blockable flags in the process.

For curious folks here are branches to leverage HMM in various existing
device drivers:

https://cgit.freedesktop.org/~glisse/linux/log/?h=hmm-nouveau-v01
https://cgit.freedesktop.org/~glisse/linux/log/?h=hmm-radeon-v00
https://cgit.freedesktop.org/~glisse/linux/log/?h=hmm-intel-v00

More to come (amd gpu, Mellanox, ...)

I expect more of the preparatory work for nouveau will be merge in 4.20
(like we have been doing since 4.16) and i will wait until this patchset
is upstream before pushing the patches that actualy make use of HMM (to
avoid complex tree inter-dependency).

This patch (of 6):

Somehow utf=8 must have been broken.
