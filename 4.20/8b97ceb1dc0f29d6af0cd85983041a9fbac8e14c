ice: Enable firmware logging during device initialization.

To enable FW logging, the "cq_en" and "uart_en" enable bits of the
"fw_log" element in struct ice_hw need to set accordingly based on
some user-provided parameters during driver loading. To select which
FW log events to be emitted, the "cfg" elements of corresponding FW
modules in the "evnts" array member of "fw_log" need to be configured.
