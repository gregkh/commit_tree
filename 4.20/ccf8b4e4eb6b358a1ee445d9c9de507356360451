ARM: dts: NSP: Wire up switch interrupts

The Switch Register Access Block (SRAB) has one interrupt for link state
change on each ports (0-5, 7-8) a PHY interrupt, timestamping interrupt
and sleep timer interrupts for each management ports (5,7,8). Wire those
up so we can utilize them to speed up link resolution.
