powerpc/eeh: Cleanup field names in eeh_rmv_data

Change the name of the fields in eeh_rmv_data to clarify their usage.

Change "edev_list" to "removed_vf_list" because it does not contain
generic edevs, but rather only edevs that contain virtual functions
(which need to be removed during recovery).

Similarly, change "removed" to "removed_dev_count" because it is a
count of any removed devices, not just those in the above list.
