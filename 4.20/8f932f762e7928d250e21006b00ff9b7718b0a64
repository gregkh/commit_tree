net: add missing SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_ID support

SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_ID is supported on TCP, UDP and RAW sockets.
But it was missing on RAW with IPPROTO_IP, PF_PACKET and CAN.

Add skb_setup_tx_timestamp that configures both tx_flags and tskey
for these paths that do not need corking or use bytestream keys.
