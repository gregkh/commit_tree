gigaset: asyncdata: mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases
where we are expecting to fall through.

Notice that in this particular case, I replaced the
" --v-- fall through --v-- " comment with a proper
"fall through", which is what GCC is expecting to find.
