kvm: x86: Add has_payload and payload to kvm_queued_exception

The payload associated with a #PF exception is the linear address of
the fault to be loaded into CR2 when the fault is delivered. The
payload associated with a #DB exception is a mask of the DR6 bits to
be set (or in the case of DR6.RTM, cleared) when the fault is
delivered. Add fields has_payload and payload to kvm_queued_exception
to track payloads for pending exceptions.

The new fields are introduced here, but for now, they are just cleared.
