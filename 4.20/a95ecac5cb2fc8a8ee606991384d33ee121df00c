selftests/powerpc: Relax L1d miss targets for rfi_flush test

When running the rfi_flush test, if the system is loaded, we see two
issues:
1. The L1d misses when rfi_flush is disabled increase significantly due
to other workloads interfering with the cache.
2. The L1d misses when rfi_flush is enabled sometimes goes slightly
below the expected number of misses.

To address these, let's relax the expected number of L1d misses:
1. When rfi_flush is disabled, we allow upto half the expected number of
the misses for when rfi_flush is enabled.
2. When rfi_flush is enabled, we allow ~1% lower number of cache misses.
