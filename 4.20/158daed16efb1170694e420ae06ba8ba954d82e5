i40e: fix mac filter delete when setting mac address

A previous commit moved the ether_addr_copy() in i40e_set_mac() before
the mac filter del/add to avoid a race. However it wasn't taken into
account that this alters the mac address being handed to
i40e_del_mac_filter().

Also changed i40e_add_mac_filter() to operate on netdev->dev_addr,
hopefully that makes the code easier to read.

Fixes: 458867b2ca0c ("i40e: don't remove netdev->dev_addr when syncing uc list")
