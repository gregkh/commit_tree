kvm: arm64: Configure VTCR_EL2 per VM

Add support for setting the VTCR_EL2 per VM, rather than hard
coding a value at boot time per CPU. This would allow us to tune
the stage2 page table parameters per VM in the later changes.

We compute the VTCR fields based on the system wide sanitised
feature registers, except for the hardware management of Access
Flags (VTCR_EL2.HA). It is fine to run a system with a mix of
CPUs that may or may not update the page table Access Flags.
Since the bit is RES0 on CPUs that don't support it, the bit
should be ignored on them.
