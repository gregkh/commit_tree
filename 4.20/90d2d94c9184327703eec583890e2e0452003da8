iwlwifi: mvm: remove RECONFIGURING queue state

We set the queue to this state, only to pretty much immediately
move it out of it again. However, we can't even hit any of the
code that checks if the queue is reconfiguring, because all of
this happens under mvm->mutex and we hold the all the way from
marking the queue as RECONFIGURING to marking it as READY again.

Additionally, the queue that became RECONFIGURING would've been
in SHARED state before, and it can safely stay in that state. In
case of errors, it previously would have stayed in RECONFIGURING
which it could never have left again.

Remove the state entirely and just track the queues that need to
be reconfigured in a separate, local, bitmap.
