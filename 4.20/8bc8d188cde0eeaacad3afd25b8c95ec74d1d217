ice: Update comment for ice_fltr_mgmt_list_entry

Previously the comment stated that VSI lists should be used when a
second VSI becomes a subscriber to the "VLAN address". VSI lists
are always used for VLAN membership, so replace "VLAN address" with
"MAC address". Also note that VLAN(s) always use VSI list rules.
