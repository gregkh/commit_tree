block: Schedule runtime resume earlier

Instead of scheduling runtime resume of a request queue after a
request has been queued, schedule asynchronous resume during request
allocation. The new pm_request_resume() calls occur after
blk_queue_enter() has increased the q_usage_counter request queue
member. This change is needed for a later patch that will make request
allocation block while the queue status is not RPM_ACTIVE.
