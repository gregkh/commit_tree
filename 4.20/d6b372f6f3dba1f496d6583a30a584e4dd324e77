Bluetooth: ath3k: add more information to error message

When there is an error in either ath3k_load_firmware() or
ath3k_load_fwfile(), the inlined function ath3k_log_failed_loading() is
called receiving the error returned and both the block size requested to
load and the size actually loaded. These values are printed in an error
message using the macro BT_ERR.

This patch changes that function in order to print the variable "count"
as well, to show more information when a failing firmware loading
operation happens. The calls to the older function were changed to the
new one.

This event is being monitored in a laptop with an adapter which
identifies itself as 0cf3:0036, where sometimes there are errors in the
firmware loading process.
