staging: erofs: code cleanup for option parsing of fault_injection

Define a dummpy function of erofs_build_fault_attr() when macro
CONFIG_EROFS_FAULT_INJECTION is disabled, so that we don't have to
check the macro in calling place. Based on above adjustment,
do proper code cleanup for option parsing of fault_injection.
