net/mlx5e: Fix a bug in turning off FEC policy in unsupported speeds

Some speeds don't support turning FEC policy off. In case a requested
FEC policy is not supported for a speed (including current speed), its new
FEC policy would be:
	no FEC - if disabling FEC is supported for that speed
	unchanged - else
