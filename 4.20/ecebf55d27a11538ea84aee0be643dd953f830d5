ext2: fix potential use after free

The function ext2_xattr_set calls brelse(bh) to drop the reference count
of bh. After that, bh may be freed. However, following brelse(bh),
it reads bh->b_data via macro HDR(bh). This may result in a
use-after-free bug. This patch moves brelse(bh) after reading field.
