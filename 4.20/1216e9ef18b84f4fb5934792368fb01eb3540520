nvmet-fcloop: suppress a compiler warning

Building with W=1 enables the compiler warning -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3. That
option does not recognize the fall-through comment in the fcloop driver. Add
a fall-through comment that is recognized for -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3. This
patch avoids that the compiler reports the following warning when building
with W=1:

drivers/nvme/target/fcloop.c:647:6: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
   if (op == NVMET_FCOP_READDATA)
      ^
