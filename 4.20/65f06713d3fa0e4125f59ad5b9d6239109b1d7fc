s390: vfio-ap: register matrix device with VFIO mdev framework

Registers the matrix device created by the VFIO AP device
driver with the VFIO mediated device framework.
Registering the matrix device will create the sysfs
structures needed to create mediated matrix devices
each of which will be used to configure the AP matrix
for a guest and connect it to the VFIO AP device driver.

Registering the matrix device with the VFIO mediated device
framework will create the following sysfs structures:

/sys/devices/vfio_ap/matrix/
...... [mdev_supported_types]
......... [vfio_ap-passthrough]
............ create

To create a mediated device for the AP matrix device, write a UUID
to the create file:

	uuidgen > create

A symbolic link to the mediated device's directory will be created in the
devices subdirectory named after the generated $uuid:

/sys/devices/vfio_ap/matrix/
...... [mdev_supported_types]
......... [vfio_ap-passthrough]
............ [devices]
............... [$uuid]

A symbolic link to the mediated device will also be created
in the vfio_ap matrix's directory:

/sys/devices/vfio_ap/matrix/[$uuid]
