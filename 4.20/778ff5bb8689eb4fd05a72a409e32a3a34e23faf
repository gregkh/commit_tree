ASoC: dapm: Move connection of CODEC to CODEC DAIs

Currently, snd_soc_dapm_connect_dai_link_widgets connects up the routes
representing normal DAIs, however CODEC to CODEC links are hooked up
through separate infrastructure in soc_link_dai_widgets. Improve the
consistency of the code by using snd_soc_dapm_connect_dai_link for both
types of DAIs.
