nvme-core: make implicit seed truncation explicit

The nvme_user_io.slba field is 64 bits wide. That value is copied into the
32-bit bio_integrity_payload.bip_iter.bi_sector field. Make that truncation
explicit to avoid that Coverity complains about implicit truncation. See
also Coverity ID 1056486 on http://scan.coverity.com/projects/linux.
