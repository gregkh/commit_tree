flow_dissector: lookup netns by skb->sk if skb->dev is NULL

BPF flow dissectors are configured per network namespace.
__skb_flow_dissect looks up the netns through dev_net(skb->dev).

In some dissector paths skb->dev is NULL, such as for Unix sockets.
In these cases fall back to looking up the netns by socket.

Analyzing the codepaths leading to __skb_flow_dissect I did not find
a case where both skb->dev and skb->sk are NULL. Warn and fall back to
standard flow dissector if one is found.
