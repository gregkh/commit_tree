Revert "ceph: fix dentry leak in splice_dentry()"

This reverts commit 8b8f53af1ed9df88a4c0fbfdf3db58f62060edf3.

splice_dentry() is used by three places. For two places, req->r_dentry
is passed to splice_dentry(). In the case of error, req->r_dentry does
not get updated. So splice_dentry() should not drop reference.
