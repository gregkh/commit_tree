RDMA/cma: Introduce and use cma_ib_acquire_dev()

When RDMA CM connect request arrives for IB transport, it already contains
device, port, netdevice (optional).

Instead of traversing all the cma devices, use the cma device already
found by the cma_find_listener() for which a listener id is provided.

iWarp devices doesn't need to derive RoCE GIDs, therefore drop RoCE
specific checks from cma_acquire_dev() and rename it to
cma_iw_acquire_dev().
