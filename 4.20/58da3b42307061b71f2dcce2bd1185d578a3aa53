ath10k: skip resetting rx filter for WCN3990

WCN3990 has the MAC_PCU_ADDR1 configured properly
and hence it will not send spurious ack frames
during boot up.

Hence the reset_rx_filter workaround is not needed
for WCN3990. Add a hw_param to indicate if hardware rx
filter reset is needed and skip the reset_rx_filter for
WCN3990.

Tested HW: WCN3990
Tested FW: WLAN.HL.2.0-01188-QCAHLSWMTPLZ-1
