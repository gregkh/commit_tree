reset: hisilicon: fix potential NULL pointer dereference

There is a potential execution path in which function
platform_get_resource() returns NULL. If this happens,
we will end up having a NULL pointer dereference.

Fix this by replacing devm_ioremap with devm_ioremap_resource,
which has the NULL check and the memory region request.

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
