drm/vmwgfx: Look up objects without taking a reference

Typically when we look up objects under the rcu lock, we take a reference
to make sure the returned object pointer is valid.
Now provide a function to look up an object and instead of taking a
reference to it, keep the rcu lock held when returning the object pointer.
This means that the object pointer is valid as long as the rcu lock is
held, but the object may be doomed (its refcount may be zero). Any
persistent usage of the object pointer outside of the rcu lock requires
a reference to be taken using kref_get_unless_zero().
