octeontx2-af: Broadcast packet replication support

Allocate memory for mcast/bcast/mirror replication entry
contexts, replication buffers (used by HW) and config HW
with corresponding memory bases. Added support for installing
MCEs via NIX AQ mbox.

For now support is restricted to broadcast pkt replication,
hence MCE table size and number of replication buffers
allocated are less. Each CGX LMAC mapped RVU PF is assigned
a MCE table of size 'num VFs of that PF + PF'.
