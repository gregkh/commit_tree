netlink: remove hash::nelems check in netlink_insert

The type of hash::nelems has been changed from size_t to atom_t
which in fact is int, so not need to check if BITS_PER_LONG, that
is bit number of size_t, is bigger than 32

and rht_grow_above_max() will be called to check if hashtable is
too big, ensure it can not bigger than 1<<31
