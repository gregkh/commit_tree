i40e: Remove unnecessary print statement

Clang warns that the address of a pointer will always evaluated as true
in a boolean context.

drivers/net/ethernet/intel/i40e/i40e_debugfs.c:136:9: warning: address
of array 'vsi->active_vlans' will always evaluate to 'true'
[-Wpointer-bool-conversion]
                 vsi->active_vlans ? "<valid>" : "<null>");
                 ~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~ ~
./include/linux/device.h:1431:33: note: expanded from macro 'dev_info'
        _dev_info(dev, dev_fmt(fmt), ##__VA_ARGS__)
                                       ^~~~~~~~~~~
1 warning generated.

Given that the statement shows that active_vlans is always valid, just
remove the statement since it's not giving any useful information.
