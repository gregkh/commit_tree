media: vicodec: add support for more pixel formats

Add support for 4:2:2, 4:4:4 and RGB 24/32 bits formats.

This makes it a lot more useful, esp. as a simple video compression
codec for use with v4l2-ctl/qvidcap.

Note that it does not do any conversion between e.g. 4:2:2 and 4:2:0
or RGB and YUV: it still just compresses planes be they Y/U/V or R/G/B.
