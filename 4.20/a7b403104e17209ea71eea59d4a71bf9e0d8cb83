xen/x86: add diagnostic printout to xen_mc_flush() in case of error

Failure of an element of a Xen multicall is signalled via a WARN()
only if the kernel is compiled with MC_DEBUG. It is impossible to
know which element failed and why it did so.

Change that by printing the related information even without MC_DEBUG,
even if maybe in some limited form (e.g. without information which
caller produced the failing element).

Move the printing out of the switch statement in order to have the
same information for a single call.
