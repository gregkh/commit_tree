rcu: Remove RCU_STATE_INITIALIZER()

Now that a given build of the Linux kernel has only one set of rcu_state,
rcu_node, and rcu_data structures, there is no point in creating a macro
to declare and compile-time initialize them.  This commit therefore
just does normal declaration and compile-time initialization of these
structures.  While in the area, this commit also removes #ifndefs of
the no-longer-ever-defined preprocessor macro RCU_TREE_NONCORE.
