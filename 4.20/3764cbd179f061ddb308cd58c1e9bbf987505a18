cifs: remove the is_falloc argument to SMB2_set_eof

We never pass is_falloc==true here anyway and if we ever need to support
is_falloc in the future, SMB2_set_eof is such a trivial wrapper around
send_set_info() that we can/should just create a differently named wrapper
for that new functionality.
