iio:st_magn: Fix enable device after trigger

Currently, we enable the device before we enable the device trigger. At
high frequencies, this can cause interrupts that don't yet have a poll
function associated with them and are thus treated as spurious. At high
frequencies with level interrupts, this can even cause an interrupt storm
of repeated spurious interrupts (~100,000 on my Beagleboard with the
LSM9DS1 magnetometer). If these repeat too much, the interrupt will get
disabled and the device will stop functioning.

To prevent these problems, enable the device prior to enabling the device
trigger, and disable the divec prior to disabling the trigger. This means
there's no window of time during which the device creates interrupts but we
have no trigger to answer them.
