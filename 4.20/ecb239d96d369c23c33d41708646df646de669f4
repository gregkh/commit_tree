ethernet: fman: fix wrong of_node_put() in probe function

After getting a reference to the platform device's of_node the probe
function ends up calling of_find_matching_node() using the node as an
argument. The function takes care of decreasing the refcount on it. We
are then incorrectly decreasing the refcount on that node again.

This patch removes the unwarranted call to of_node_put().
