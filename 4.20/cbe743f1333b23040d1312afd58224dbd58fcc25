usb: usbtmc: Fix ioctl USBTMC_IOCTL_ABORT_BULK_IN

Add parameter 'tag' to function usbtmc_ioctl_abort_bulk_in_tag()
for future versions.

Remove calculation of max_size (=wMaxPacketSize) and wrong
condition (actual == max_size) in while loop. An abort operation
should always flush the complete Bulk-IN until a short packet is
received.

Return error code ENOMSG when transfer (specified by given tag)
is not in progress and device returns code
USBTMC_STATUS_TRANSFER_NOT_IN_PROGRESS.

Use USBTMC_BUFSIZE (4k) instead of USBTMC_SIZE_IOBUFFER (2k).
Using USBTMC_SIZE_IOBUFFER is deprecated.

Use common macro USB_CTRL_GET_TIMEOUT instead of USBTMC_TIMEOUT.

Check only bit 0 (field bmAbortBulkIn) of the
CHECK_ABORT_BULK_IN_STATUS response, since other bits are reserved
and can change in future versions.
