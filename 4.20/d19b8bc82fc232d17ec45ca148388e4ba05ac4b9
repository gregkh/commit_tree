nvme-fc: fix request private initialization

The patch made to avoid Coverity reporting of out of bounds access
on aen_op moved the assignment of a pointer, leaving it null when it
was subsequently used to calculate a private pointer. Thus the private
pointer was bad.

Move/correct the private pointer initialization to be in sync with the
patch.
