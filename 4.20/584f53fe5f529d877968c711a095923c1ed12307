scsi: hisi_sas: Fix the race between IO completion and timeout for SMP/internal IO

If SMP/internal IO times out, we will possibly free the task immediately.

However if the IO actually completes at the same time, the IO completion
may refer to task which has been freed.

So to solve the issue, flush the tasklet to finish IO completion before
free'ing slot/task.
