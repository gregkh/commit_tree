x86-32, hibernate: Switch to relocated restore code during resume on 32bit system

On 64bit system, code should be executed in a safe page
during page restoring, as the page where instruction is
running during resume might be scribbled and causes issues.

Although on 32 bit, we only suspend resuming by same kernel
that did the suspend, we'd like to remove that restriction
in the future.

Porting corresponding code from
64bit system: Allocate a safe page, and copy the restore
code to it, then jump to the safe page to run the code.
