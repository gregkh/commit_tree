mm/memcontrol.c: convert mem_cgroup_id::ref to refcount_t type

This will allow to use generic refcount_t interfaces to check counters
overflow instead of currently existing VM_BUG_ON().  The only difference
after the patch is VM_BUG_ON() may cause BUG(), while refcount_t fires
with WARN().  But this seems not to be significant here, since such the
problems are usually caught by syzbot with panic-on-warn enabled.
