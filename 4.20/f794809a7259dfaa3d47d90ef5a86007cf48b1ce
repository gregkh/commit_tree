IB/core: Add an unbound WQ type to the new CQ API

The upstream kernel commit cited below modified the workqueue in the
new CQ API to be bound to a specific CPU (instead of being unbound).
This caused ALL users of the new CQ API to use the same bound WQ.

Specifically, MAD handling was severely delayed when the CPU bound
to the WQ was busy handling (higher priority) interrupts.

This caused a delay in the MAD "heartbeat" response handling,
which resulted in ports being incorrectly classified as "down".

To fix this, add a new "unbound" WQ type to the new CQ API, so that users
have the option to choose either a bound WQ or an unbound WQ.

For MADs, choose the new "unbound" WQ.
