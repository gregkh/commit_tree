kgdboc: Fix restrict error

There's an error when compiled with restrict:

drivers/tty/serial/kgdboc.c: In function ‘configure_kgdboc’:
drivers/tty/serial/kgdboc.c:137:2: error: ‘strcpy’ source argument is the same
as destination [-Werror=restrict]
  strcpy(config, opt);
  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the error implies, this is from trying to use config as both source and
destination. Drop the call to the function where config is the argument
since nothing else happens in the function.
