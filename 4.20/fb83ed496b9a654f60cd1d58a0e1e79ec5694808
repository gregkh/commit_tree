tipc: compare remote and local protocols in tipc_udp_enable()

When TIPC_NLA_UDP_REMOTE is an IPv6 mcast address but
TIPC_NLA_UDP_LOCAL is an IPv4 address, a NULL-ptr deref is triggered
as the UDP tunnel sock is initialized to IPv4 or IPv6 sock merely
based on the protocol in local address.

We should just error out when the remote address and local address
have different protocols.
