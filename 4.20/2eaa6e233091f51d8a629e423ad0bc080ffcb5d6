ASoC: rsnd: tidyup SSICR::SWSP for TDM

R-Car datasheet is indicating that WS output settings of SSICR::SWSP
is inverted on TDM mode from non TDM mode settings.
But, it is meaning that TDM should use 0 here.
Without this patch, sound input/output 1ch will be 2ch, 2ch will be 3ch
..., be jumbled on I2S + TDM settings. This patch fixup it.
This patch is tested on R-Car H3 ulcb-kf board, SSI3/4 TDM sound.
