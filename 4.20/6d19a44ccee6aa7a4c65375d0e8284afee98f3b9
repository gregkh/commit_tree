drm/i915: s/tile_offset/aligned_offset/ etc.

Rename some of the tile_offset() functions to aligned_offset() since
they operate on both linear and tiled functions. And we'll include
_plane_ in the name of all the variants that take a plane state.
Should make it more clear which function to use where.
