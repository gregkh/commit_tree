net/mlx5e: For TC offloads, always add new flow instead of appending the actions

When replacing a tc flower rule, flower first requests to add the
new rule (new action), then deletes the old one.
But currently when asked to add a new tc flower flow, we append the
actions (and counters to it).

This can result in a fte with two flow counters or conflicting
actions (drop and encap action) which firmware complains/errs
about and isn't achieving what the user aimed for.

Instead, insert the flow using the new no-append flag which will add a
new HW rule, the old flow and rule will be deleted later by flower
