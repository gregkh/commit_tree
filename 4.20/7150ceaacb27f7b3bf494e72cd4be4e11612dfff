rxrpc: Fix life check

The life-checking function, which is used by kAFS to make sure that a call
is still live in the event of a pending signal, only samples the received
packet serial number counter; it doesn't actually provoke a change in the
counter, rather relying on the server to happen to give us a packet in the
time window.

Fix this by adding a function to force a ping to be transmitted.

kAFS then keeps track of whether there's been a stall, and if so, uses the
new function to ping the server, resetting the timeout to allow the reply
to come back.

If there's a stall, a ping and the call is *still* stalled in the same
place after another period, then the call will be aborted.
