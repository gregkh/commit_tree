ASoC: soc-core: add snd_soc_is_matching_component()

To find (CPU/)Codec/Platform, we need to find component first
(= on CPU/Codec/Platform), and find DAI from it (= CPU/Codec).
These are similar operation but difficult to be simple,
and has many duplicate code to finding component.
This patch adds new snd_soc_is_matching_component(),
and reduce duplicate codes.
