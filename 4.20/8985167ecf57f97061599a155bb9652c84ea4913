clk: s2mps11: Fix matching when built as module and DT node contains compatible

When driver is built as module and DT node contains clocks compatible
(e.g. "samsung,s2mps11-clk"), the module will not be autoloaded because
module aliases won't match.

The modalias from uevent: of:NclocksT<NULL>Csamsung,s2mps11-clk
The modalias from driver: platform:s2mps11-clk

The devices are instantiated by parent's MFD.  However both Device Tree
bindings and parent define the compatible for clocks devices.  In case
of module matching this DT compatible will be used.

The issue will not happen if this is a built-in (no need for module
matching) or when clocks DT node does not contain compatible (not
correct from bindings perspective but working for driver).

Note when backporting to stable kernels: adjust the list of device ID
entries.
