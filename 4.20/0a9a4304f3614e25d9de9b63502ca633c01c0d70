SUNRPC: Fix a potential race in xprt_connect()

If an asynchronous connection attempt completes while another task is
in xprt_connect(), then the call to rpc_sleep_on() could end up
racing with the call to xprt_wake_pending_tasks().
So add a second test of the connection state after we've put the
task to sleep and set the XPRT_CONNECTING flag, when we know that there
can be no asynchronous connection attempts still in progress.
