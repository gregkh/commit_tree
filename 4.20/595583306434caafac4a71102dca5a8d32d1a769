kvm: arm64: Dynamic configuration of VTTBR mask

On arm64 VTTBR_EL2:BADDR holds the base address for the stage2
translation table. The Arm ARM mandates that the bits BADDR[x-1:0]
should be 0, where 'x' is defined for a given IPA Size and the
number of levels for a translation granule size. It is defined
using some magical constants. This patch is a reverse engineered
implementation to calculate the 'x' at runtime for a given ipa and
number of page table levels. See patch for more details.
