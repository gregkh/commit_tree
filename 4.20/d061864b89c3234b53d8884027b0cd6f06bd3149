ARM: dt: relicense two DT binding IRQ headers

Files in include/dt-bindings/ may be useful to any OS that uses DT, when
building the OS binary itself, not just when building DTB files. Since
some OSs are not GPL, they need non-GPL headers. This change relicenses
two of the useful files so that they can be used under the MIT license
when desired. I wrote these files and NVIDIA legal has approved this
change. Geert also ack'd the change; he fixed some spelling issues in the
comments.
