cpuidle: menu: Avoid computations for very close timers

If the next timer event (not including the tick) is closer than the
target residency of the second state or the PM QoS latency constraint
is below its exit latency, state[0] will be used regardless of any
other factors, so skip the computations in menu_select() then and
return 0 straight away from it.

Still, do that after the bucket has been determined to avoid
updating the correction factor for a stale bucket.
