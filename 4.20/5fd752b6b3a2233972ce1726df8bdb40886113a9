leds: core: Introduce LED pattern trigger

This patch adds a new LED trigger that LED device can configure
to employ software or hardware pattern engine.

Consumers can write 'pattern' file to enable the software pattern
which alters the brightness for the specified duration with one
software timer.

Moreover consumers can write 'hw_pattern' file to enable the hardware
pattern for some LED controllers which can autonomously control
brightness over time, according to some preprogrammed hardware
patterns.
