bus: ti-sysc: Defer suspend as needed

We don't care when we suspend but some our children do. In order to
avoid tagging various modules with SYSC_QUIRK_RESOURCE_PROVIDER, let's
do it automatically by tagging modules that are busy on suspend for
noirq suspend. This way we can just do module detection on define DEBUG.

Note that we still need to keep SYSC_QUIRK_LEGACY_IDLE flag around so
the our legacy single-child devices that set pm_runtime_irq_safe() can
manage the interconnect target module themselves.
