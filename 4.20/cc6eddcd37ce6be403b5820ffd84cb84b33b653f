media: v4l2-dev: lock req_queue_mutex

We need to serialize streamon/off with queueing new requests.
These ioctls may trigger the cancellation of a streaming
operation, and that should not be mixed with queuing a new
request at the same time.

Finally close() needs this lock since that too can trigger the
cancellation of a streaming operation.

We take the req_queue_mutex here before any other locks since
it is a very high-level lock.
