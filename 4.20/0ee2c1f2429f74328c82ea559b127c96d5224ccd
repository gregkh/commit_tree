PCI: imx: Initial imx7d pm support

On imx7d the pcie-phy power domain is turned off in suspend and this can
make the system hang after resume when attempting any read from PCI.

Fix this by adding minimal suspend/resume code. This will prepare for
powering down on suspend and reset the block on resume.

Code is only for imx7d but a very similar sequence can be used for
other SOCs.
