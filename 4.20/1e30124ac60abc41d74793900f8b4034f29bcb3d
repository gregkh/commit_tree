ACPI / LPSS: Make acpi_lpss_find_device() also find PCI devices

On some Cherry Trail systems the GPU ACPI fwnode has power-resources which
point to the PMIC, which is connected over one of the LPSS I2C controllers.

To get the suspend/resume ordering correct for this we need to be able to
add device-links between the GPU and the I2c controller. The GPU is a PCI
device, so this requires acpi_lpss_find_device() to also work on PCI devs.
