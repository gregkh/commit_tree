md/bitmap: use mddev_suspend/resume instead of ->quiesce()

After 9e1cc0a54556 ("md: use mddev_suspend/resume instead of ->quiesce()")
We still have similar left in bitmap functions.

Replace quiesce() with mddev_suspend/resume.

Also move md_bitmap_create out of mddev_suspend. and move mddev_resume
after md_bitmap_destroy. as we did in set_bitmap_file.
