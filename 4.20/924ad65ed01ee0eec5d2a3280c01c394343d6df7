tls: replace poll implementation with read hook

Instead of re-implementing poll routine use the poll callback to
trigger read from kTLS, we reuse the stream_memory_read callback
which is simpler and achieves the same. This helps to align sockmap
and kTLS so we can more easily embed BPF in kTLS.

Joint work with Daniel.
