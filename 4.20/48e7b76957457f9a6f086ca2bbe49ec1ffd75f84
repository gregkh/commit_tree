powerpc/64s/hash: Convert SLB miss handlers to C

This patch moves SLB miss handlers completely to C, using the standard
exception handler macros to set up the stack and branch to C.

This can be done because the segment containing the kernel stack is
always bolted, so accessing it with relocation on will not cause an
SLB exception.

Arbitrary kernel memory must not be accessed when handling kernel
space SLB misses, so care should be taken there. However user SLB
misses can access any kernel memory, which can be used to move some
fields out of the paca (in later patches).

User SLB misses could quite easily reconcile IRQs and set up a first
class kernel environment and exit via ret_from_except, however that
doesn't seem to be necessary at the moment, so we only do that if a
bad fault is encountered.
