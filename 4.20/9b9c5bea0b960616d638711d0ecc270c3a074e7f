cifs: do not return atime less than mtime

In network file system it is fairly easy for server and client
atime vs. mtime to get confused (and atime updated less frequently)
which we noticed broke some apps which expect atime >= mtime

Also ignore relatime mount option (rather than error on it) since
relatime is basically what some network server fs are doing
(relatime).
