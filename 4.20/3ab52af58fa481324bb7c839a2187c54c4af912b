i40e: disallow changing the number of descriptors when AF_XDP is on

When an AF_XDP UMEM is attached to any of the Rx rings, we disallow a
user to change the number of descriptors via e.g. "ethtool -G IFNAME".

Otherwise, the size of the stash/reuse queue can grow unbounded, which
would result in OOM or leaking userspace buffers.
