drm: add LG eDP panel to quirk database

The N value was computed by kernel driver that based on synchronous clock
mode. But only specific N value (0x8000) would be acceptable for
LG LP140WF6-SPM1 eDP panel which is running at asynchronous clock mode.
With the other N value, Tcon will enter BITS mode and display black screen.
Add this panel into quirk database and give particular N value when
calculate M/N divider.

v2: no update
v3: add lost commit messages back for version 2
v4: send patch to both intel-gfx and dri-devel
