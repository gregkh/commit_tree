powerpc/eeh: Cleanup eeh_pe_state_mark()

Currently, eeh_pe_state_mark() marks a PE (and it's children) with a
state and then performs additional processing if that state included
EEH_PE_ISOLATED.

The state parameter is always a constant at the call site, so
rearrange eeh_pe_state_mark() into two functions and just call the
appropriate one at each site.
