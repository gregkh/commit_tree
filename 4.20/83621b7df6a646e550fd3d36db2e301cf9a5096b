net/mlx5e: Always use the match level enum when parsing TC rule match

We get the match level (none, l2, l3, l4) while going over the match
dissectors of an offloaded tc rule. When doing this, the match level
enum and the not min inline enum values should be used, fix that.

This worked accidentally b/c both enums have the same numerical values.
