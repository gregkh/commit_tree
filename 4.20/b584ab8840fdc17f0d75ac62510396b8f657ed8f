selftests/bpf: Add tests for reference tracking

reference tracking: leak potential reference
reference tracking: leak potential reference on stack
reference tracking: leak potential reference on stack 2
reference tracking: zero potential reference
reference tracking: copy and zero potential references
reference tracking: release reference without check
reference tracking: release reference
reference tracking: release reference twice
reference tracking: release reference twice inside branch
reference tracking: alloc, check, free in one subbranch
reference tracking: alloc, check, free in both subbranches
reference tracking in call: free reference in subprog
reference tracking in call: free reference in subprog and outside
reference tracking in call: alloc & leak reference in subprog
reference tracking in call: alloc in subprog, release outside
reference tracking in call: sk_ptr leak into caller stack
reference tracking in call: sk_ptr spill into caller stack
reference tracking: allow LD_ABS
reference tracking: forbid LD_ABS while holding reference
reference tracking: allow LD_IND
reference tracking: forbid LD_IND while holding reference
reference tracking: check reference or tail call
reference tracking: release reference then tail call
reference tracking: leak possible reference over tail call
reference tracking: leak checked reference over tail call
reference tracking: mangle and release sock_or_null
reference tracking: mangle and release sock
reference tracking: access member
reference tracking: write to member
reference tracking: invalid 64-bit access of member
reference tracking: access after release
reference tracking: direct access for lookup
unpriv: spill/fill of different pointers stx - ctx and sock
unpriv: spill/fill of different pointers stx - leak sock
unpriv: spill/fill of different pointers stx - sock and ctx (read)
unpriv: spill/fill of different pointers stx - sock and ctx (write)
