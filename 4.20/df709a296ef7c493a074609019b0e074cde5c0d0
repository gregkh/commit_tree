KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Simplify real-mode interrupt handling

This streamlines the first part of the code that handles a hypervisor
interrupt that occurred in the guest.  With this, all of the real-mode
handling that occurs is done before the "guest_exit_cont" label; once
we get to that label we are committed to exiting to host virtual mode.
Thus the machine check and HMI real-mode handling is moved before that
label.

Also, the code to handle external interrupts is moved out of line, as
is the code that calls kvmppc_realmode_hmi_handler().
