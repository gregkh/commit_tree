cpuidle: menu: Replace data->predicted_us with local variable

The predicted_us field in struct menu_device is only accessed in
menu_select(), so replace it with a local variable in that function.

With that, stop using expected_interval instead of predicted_us to
store the new predicted idle duration value if it is set to the
selected state's target residency which is quite confusing.
