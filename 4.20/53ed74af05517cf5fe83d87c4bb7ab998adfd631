x86/intel_rdt: Re-enable pseudo-lock measurements

Commit 4a7a54a55e72 ("x86/intel_rdt: Disable PMU access") disabled
measurements of pseudo-locked regions because of incorrect usage
of the performance monitoring hardware.

Cache pseudo-locking measurements are now done correctly with the
in-kernel perf API and its use can be re-enabled at this time.

The adjustment to the in-kernel perf API also separated the L2 and L3
measurements that can be triggered separately from user space. The
re-enabling of the measurements is thus not a simple revert of the
original disable in order to accommodate the additional parameter
possible.
