staging: greybus: loopback.c: remove unused gb_loopback::lbid

It's not obvious how the code prevents adding more than 31 elements to
the list and thus invoking undefined behaviour in the 1 << new_lbid
expression, and in practice causing ->lbid values to repeat every 32
elements.

But the definition of struct gb_loopback is local to loopback.c, and the
lbid field is entirely unused outside of this function, so it seems we
can just drop it entirely.
