udf: Prevent write-unsupported filesystem to be remounted read-write

There are certain filesystem features which we support for reading but
not for writing. We properly refuse to mount such filesystems read-write
however for some features (such as read-only partitions), we don't check
for these features when remounting the filesystem from read-only to
read-write. Thus such filesystems could be remounted read-write leading
to strange behavior (most likely crashes).

Fix the problem by marking in superblock whether the filesystem has some
features that are supported in read-only mode and check this flag during
remount.
