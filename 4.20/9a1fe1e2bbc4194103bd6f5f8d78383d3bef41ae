fm10k: add missing device IDs to the upstream driver

The device IDs for the Ethernet SDI Adapter devices were never added to
the upstream driver. The IDs are already in the pci.ids database, and
are supported by the out-of-tree driver.

Add the device IDs now, so that the upstream driver can recognize and
load these devices.
