btrfs: relocation: Add basic extent backref related comments for build_backref_tree

fs/btrfs/relocation.c:build_backref_tree() is some code from 2009 era,
although it works pretty fine, it's not that easy to understand.
Especially combined with the complex btrfs backref format.

This patch adds some basic comment for the backref build part of the
code, making it less hard to read, at least for backref searching part.
