bpf: devmap: fix wrong interface selection in notifier_call

The dev_map_notification() removes interface in devmap if
unregistering interface's ifindex is same.
But only checking ifindex is not enough because other netns can have
same ifindex. so that wrong interface selection could occurred.
Hence netdev pointer comparison code is added.

v2: compare netdev pointer instead of using net_eq() (Daniel Borkmann)
v1: Initial patch
