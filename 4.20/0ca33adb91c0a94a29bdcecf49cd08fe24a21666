drm/vkms: Fix race condition around accessing frame number

crtc_state is accessed by both vblank_handle() and the ordered
work_struct handle vkms_crc_work_handle() to retrieve and or update
the frame number for computed CRC.

Since work_struct can fail, add frame_end to account for missing frame
numbers.

Use (frame_[start/end]) for synchronization between hrtimer callback
and ordered work_struct handle.

This patch passes the following subtests from igt kms_pipe_crc_basic test:
bad-source, read-crc-pipe-A, read-crc-pipe-A-frame-sequence,
nonblocking-crc-pipe-A, nonblocking-crc-pipe-A-frame-sequence
