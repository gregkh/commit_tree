fuse: allocate page array more efficiently

When allocating page array for a request the array for the page pointers
and the array for page descriptors are allocated by two separate kmalloc()
calls.  Merge these into one allocation.

Also instead of initializing the request and the page arrays with memset(),
use the zeroing allocation variants.

Reserved requests never carry pages (page array size is zero). Make that
explicit by initializing the page array pointers to NULL and make sure the
assumption remains true by adding a WARN_ON().
