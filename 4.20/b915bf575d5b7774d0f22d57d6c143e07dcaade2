media: cec: make cec_get_edid_spa_location() an inline function

This function is needed by both V4L2 and CEC, so move this to
cec.h as a static inline since there are no obvious shared
modules between the two subsystems.

This patch, together with the following ones, fixes a
dependency bug: if CEC_CORE is disabled, then building adv7604
(and other HDMI receivers) will fail because an essential
function is now stubbed out.
