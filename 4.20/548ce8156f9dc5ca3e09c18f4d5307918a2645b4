dt-bindings/interrupt-controller: Update Marvell ICU bindings

Change the documentation to reflect the new bindings used for Marvell
ICU. This involves describing each interrupt group as a subnode of the
ICU node. Each of them having their own compatible.

The DT binding documentation still documents the legacy binding, where
there was a single node with no subnode.
