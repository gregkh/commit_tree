team: no need to do team_notify_peers or team_mcast_rejoin when disabling port

team_notify_peers() will send ARP and NA to notify peers. team_mcast_rejoin()
will send multicast join group message to notify peers. We should do this when
enabling/changed to a new port. But it doesn't make sense to do it when a port
is disabled.

On the other hand, when we set mcast_rejoin_count to 2, and do a failover,
team_port_disable() will increase mcast_rejoin.count_pending to 2 and then
team_port_enable() will increase mcast_rejoin.count_pending to 4. We will send
4 mcast rejoin messages at latest, which will make user confused. The same
with notify_peers.count.

Fix it by deleting team_notify_peers() and team_mcast_rejoin() in
team_port_disable().
