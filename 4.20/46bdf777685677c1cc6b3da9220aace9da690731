RDMA: Fix dependencies for rdma_user_mmap_io

The mlx4 driver produces a link error when it is configured
as built-in while CONFIG_INFINIBAND_USER_ACCESS is set to =m:

drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx4/main.o: In function `mlx4_ib_mmap':
main.c:(.text+0x1af4): undefined reference to `rdma_user_mmap_io'

The same function is called from mlx5, which already has a
dependency to ensure we can call it, and from hns, which
appears to suffer from the same problem.

This adds the same dependency that mlx5 uses to the other two.
