PCI: Fix incorrect value returned from pcie_get_speed_cap()

The macros PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_SLS_*GB are values, not bit masks.  We must mask
the register and compare it against them.

This fixes errors like this:

  amdgpu: [powerplay] failed to send message 261 ret is 0

when a PCIe-v3 card is plugged into a PCIe-v1 slot, because the slot is
being incorrectly reported as PCIe-v3 capable.

6cf57be0f78e, which appeared in v4.17, added pcie_get_speed_cap() with the
incorrect test of PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_SLS as a bitmask.  5d9a63304032, which
appeared in v4.19, changed amdgpu to use pcie_get_speed_cap(), so the
amdgpu bug reports below are regressions in v4.19.

Fixes: 6cf57be0f78e ("PCI: Add pcie_get_speed_cap() to find max supported link speed")
Fixes: 5d9a63304032 ("drm/amdgpu: use pcie functions for link width and speed")

[bhelgaas: update comment, remove use of PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_SLS_8_0GB and
PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_SLS_16_0GB since those should be covered by PCI_EXP_LNKCAP2,
remove test of PCI_EXP_LNKCAP for zero, since that register is required]
