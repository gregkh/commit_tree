net/mlx5: Add Fast teardown support

Today mlx5 devices support two teardown modes:
1- Regular teardown
2- Force teardown

This change introduces the enhanced version of the "Force teardown" that
allows SW to perform teardown in a faster way without the need to reclaim
all the pages.

Fast teardown provides the following advantages:
1- Fix a FW race condition that could cause command timeout
2- Avoid moving to polling mode
3- Close the vport to prevent PCI ACK to be sent without been scatter
to memory
