Auto-detect whether a FPU exists

We expect that a kernel with CONFIG_FPU=y can still support no-FPU
machines. To do so, the kernel should first examine the existence of a
FPU, then do nothing if a FPU does exist; otherwise, it should
disable/bypass all FPU-related functions.

In this patch, a new global variable, has_fpu, is created and determined
when parsing the hardware capability from device tree during booting.
This variable is used in those FPU-related functions.
