fuse: continue to send FUSE_RELEASEDIR when FUSE_OPEN returns ENOSYS

When FUSE_OPEN returns ENOSYS, the no_open bit is set on the connection.

Because the FUSE_RELEASE and FUSE_RELEASEDIR paths share code, this
incorrectly caused the FUSE_RELEASEDIR request to be dropped and never sent
to userspace.

Pass an isdir bool to distinguish between FUSE_RELEASE and FUSE_RELEASEDIR
inside of fuse_file_put.
