net/mlx5: E-Switch, Fix fdb cap bits swap

The cap bits locations for the fdb caps of multi path to table (used for
local mirroring) and multi encap (used for prio/chains) were wrongly used
in swapped locations. This went unnoted so far b/c we tested the offending
patch with CX5 FW that supports both of them. On different environments where
not both caps are supported, we will be messed up, fix that.
