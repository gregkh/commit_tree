MAINTAINERS: add entry for i2c-axxia driver

Create separate entry for i2c-axxia and set myself as maintainer.

Even though I don't work for Intel/LSI who is the manufacturer of this
IP, I do have access to some documentation and the actual hardware using
this driver and I'm familiar with the code.
