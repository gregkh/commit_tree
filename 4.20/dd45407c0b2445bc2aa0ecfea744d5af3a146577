x86/intel_rdt: Use perf infrastructure for measurements

The success of a cache pseudo-locked region is measured using
performance monitoring events that are programmed directly at the time
the user requests a measurement.

Modifying the performance event registers directly is not appropriate
since it circumvents the in-kernel perf infrastructure that exists to
manage these resources and provide resource arbitration to the
performance monitoring hardware.

The cache pseudo-locking measurements are modified to use the in-kernel
perf infrastructure. Performance events are created and validated with
the appropriate perf API. The performance counters are still read as
directly as possible to avoid the additional cache hits. This is
done safely by first ensuring with the perf API that the counters have
been programmed correctly and only accessing the counters in an
interrupt disabled section where they are not able to be moved.

As part of the transition to the in-kernel perf infrastructure the L2
and L3 measurements are split into two separate measurements that can
be triggered independently. This separation prevents additional cache
misses incurred during the extra testing code used to decide if a
L2 and/or L3 measurement should be made.
