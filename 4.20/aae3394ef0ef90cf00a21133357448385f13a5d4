fbdev: fix broken menu dependencies

The framebuffer options and devices menu is unintentionally split
or broken because some items in it do not depend on FB (including
several under omap and mmp).
Fix this by moving FB_CMDLINE, FB_NOTIFY, and FB_CLPS711X_OLD to
just before the FB Kconfig symbol definition and by moving the
omap, omap2, and mmp menus to last, following FB_SM712.

Also, the FB_VIA dependencies are duplicated by both being inside
an "if FB_VIA/endif" block and "depends on FB_VIA", so drop the
"depends on FB_VIA" lines since they are redundant.
