media: v4l: fwnode: Initialise the V4L2 fwnode endpoints to zero

Initialise the V4L2 fwnode endpoints to zero in all drivers using
v4l2_fwnode_endpoint_parse(). This prepares for setting default endpoint
flags as well as the bus type. Setting bus type to zero will continue to
guess the bus among the guessable set (parallel, Bt.656 and CSI-2 D-PHY).
