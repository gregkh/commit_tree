staging: rtl8723bs: Remove unnecessary parentheses and dead commented code

Clang warns when multiple pairs of parentheses are used for a single
conditional statement.

drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/hal/rtl8723b_hal_init.c:3351:20: warning:
equality comparison with extraneous parentheses [-Wparentheses-equality]

The commented code is pointless since _HW_STATE_AP_ is handled right
below this block.
