Input: reserve 2 events code because of HID

Prior to commit 190d7f02ce8e ("HID: input: do not increment usages when
a duplicate is found") from the v4.18 kernel, HID used to shift the
event codes if a duplicate usage was found. This ended up in a situation
where a device would export a ton of ABS_MISC+n event codes, or a ton
of REL_MISC+n event codes.

This is now fixed, however userspace needs to detect those situation.
Fortunately, ABS_MT_SLOT-1 (ABS_MISC+6) was never assigned a code, and
so libinput can detect fake multitouch devices from genuine ones by
checking if ABS_MT_SLOT-1 is set.

Now that we have REL_WHEEL_HI_RES, libinput won't be able to differentiate
true high res mice from some other device in a pre-v4.18 kernel.

Set in stone that the ABS_MISC+6 and REL_MISC+1 are reserved and should not
be used so userspace can properly work around those old kernels.
