packet: copy user buffers before orphan or clone

tpacket_snd sends packets with user pages linked into skb frags. It
notifies that pages can be reused when the skb is released by setting
skb->destructor to tpacket_destruct_skb.

This can cause data corruption if the skb is orphaned (e.g., on
transmit through veth) or cloned (e.g., on mirror to another psock).

Create a kernel-private copy of data in these cases, same as tun/tap
zerocopy transmission. Reuse that infrastructure: mark the skb as
SKBTX_ZEROCOPY_FRAG, which will trigger copy in skb_orphan_frags(_rx).

Unlike other zerocopy packets, do not set shinfo destructor_arg to
struct ubuf_info. tpacket_destruct_skb already uses that ptr to notify
when the original skb is released and a timestamp is recorded. Do not
change this timestamp behavior. The ubuf_info->callback is not needed
anyway, as no zerocopy notification is expected.

Mark destructor_arg as not-a-uarg by setting the lower bit to 1. The
resulting value is not a valid ubuf_info pointer, nor a valid
tpacket_snd frame address. Add skb_zcopy_.._nouarg helpers for this.

The fix relies on features introduced in commit 52267790ef52 ("sock:
add MSG_ZEROCOPY"), so can be backported as is only to 4.14.
