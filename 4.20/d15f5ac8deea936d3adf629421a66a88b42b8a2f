ipv6: frags: Fix bogus skb->sk in reassembled packets

It was reported that IPsec would crash when it encounters an IPv6
reassembled packet because skb->sk is non-zero and not a valid
pointer.

This is because skb->sk is now a union with ip_defrag_offset.

This patch fixes this by resetting skb->sk when exiting from
the reassembly code.
