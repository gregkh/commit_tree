dma-direct: do not include SME mask in the DMA supported check

The dma_direct_supported() function intends to check the DMA mask against
specific values. However, the phys_to_dma() function includes the SME
encryption mask, which defeats the intended purpose of the check. This
results in drivers that support less than 48-bit DMA (SME encryption mask
is bit 47) from being able to set the DMA mask successfully when SME is
active, which results in the driver failing to initialize.

Change the function used to check the mask from phys_to_dma() to
__phys_to_dma() so that the SME encryption mask is not part of the check.
