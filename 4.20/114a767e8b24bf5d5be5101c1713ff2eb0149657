octeontx2-af: Scan blocks for LFs provisioned to PF/VF

Scan all RVU blocks to find any 'LF to RVU PF/VF' mapping done by
low level firmware. If found any, mark them as used in respective
block's LF bitmap and also save mapped PF/VF's PF_FUNC info.

This is done to avoid reattaching a block LF to a different RVU PF/VF.
