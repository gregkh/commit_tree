btrfs: Enhance btrfs_trim_fs function to handle error better

Function btrfs_trim_fs() doesn't handle errors in a consistent way. If
error happens when trimming existing block groups, it will skip the
remaining blocks and continue to trim unallocated space for each device.

The return value will only reflect the final error from device trimming.

This patch will fix such behavior by:

1) Recording the last error from block group or device trimming
   The return value will also reflect the last error during trimming.
   Make developer more aware of the problem.

2) Continuing trimming if possible
   If we failed to trim one block group or device, we could still try
   the next block group or device.

3) Report number of failures during block group and device trimming
   It would be less noisy, but still gives user a brief summary of
   what's going wrong.

Such behavior can avoid confusion for cases like failure to trim the
first block group and then only unallocated space is trimmed.
