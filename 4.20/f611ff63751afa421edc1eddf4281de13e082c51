nilfs2: Convert to XArray

This is close to a 1:1 replacement of radix tree APIs with their XArray
equivalents.  It would be possible to optimise nilfs_copy_back_pages(),
but that doesn't seem to be in the performance path.  Also, I think
it has a pre-existing bug, and I've added a note to that effect in the
source code.
