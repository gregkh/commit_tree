tools include: Adopt linux/bits.h

So that we reduce the difference of tools/include/linux/bitops.h to the
original kernel file, include/linux/bitops.h, trying to remove the need
to define BITS_PER_LONG, to avoid clashes with asm/bitsperlong.h.

And the things removed from tools/include/linux/bitops.h are really in
linux/bits.h, so that we can have a copy and then
tools/perf/check_headers.sh will tell us when new stuff gets added to
linux/bits.h so that we can check if it is useful and if any adjustment
needs to be done to the tools/{include,arch}/ copies.
