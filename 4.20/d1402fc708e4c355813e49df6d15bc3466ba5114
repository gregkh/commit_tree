mm: introduce common STRUCT_PAGE_MAX_SHIFT define

This define is used by arm64 to calculate the size of the vmemmap
region.  It is defined as the log2 of the upper bound on the size of a
struct page.

We move it into mm_types.h so it can be defined properly instead of set
and checked with a build bug.  This also allows us to use the same
define for riscv.
