lightnvm: pblk: take write semaphore on metadata

pblk guarantees write ordering at a chunk level through a per open chunk
semaphore. At this point, since we only have an open I/O stream for both
user and GC data, the semaphore is per parallel unit.

For the metadata I/O that is synchronous, the semaphore is not needed as
ordering is guaranteed. However, if the metadata scheme changes or
multiple streams are open, this guarantee might not be preserved.

This patch makes sure that all writes go through the semaphore, even for
synchronous I/O. This is consistent with pblk's write I/O model. It also
simplifies maintenance since changes in the metadata scheme could cause
ordering issues.
