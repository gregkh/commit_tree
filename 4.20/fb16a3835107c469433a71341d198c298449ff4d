staging: bcm2835-audio: Use coherent device buffers

The memory access to the pages allocated with
SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_CONTINUOUS are basically non-coherent, and it becomes a
problem when a process accesses via mmap.

For the more consistent access, use the device coherent memory, just
by replacing the call pattern in the allocator helpers.

The only point we need to be careful for is the device object passed
there; since bcm2835-audio driver creates fake devices and each card
is created on top of that, we need to pass its parent device as the
real device object.
