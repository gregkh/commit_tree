ice: Prevent control queue operations during reset

Once reset is issued, the driver loses all control queue interfaces.
Exercising control queue operations during reset is incorrect and
may result in long timeouts.

This patch introduces a new field 'reset_ongoing' in the hw structure.
This is set to 1 by the core driver when it receives a reset interrupt.
ice_sq_send_cmd checks reset_ongoing before actually issuing the control
queue operation. If a reset is in progress, it returns a soft error code
(ICE_ERR_RESET_PENDING) to the caller. The caller may or may not have to
take any action based on this return. Once the driver knows that the
reset is done, it has to set reset_ongoing back to 0. This will allow
control queue operations to be posted to the hardware again.

This "bail out" logic was specifically added to ice_sq_send_cmd (which
is pretty low level function) so that we have one solution in one place
that applies to all types of control queues.
