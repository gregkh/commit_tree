net: hns3: remove unnecessary queue reset in the hns3_uninit_all_ring()

It is not necessary to reset the queue in the hns3_uninit_all_ring(),
since the queue is stopped in the down operation, and will be reset
in the up operation. And the judgment of the HCLGE_STATE_RST_HANDLING
flag in the hclge_reset_tqp() is not correct, because we need to reset
tqp during pf reset, otherwise it may cause queue not being reset to
working state problem.
