bpf: introduce per-cpu cgroup local storage

This commit introduced per-cpu cgroup local storage.

Per-cpu cgroup local storage is very similar to simple cgroup storage
(let's call it shared), except all the data is per-cpu.

The main goal of per-cpu variant is to implement super fast
counters (e.g. packet counters), which don't require neither
lookups, neither atomic operations.

>From userspace's point of view, accessing a per-cpu cgroup storage
is similar to other per-cpu map types (e.g. per-cpu hashmaps and
arrays).

Writing to a per-cpu cgroup storage is not atomic, but is performed
by copying longs, so some minimal atomicity is here, exactly
as with other per-cpu maps.
