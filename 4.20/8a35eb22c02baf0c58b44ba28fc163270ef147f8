signal/x86: In trace_mpx_bounds_register_exception add __user annotations

The value passed in to addr_referenced is of type void __user *, so update
the addr_referenced parameter in trace_mpx_bounds_register_exception to match.

Also update the addr_referenced paramater in TP_STRUCT__entry as it again
holdes the same value.

I don't know why this was missed earlier but sparse was complaining when
testing test branch so fix this now.
