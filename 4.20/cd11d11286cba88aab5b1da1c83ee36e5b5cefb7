net/af_iucv: locate IUCV header via skb_network_header()

This patch attempts to untangle the TX and RX code in qeth from
af_iucv's respective HiperTransport path:
On the TX side, pointing skb_network_header() at the IUCV header
means that qeth_l3_fill_af_iucv_hdr() no longer needs a magical offset
to access the header.
On the RX side, qeth pulls the (fake) L2 header off the skb like any
normal ethernet driver would. This makes working with the IUCV header
in af_iucv easier, since we no longer have to assume a fixed skb layout.

While at it, replace the open-coded length checks in af_iucv's RX path
with pskb_may_pull().
