pcmcia: remove KERN_INFO level from debug message

The KERN_INFO level is being appended to the "%s:" string in the DEBUGP
macro, so it isn't actually doing what was originally intended and instead
inserts it in the wrong place.  Remove it so it is at least we're using
the DEBUGP macro consistently throughout the driver and we're not going
to lose any functionality in message level with change anyhow.

Caught by smatch static analysis:

  drivers/char/pcmcia/cm4040_cs.c:509 cm4040_reader_release()
     warn: KERN_* level not at start of string
