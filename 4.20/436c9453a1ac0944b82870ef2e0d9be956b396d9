virtio-net: keep vnet header zeroed after processing XDP

We copy vnet header unconditionally in page_to_skb() this is wrong
since XDP may modify the packet data. So let's keep a zeroed vnet
header for not confusing the conversion between vnet header and skb
metadata.

In the future, we should able to detect whether or not the packet was
modified and keep using the vnet header when packet was not touched.
