tracing/kprobes: Check the probe on unloaded module correctly

Current kprobe event doesn't checks correctly whether the
given event is on unloaded module or not. It just checks
the event has ":" in the name.

That is not enough because if we define a probe on non-exist
symbol on loaded module, it allows to define that (with
warning message)

To ensure it correctly, this searches the module name on
loaded module list and only if there is not, it allows to
define it. (this event will be available when the target
module is loaded)
