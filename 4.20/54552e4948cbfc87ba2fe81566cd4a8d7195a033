mmc: sdhci: introduce adma_write_desc() hook to struct sdhci_ops

Add this hook so that it can be overridden with driver specific
implementations. We also let the original sdhci_adma_write_desc()
accept &desc so that the function can set its new value. Then export
the function so that it could be reused by driver's specific
implementations.
