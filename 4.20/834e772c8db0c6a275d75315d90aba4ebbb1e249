vhost/vsock: fix use-after-free in network stack callers

If the network stack calls .send_pkt()/.cancel_pkt() during .release(),
a struct vhost_vsock use-after-free is possible.  This occurs because
.release() does not wait for other CPUs to stop using struct
vhost_vsock.

Switch to an RCU-enabled hashtable (indexed by guest CID) so that
.release() can wait for other CPUs by calling synchronize_rcu().  This
also eliminates vhost_vsock_lock acquisition in the data path so it
could have a positive effect on performance.

This is CVE-2018-14625 "kernel: use-after-free Read in vhost_transport_send_pkt".
