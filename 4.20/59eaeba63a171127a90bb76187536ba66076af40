of: base: Change logic in of_alias_get_alias_list()

Check compatible string first before setting up bit in bitmap to also
cover cases that allocated bitfield is not big enough.
Show warning about it but let driver to continue to work with allocated
bitfield to keep at least some devices (included console which
is commonly close to serial0) to work.

Fixes: ae1cca3fa347 ("serial: uartps: Change uart ID port allocation")
