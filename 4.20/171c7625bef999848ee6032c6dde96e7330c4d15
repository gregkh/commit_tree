net/mlx5: Use flow counter IDs and not the wrapping cache object

Currently, when a flow rule is created using the FS core layer, the caller
has to pass the entire flow counter object and not just the counter HW
handle (ID). This requires both the FS core and the caller to have
knowledge about the inner implementation of the FS layer flow counters
cache and limits the possible users.

Move to use the counter ID across the place when dealing with flows.

Doing this decoupling, now can we privatize the inner implementation
of the flow counters.
