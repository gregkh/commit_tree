clk: rockchip: Fix static checker warning in rockchip_ddrclk_get_parent call

Fixes the signedness bug returning '(-22)' on the return type by removing the
sanity checker in rockchip_ddrclk_get_parent(). The function should return
and unsigned value only and it's safe to remove the sanity checker as the
core functions that call get_parent like clk_core_get_parent_by_index already
ensures the validity of the clk index returned (index >= core->num_parents).
