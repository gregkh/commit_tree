thunderbolt: Print connected devices

The previous patch made the driver less verbose meanining that all the
switch structures and ports are now logged as debug level. However, we
have been missing similar output that USB for intance prints when a new
USB device is connected and disconnected. This information is useful for
end users as well as developers because it immediately shows the actual
device that was connected.

This patch adds printing of the actual connected devices to the driver.
