netfilter: xt_quota: fix the behavior of xt_quota module

A major flaw of the current xt_quota module is that quota in a specific
rule gets reset every time there is a rule change in the same table. It
makes the xt_quota module not very useful in a table in which iptables
rules are changed at run time. This fix introduces a new counter that is
visible to userspace as the remaining quota of the current rule. When
userspace restores the rules in a table, it can restore the counter to
the remaining quota instead of resetting it to the full quota.
