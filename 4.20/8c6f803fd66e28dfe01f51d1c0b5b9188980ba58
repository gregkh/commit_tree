scsi: esp_scsi: Optimize PIO loops

Avoid function calls in the inner PIO loops. On a Centris 660av this
improves throughput for sequential read transfers by about 40% and
sequential write by about 10%.

Unfortunately it is not possible to have methods like .esp_write8 placed
inline so this is always going to be slow, even with LTO.
