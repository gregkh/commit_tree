mmc: sdhci: Add 32-bit block count support for v4 mode

Host Controller Version 4.10 re-defines SDMA System Address register
as 32-bit Block Count for v4 mode, and SDMA uses ADMA System
Address register (05Fh-058h) instead if v4 mode is enabled. Also
when using 32-bit block count, 16-bit block count register need
to be set to zero.

Since using 32-bit Block Count would cause problems for auto-cmd23,
it can be chosen via host->quirk2.
