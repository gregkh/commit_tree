drm/i915/ringbuffer: Delay after invalidating gen6+ xcs

During stress testing of full-ppgtt (on Baytrail at least), we found
that the invalidation around a context/mm switch was insufficient (writes
would go astray). Adding a second MI_FLUSH_DW barrier prevents this, but
it is unclear as to whether this is merely a delaying tactic or if it is
truly serialising with the TLB invalidation. Either way, it is
empirically required.

v2: Avoid the loop for readability;
