drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Add mystery delay to enable()

This patch adds a 70ms mystery delay to the bridge driver in enable.
By experimentation, it seems like it can go anywhere up until we
initiate semi-auto link training. If we don't have the delay, link
training fails.

I tried to root cause this as best I could, but neither the datasheet
for the panel nor the bridge mention a delay of this magnitude in their
timing requirements. So for now, add the mystery delay until someone
figures out a better fix.

Changes in v3:
- Added to the set
