compiler: remove __no_sanitize_address_or_inline again

The __no_sanitize_address_or_inline and __no_kasan_or_inline defines
are almost identical. The only difference is that __no_kasan_or_inline
does not have the 'notrace' attribute.

To be able to replace __no_sanitize_address_or_inline with the older
definition, add 'notrace' to __no_kasan_or_inline and change to two
users of __no_sanitize_address_or_inline in the s390 code.

The 'notrace' option is necessary for e.g. the __load_psw_mask function
in arch/s390/include/asm/processor.h. Without the option it is possible
to trace __load_psw_mask which leads to kernel stack overflow.
