btrfs: Make btrfs_find_device_by_path return struct btrfs_device

Currently this function returns an error code as well as uses one of
its arguments as a return value for struct btrfs_device. Change the
function so that it returns btrfs_device directly and use the usual
"encode error in pointer" mechanics if something goes wrong. No
functional changes.
