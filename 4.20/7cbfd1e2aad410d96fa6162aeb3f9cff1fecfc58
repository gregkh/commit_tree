Bluetooth: btrsi: fix bt tx timeout issue

observed sometimes data is coming with unaligned address from kernel
BT stack. If unaligned address is passed, some data in payload is
stripped when packet is loading to firmware and this results, BT
connection timeout is happening.

sh# hciconfig hci0 up
Can't init device hci0: hci0 command 0x0c03 tx timeout

Fixed this by moving the data to aligned address.
