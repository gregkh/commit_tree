ARM: dts: sun8i: h3: Split out non-SoC-specific parts of Bananapi M2 Plus

Three more variants of the Bananapi M2 Plus have been introduced. One
with the H5 instead of the H3, another with the H2+ instead, and the
last with the H3 but with WiFi and eMMC removed.

All these variants use the same board. This patch splits out the
non-SoC-specific parts of the device tree, so that they can be shared
among all the variants. The original Bananapi M2 Plus has been renamed
to Bananapi M2 Plus H3.
