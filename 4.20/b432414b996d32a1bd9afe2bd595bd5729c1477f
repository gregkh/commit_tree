pinctrl: ssbi-gpio: Fix pm8xxx_pin_config_get() to be compliant

If you look at "pinconf-groups" in debugfs for ssbi-gpio you'll notice
it looks like nonsense.

The problem is fairly well described in commit 1cf86bc21257 ("pinctrl:
qcom: spmi-gpio: Fix pmic_gpio_config_get() to be compliant") and
commit 05e0c828955c ("pinctrl: msm: Fix msm_config_group_get() to be
compliant"), but it was pointed out that ssbi-gpio has the same
problem.  Let's fix it there too.
