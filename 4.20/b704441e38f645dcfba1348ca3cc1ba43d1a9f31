mmc: sdhci: fix the timeout check window for clock and reset

We observed some premature timeouts on a virtualization platform, the log
is like this:

case 1:
[159525.255629] mmc1: Internal clock never stabilised.
[159525.255818] mmc1: sdhci: ============ SDHCI REGISTER DUMP ===========
[159525.256049] mmc1: sdhci: Sys addr:  0x00000000 | Version:  0x00001002
...
[159525.257205] mmc1: sdhci: Wake-up:   0x00000000 | Clock:    0x0000fa03
From the clock control register dump, we are pretty sure the clock was
stablized.

case 2:
[  914.550127] mmc1: Reset 0x2 never completed.
[  914.550321] mmc1: sdhci: ============ SDHCI REGISTER DUMP ===========
[  914.550608] mmc1: sdhci: Sys addr:  0x00000010 | Version:  0x00001002

After checking the sdhci code, we found the timeout check actually has a
little window that the CPU can be scheduled out and when it comes back,
the original time set or check is not valid.
