perf top: Allow disabling the overwrite mode

In ebebbf082357 ("perf top: Switch default mode to overwrite mode") we
forgot to leave a way to disable that new default, add a --overwrite
option that can be disabled using --no-overwrite, since the code already
in such a way that we can readily disable this mode.

This is useful when investigating bugs with this mode like the recent
report from David Miller where lots of unknown symbols appear due to
disabling the events while processing them which disables all record
types, not just PERF_RECORD_SAMPLE, which makes it impossible to resolve
maps when we lose PERF_RECORD_MMAP records.

This can be easily seen while building a kernel, when there are lots of
short lived processes.
