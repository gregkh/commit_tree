watchdog: lantiq: update register names to better match spec

Some of the names of the bits were confusing to me.
Now the bits share the same prefix as the register they are set on.

The LTQ_WDT_CR_PWL register (bits 26:25) is the pre warning limit and it
does not turn anything on. It has 4 possible divers 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 and
1/16, this drivers only uses 1/16.
The LTQ_WDT_CR_CLKDIV register bits(25:24) is only configuring a clock
divers and do not turn any thing on too, all possible values are valid
dividers.
Using the LTQ_WDT_SR prefix is also wrong these bits are used in the
LTQ_WDT_CR registers, SR is the status register which is read only.

This uses GENMASK where it is a mask and it uses shifts when a value is
written to some bits.
