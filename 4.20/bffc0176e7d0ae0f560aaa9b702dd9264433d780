powerpc/eeh: Cleanup EEH_POSTPONED_PROBE

Currently a flag, EEH_POSTPONED_PROBE, is used to prevent an incorrect
message "EEH: No capable adapters found" from being displayed during
the boot of powernv systems.

It is necessary because, on powernv, the call to eeh_probe_devices()
made from eeh_init() is too early and EEH can't yet be enabled. A
second call is made later from eeh_pnv_post_init(), which succeeds.

(On pseries, the first call succeeds because PCI devices are set up
early enough and no second call is made.)

This can be simplified by moving the early call to eeh_probe_devices()
from eeh_init() (where it's seen by both platforms) to
pSeries_final_fixup(), so that each platform only calls
eeh_probe_devices() once, at a point where it can succeed.
This is slightly later in the boot sequence, but but still early
enough and it is now in the same place in the sequence for both
platforms (the pcibios_fixup hook).

The display of the message can be cleaned up as well, by moving it
into eeh_probe_devices().
