irqchip/gic-v3-its: Use pre-programmed redistributor tables with kdump kernels

If using a kdump kernel, and that we cannot disable LPIs to install
our own tables, let's switch to using the already allocated tables.

This means that we'll change some of the initial kernel's memory,
but at least we'll be able to have LPIs in this secondary kernel.
