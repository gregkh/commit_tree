btrfs: tests: polish ifdefs around testing helper

Avoid the inline ifdefs and use two sections for self-tests enabled and
disabled.

Though there could be no ifdef and unconditional test_bit of
BTRFS_FS_STATE_DUMMY_FS_INFO, the static inline can help to optimize out
any code that would depend on conditions using btrfs_is_testing.

As this is only for the testing code, drop unlikely().
