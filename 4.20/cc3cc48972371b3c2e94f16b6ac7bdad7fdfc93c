crypto: arm64/aes-blk - ensure XTS mask is always loaded

Commit 2e5d2f33d1db ("crypto: arm64/aes-blk - improve XTS mask handling")
optimized away some reloads of the XTS mask vector, but failed to take
into account that calls into the XTS en/decrypt routines will take a
slightly different code path if a single block of input is split across
different buffers. So let's ensure that the first load occurs
unconditionally, and move the reload to the end so it doesn't occur
needlessly.
