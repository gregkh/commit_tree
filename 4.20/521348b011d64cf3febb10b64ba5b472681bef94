x86/intel_rdt: Introduce utility to obtain CDP peer

Introduce a utility that, when provided with a RDT resource and an
instance of this RDT resource (a RDT domain), would return pointers to
the RDT resource and RDT domain that share the same hardware. This is
specific to the CDP resources that share the same hardware.

For example, if a pointer to the RDT_RESOURCE_L2DATA resource (struct
rdt_resource) and a pointer to an instance of this resource (struct
rdt_domain) is provided, then it will return a pointer to the
RDT_RESOURCE_L2CODE resource as well as the specific instance that
shares the same hardware as the provided rdt_domain.

This utility is created in support of the "exclusive" resource group
mode where overlap of resource allocation between resource groups need
to be avoided. The overlap test need to consider not just the matching
resources, but also the resources that share the same hardware.

Temporarily mark it as unused in support of patch testing to avoid
compile warnings until it is used.
