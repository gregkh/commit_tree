media: mpeg2-ctrls.h: move MPEG2 state controls to non-public header

The MPEG2 state controls for the cedrus stateless MPEG2 driver are
not yet stable. Move them out of the public headers into media/mpeg2-ctrls.h.

Eventually, once this has stabilized, they will be moved back to the
public headers.

Unfortunately I had to cast the control type to a u32 in two switch
statements to prevent a compiler warning about a control type define
not being part of the enum.
