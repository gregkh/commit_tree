locking/spinlocks: Remove an instruction from spin and write locks

Both spin locks and write locks currently do:

 f0 0f b1 17             lock cmpxchg %edx,(%rdi)
 85 c0                   test   %eax,%eax
 75 05                   jne    [slowpath]

This 'test' insn is superfluous; the cmpxchg insn sets the Z flag
appropriately.  Peter pointed out that using atomic_try_cmpxchg_acquire()
will let the compiler know this is true.  Comparing before/after
disassemblies show the only effect is to remove this insn.

Take this opportunity to make the spin & write lock code resemble each
other more closely and have similar likely() hints.
