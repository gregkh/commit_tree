test_firmware: fix error return getting clobbered

In the case where eq->fw->size > PAGE_SIZE the error return rc
is being set to EINVAL however this is being overwritten to
rc = req->fw->size because the error exit path via label 'out' is
not being taken.  Fix this by adding the jump to the error exit
path 'out'.
