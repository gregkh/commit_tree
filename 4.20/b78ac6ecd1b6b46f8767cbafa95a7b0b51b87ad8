net: phy: mdio-bcm-unimac: Allow configuring MDIO clock divider

Allow the configuration of the MDIO clock divider when the Device Tree
contains 'clock-frequency' property (similar to I2C and SPI buses).
Because the hardware may have lost its state during suspend/resume,
re-apply the MDIO clock divider upon resumption.
