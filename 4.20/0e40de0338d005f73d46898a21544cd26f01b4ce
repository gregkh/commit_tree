dax: Fix huge page faults

Using xas_load() with a PMD-sized xa_state would work if either a
PMD-sized entry was present or a PTE sized entry was present in the
first 64 entries (of the 512 PTEs in a PMD on x86).  If there was no
PTE in the first 64 entries, grab_mapping_entry() would believe there
were no entries present, allocate a PMD-sized entry and overwrite the
PTE in the page cache.

Use xas_find_conflict() instead which turns out to simplify
both get_unlocked_entry() and grab_mapping_entry().  Also remove a
WARN_ON_ONCE from grab_mapping_entry() as it will have already triggered
in get_unlocked_entry().
