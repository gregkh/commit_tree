drm/i915: Eliminate use of PAGE_SIZE as a virtual alignment

Using PAGE_SIZE for virtual offset alignment is superfluous as it is
equal to the minimum gtt alignment and so equivalent to 0. It is also
the wrong value to use as we stopped using physical page constructs for
the virtual GTT, i.e. it would be preferrable to use I915_GTT_PAGE_SIZE
and in these cases merely imply I915_GTT_MIN_ALIGNMENT.
