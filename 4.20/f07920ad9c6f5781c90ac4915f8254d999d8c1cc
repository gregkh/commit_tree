net/smc: abort CLC connection in smc_release

In case of a non-blocking SMC socket, the initial CLC handshake is
performed over a blocking TCP connection in a worker. If the SMC socket
is released, smc_release has to wait for the blocking CLC socket
operations (e.g., kernel_connect) inside the worker.

This patch aborts a CLC connection when the respective non-blocking SMC
socket is released to avoid waiting on socket operations or timeouts.
