vhost: fix IOTLB locking

Commit 78139c94dc8c ("net: vhost: lock the vqs one by one") moved the vq
lock to improve scalability, but introduced a possible deadlock in
vhost-iotlb. vhost_iotlb_notify_vq() now takes vq->mutex while holding
the device's IOTLB spinlock. And on the vhost_iotlb_miss() path, the
spinlock is taken while holding vq->mutex.

Since calling vhost_poll_queue() doesn't require any lock, avoid the
deadlock by not taking vq->mutex.
