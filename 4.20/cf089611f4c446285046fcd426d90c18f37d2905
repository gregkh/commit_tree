proc/vmcore: Fix i386 build error of missing copy_oldmem_page_encrypted()

Lianbo reported a build error with a particular 32-bit config, see Link
below for details.

Provide a weak copy_oldmem_page_encrypted() function which architectures
can override, in the same manner other functionality in that file is
supplied.
