drm/amdgpu/gmc9: Adjust GART and AGP location with xgmi offset (v2)

On hives with xgmi enabled, the fb_location aperture is a size
which defines the total framebuffer size of all nodes in the
hive.  Each GPU in the hive has the same view via the fb_location
aperture.  GPU0 starts at offset (0 * segment size),
GPU1 starts at offset (1 * segment size), etc.

For access to local vram on each GPU, we need to take this offset into
account. This including on setting up GPUVM page table and GART table

v2: squash in "drm/amdgpu: Init correct fb region for none XGMI configuration"
