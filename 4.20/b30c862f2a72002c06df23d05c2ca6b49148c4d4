clk: renesas: r8a77990: Add missing I2C7 clock

When trying to use I2C7 on R-Car E3:

    renesas-cpg-mssr e6150000.clock-controller: Cannot get module clock 1003: -2
    i2c-rcar e6690000.i2c: failed to add to PM domain always-on: -2
    i2c-rcar: probe of e6690000.i2c failed with error -2

Unlike other R-Car Gen3 SoCs, R-Car E3 has more than 7 I2C bus
interfaces.  Add the forgotten module clock for the 8th instance to fix
this.
