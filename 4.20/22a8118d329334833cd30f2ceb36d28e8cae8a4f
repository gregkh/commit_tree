crypto: testmgr - fix sizeof() on COMP_BUF_SIZE

After allocation, output and decomp_output both point to memory chunks of
size COMP_BUF_SIZE. Then, only the first bytes are zeroed out using
sizeof(COMP_BUF_SIZE) as parameter to memset(), because
sizeof(COMP_BUF_SIZE) provides the size of the constant and not the size of
allocated memory.

Instead, the whole allocated memory is meant to be zeroed out. Use
COMP_BUF_SIZE as parameter to memset() directly in order to accomplish
this.
