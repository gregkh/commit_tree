video: fbdev: remove dead old CLPS711x LCD support driver

Since commit c86f51737f8d ("ARM: clps711x: Switch to MULTIPLATFORM")
ARCH_CLPS711X depends on ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM to be enabled so the old
CLPS711x LCD support driver (enabled by the FB_CLPS711X_OLD config
option) can't be selected any longer. Remove all FB_CLPS711XX_OLD
code as it has been dead for over 2 years now. Please note that the
new CLPS711x LCD support driver (enabled by the FB_CLPS711X config
option) is still available in the kernel tree.
