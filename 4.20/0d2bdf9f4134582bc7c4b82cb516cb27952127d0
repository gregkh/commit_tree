nvme-fc: rework the request initialization code

Instead of setting and then clearing the first_sgl pointer for AEN requests,
leave that pointer zero. This patch does not change how requests are
initialized but avoids that Coverity reports the following complaint for
nvme_fc_init_aen_ops():

CID 1418400 (#1 of 1): Out-of-bounds access (OVERRUN)
4. overrun-buffer-val: Overrunning buffer pointed to by aen_op of 312 bytes by passing it to a function which accesses it at byte offset 312.
