powerpc/time: Use clockevents_register_device(), fixing an issue with large decrementer

We currently cap the decrementer clockevent at 4 seconds, even on systems
with large decrementer support. Fix this by converting the code to use
clockevents_register_device() which calculates the upper bound based on
the max_delta passed in.
