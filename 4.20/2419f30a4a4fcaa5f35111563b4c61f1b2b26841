USB: xhci: fix 'broken_suspend' placement in struct xchi_hcd

As commented in the struct's definition there shouldn't be anything
underneath its 'priv[0]' member as it would break some macros.

The patch converts the broken_suspend into a bit-field and relocates it
next to to the rest of bit-fields.
