pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a77990: Add R8A774C0 PFC support

Renesas RZ/G2E (a.k.a. r8a774c0) is pin compatible with R-Car
E3 (a.k.a. r8a77990), however it doesn't have several automotive
specific peripherals. Add a r8a77990 specific pin groups/functions
along with common pin groups/functions for supporting both r8a77990
and r8a774c0 SoCs.
