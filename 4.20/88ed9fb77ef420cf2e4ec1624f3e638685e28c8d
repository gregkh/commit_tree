drm/amd/display: fix memory leak in resource pools

[why]
ddc engines were recently changed to be independently tracked
from pipe count.  the change was reflected in resource constructor
but not in destructor.  this manifests as a memory leak when
pipe harvesting is enabled, since not all constructed ddc engines
are freed

[how]
make destructor symmetric with constructor for all dcX_resource
