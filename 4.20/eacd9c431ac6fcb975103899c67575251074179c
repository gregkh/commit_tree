arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: Orange Pi Win: Adjust CSI power rails

The Orange Pi Win board uses the AXP's ALDO1 power rail to drive the
VCC-CSI line, which, according to the schematic, needs to be set to 2.8V.

Also the ELDO3 power rail is connected to the CSI, with somewhat unclear
voltage requirements. Add this regulator and allow the voltage to be set
between 1.5V and 1.8V, which are the voltages mentioned in the
schematic.
