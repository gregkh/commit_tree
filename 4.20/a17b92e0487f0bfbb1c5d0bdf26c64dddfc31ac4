s390/zcrypt: provide apfs failure code on type 86 error reply

The apfs field (AP final status) is set on transport
protocol failures (reply code 0x90) for type 86 replies.
For CCA cprbs this value is copied into the xcrb status
field which gives userspace a hint for the failure reason.
However, for EP11 cprbs there is no such status field
in the xcrb struct. So now regardless of the request
type, if a reply type 86 with transport protocol failure
is seen, the apfs value is printed as part of the debug
message. So the user has a chance to see the apfs value
without using a special build kernel.
