netfilter: xt_cgroup: shrink size of v2 path

cgroup v2 path field is PATH_MAX which is too large, this is placing too
much pressure on memory allocation for people with many rules doing
cgroup v1 classid matching, side effects of this are bug reports like:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200639

This patch registers a new revision that shrinks the cgroup path to 512
bytes, which is the same approach we follow in similar extensions that
have a path field.
