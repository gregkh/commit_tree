PM / devfreq: Fix devfreq_add_device() when drivers are built as modules.

When the devfreq driver and the governor driver are built as modules,
the call to devfreq_add_device() or governor_store() fails because the
governor driver is not loaded at the time the devfreq driver loads. The
devfreq driver has a build dependency on the governor but also should
have a runtime dependency. We need to make sure that the governor driver
is loaded before the devfreq driver.

This patch fixes this bug by adding a try_then_request_governor()
function. First tries to find the governor, and then, if it is not found,
it requests the module and tries again.

Fixes: 1b5c1be2c88e (PM / devfreq: map devfreq drivers to governor using name)
