staging: vc04_services: Remove unused macros

This patch removes the macros and structs associated with the
"vchi_msg_queuev_ex" function, which was previously removed in 49bec49.
Also fixes the checkpatch.pl errors:

ERROR: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses
ERROR: space required after that ','
