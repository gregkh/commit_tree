ASoC: AMD: Fix simultaneous playback and capture on different channel

If capture and playback are started on different channel (I2S/BT)
there is a possibilty that channel information passed from machine driver
is overwritten before the configuration is done in dma driver.
Example:
113.597588: cz_max_startup: ---playback sets BT channel
113.597694: cz_dmic1_startup: ---capture sets I2S channel
113.597979: acp_dma_hw_params: ---configures capture for I2S channel
113.598114: acp_dma_hw_params: ---configures playback for I2S channel

This is fixed by having 2 separate instance for playback and capture.
