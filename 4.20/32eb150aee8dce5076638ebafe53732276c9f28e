KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Handle hypervisor instruction faults better

Currently the code for handling hypervisor instruction page faults
passes 0 for the flags indicating the type of fault, which is OK in
the usual case that the page is not mapped in the partition-scoped
page tables.  However, there are other causes for hypervisor
instruction page faults, such as not being to update a reference
(R) or change (C) bit.  The cause is indicated in bits in HSRR1,
including a bit which indicates that the fault is due to not being
able to write to a page (for example to update an R or C bit).
Not handling these other kinds of faults correctly can lead to a
loop of continual faults without forward progress in the guest.

In order to handle these faults better, this patch constructs a
"DSISR-like" value from the bits which DSISR and SRR1 (for a HISI)
have in common, and passes it to kvmppc_book3s_hv_page_fault() so
that it knows what caused the fault.
