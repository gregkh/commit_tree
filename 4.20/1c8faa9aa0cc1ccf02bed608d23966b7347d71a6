drm/amd/display: Enable DFS bypass support in DC config

[Why]

We explicitly disable DFS bypass support when creating DC. Support
for this feature should now be in place so it can be left implicitly
enabled.

[How]

Remove the line that disables DFS bypass support.

Note: This option was actually reset to false anyway for most of
the hardware I've tested on making this particular line misleading
in the first place. This patch also fixes this issue.
