scsi: ufs: Schedule clk gating work on correct queue

With commit 10e5e37581fc ("scsi: ufs: Add clock ungating to a separate
workqueue"), clock gating work was moved to a separate work queue with
WQ_MEM_RECLAIM set, since clock gating could occur from a memory reclaim
context. Unfortunately, clk_gating.gate_work was left queued via
schedule_delayed_work, which is a system workqueue that does not have
WQ_MEM_RECLAIM set.  Because ufshcd_ungate_work attempts to cancel
gate_work, the following warning appears:

The simple solution is to put the gate_work on the same WQ_MEM_RECLAIM
work queue as the ungate_work.
