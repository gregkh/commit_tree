ARM: add PROC_VTABLE and PROC_TABLE macros

Allow the way we access members of the processor vtable to be changed
at compile time.  We will need to move to per-CPU vtables to fix the
Spectre variant 2 issues on big.Little systems.

However, we have a couple of calls that do not need the vtable
treatment, and indeed cause a kernel warning due to the (later) use
of smp_processor_id(), so also introduce the PROC_TABLE macro for
these which always use CPU 0's function pointers.
