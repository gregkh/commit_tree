IB/{hfi1, qib, rdmavt}: Move copy SGE logic into rdmavt

This patch moves hfi1_copy_sge() into rdmavt for sharing with qib.
This patch also moves all the wss_*() functions into rdmavt as
several wss_*() functions are called from hfi1_copy_sge()

When SGE copy mode is adaptive, cacheless copy may be done in some cases
for performance reasons. In those cases, X86 cacheless copy function
is called since the drivers that use rdmavt and may set SGE copy mode
to adaptive are X86 only. For this reason, this patch adds
"depends on X86_64" to rdmavt/Kconfig.
