selftests/powerpc: Fix compilation issue due to asm label

We are using 'dscr_insn' as a label in inline asm to identify if a
SIGILL was generated by the mtspr instruction at that point. However,
with inline assembly, the compiler is still free to duplicate the asm
statement for optimization purposes, which results in the label being
defined twice with the error:
	/tmp/ccerQCql.s:874: Error: symbol `dscr_insn' is already defined

With different compiler versions, we may also see:
	/tmp/ccJzLDlN.o:(.toc+0x0): undefined reference to `dscr_insn'

Remove the use of the label in the inline assembly. Instead, just look
for the offending instruction in the signal handler.
