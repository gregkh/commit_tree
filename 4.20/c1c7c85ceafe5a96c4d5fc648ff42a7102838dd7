signal/powerpc: Call force_sig_fault from _exception

The callers of _exception don't need the pkey exception logic because
they are not processing a pkey exception.  So just call exception_common
directly and then call force_sig_fault to generate the appropriate siginfo
and deliver the appropriate signal.
