rxrpc: Use IPv4 addresses throught the IPv6

AF_RXRPC opens an IPv6 socket through which to send and receive network
packets, both IPv6 and IPv4.  It currently turns AF_INET addresses into
AF_INET-as-AF_INET6 addresses based on an assumption that this was
necessary; on further inspection of the code, however, it turns out that
the IPv6 code just farms packets aimed at AF_INET addresses out to the IPv4
code.

Fix AF_RXRPC to use AF_INET addresses directly when given them.
