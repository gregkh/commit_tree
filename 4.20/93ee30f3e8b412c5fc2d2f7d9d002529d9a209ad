xsk: i40e: get rid of useless struct xdp_umem_props

This commit gets rid of the structure xdp_umem_props. It was there to
be able to break a dependency at one point, but this is no longer
needed. The values in the struct are instead stored directly in the
xdp_umem structure. This simplifies the xsk code as well as af_xdp
zero-copy drivers and as a bonus gets rid of one internal header file.

The i40e driver is also adapted to the new interface in this commit.
