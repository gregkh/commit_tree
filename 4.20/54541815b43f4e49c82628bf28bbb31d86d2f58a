mmc: renesas_sdhi_internal_dmac: set scatter/gather max segment size

Fix warning when running with CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG_SG=y by allocating a
device_dma_parameters structure and filling in the max segment size. The
size used is the result of a discussion with Renesas hardware engineers
and unfortunately not found in the datasheet.
