mmc: sdhci-omap: Fix DCRC error handling during tuning

Commit 7d33c3581536 ("mmc: sdhci-omap: Workaround for Errata i802")
disabled DCRC interrupts during tuning. This write to the interrupt
enable register gets overwritten in sdhci_prepare_data() and the
interrupt is not in fact disabled. Fix this by disabling the interrupt
in the host->ier variable.
