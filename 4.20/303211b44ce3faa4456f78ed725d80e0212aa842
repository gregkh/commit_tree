net/mlx5e: Always initialize update stats delayed work

mlx5e_detach_netdev cancels update_stats work which was not initialized
in ipoib netdevice profile, as a result, the following assert occurs:

ODEBUG: assert_init not available (active state 0) object type:
timer_list hint:(null)

This change moves the update stats work to be initialized for all
mlx5e netdevices.
