net: hns3: Fix for vf vlan delete failed problem

There are only 128 entries in vf vlan table, if user has added
more than 128 vlan, fw will ignore it and disable the vf vlan
table. So when user deletes the vlan entry that has not been
set to vf vlan table, fw will return not found result and driver
treat that as error, which will cause vlan delete failed problem.

This patch fixes it by returning ok when fw returns not found
result.
