signal: Use SEND_SIG_PRIV not SEND_SIG_FORCED with SIGKILL and SIGSTOP

Now that siginfo is never allocated for SIGKILL and SIGSTOP there is
no difference between SEND_SIG_PRIV and SEND_SIG_FORCED for SIGKILL
and SIGSTOP.  This makes SEND_SIG_FORCED unnecessary and redundant in
the presence of SIGKILL and SIGSTOP.  Therefore change users of
SEND_SIG_FORCED that are sending SIGKILL or SIGSTOP to use
SEND_SIG_PRIV instead.

This removes the last users of SEND_SIG_FORCED.
