KVM: PPC: Use ccr field in pt_regs struct embedded in vcpu struct

When the 'regs' field was added to struct kvm_vcpu_arch, the code
was changed to use several of the fields inside regs (e.g., gpr, lr,
etc.) but not the ccr field, because the ccr field in struct pt_regs
is 64 bits on 64-bit platforms, but the cr field in kvm_vcpu_arch is
only 32 bits.  This changes the code to use the regs.ccr field
instead of cr, and changes the assembly code on 64-bit platforms to
use 64-bit loads and stores instead of 32-bit ones.
