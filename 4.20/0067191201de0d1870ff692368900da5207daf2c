afs: Commit the status on a new file/dir/symlink

Call the function to commit the status on a new file, dir or symlink so
that the access rights for the caller's key are cached for that object.

Without this, the next access to the file will cause a FetchStatus
operation to be emitted to retrieve the access rights.
