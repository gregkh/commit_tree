sctp: clear the transport of some out_chunk_list chunks in sctp_assoc_rm_peer

If a transport is removed by asconf but there still are some chunks with
this transport queuing on out_chunk_list, later an use-after-free issue
will be caused when accessing this transport from these chunks in
sctp_outq_flush().

This is an old bug, we fix it by clearing the transport of these chunks
in out_chunk_list when removing a transport in sctp_assoc_rm_peer().
