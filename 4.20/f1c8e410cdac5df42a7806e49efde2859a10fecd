cpuidle: menu: Avoid computations when result will be discarded

If the minimum interval taken into account in the average computation
loop in get_typical_interval() is less than the expected idle
duration determined so far, the resultant average cannot be greater
than that value as well and the entire return result of the function
is going to be discarded anyway going forward.

In that case, it is a waste of time to carry out the remaining
computations in get_typical_interval(), so avoid that by returning
early if the minimum interval is not below the expected idle duration.

No intentional changes of behavior.
