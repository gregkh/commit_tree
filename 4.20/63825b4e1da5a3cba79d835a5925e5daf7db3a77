fuse: do not take fc->lock in fuse_request_send_background()

Currently, we take fc->lock there only to check for fc->connected.
But this flag is changed only on connection abort, which is very
rare operation.

So allow checking fc->connected under just fc->bg_lock and use this lock
(as well as fc->lock) when resetting fc->connected.
