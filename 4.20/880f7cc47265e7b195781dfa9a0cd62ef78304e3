arm64: cpu_errata: Remove ARM64_MISMATCHED_CACHE_LINE_SIZE

There's no need to treat mismatched cache-line sizes reported by CTR_EL0
differently to any other mismatched fields that we treat as "STRICT" in
the cpufeature code. In both cases we need to trap and emulate EL0
accesses to the register, so drop ARM64_MISMATCHED_CACHE_LINE_SIZE and
rely on ARM64_MISMATCHED_CACHE_TYPE instead.
