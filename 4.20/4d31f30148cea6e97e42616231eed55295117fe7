bpf: don't set id on after map lookup with ptr_to_map_val return

In the verifier there is no such semantics where registers with
PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE type have an id assigned to them. This is only
used in PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE_OR_NULL and later on nullified once the
test against NULL has been pattern matched and type transformed
into PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE.
