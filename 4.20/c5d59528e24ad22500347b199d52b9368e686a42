media: pci: cx23885: handle adding to list failure

altera_hw_filt_init() which calls append_internal() assumes
that the node was successfully linked in while in fact it can
silently fail. So the call-site needs to set return to -ENOMEM
on append_internal() returning NULL and exit through the err path.
