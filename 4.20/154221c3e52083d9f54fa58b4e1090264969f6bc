kmemleak: add module param to print warnings to dmesg

Currently, kmemleak only prints the number of suspected leaks to dmesg but
requires the user to read a debugfs file to get the actual stack traces of
the objects' allocation points.  Add a module option to print the full
object information to dmesg too.  It can be enabled with
kmemleak.verbose=1 on the kernel command line, or "echo 1 >
/sys/module/kmemleak/parameters/verbose":

This allows easier integration of kmemleak into test systems: We have
automated test infrastructure to test our Linux systems.  With this
option, running our tests with kmemleak is as simple as enabling kmemleak
and passing this command line option; the test infrastructure knows how to
save kernel logs, which will now include kmemleak reports.  Without this
option, the test infrastructure needs to be specifically taught to read
out the kmemleak debugfs file.  Removing this need for special handling
makes kmemleak more similar to other kernel debug options (slab debugging,
debug objects, etc).
