selftests: mlxsw: qos_mc_aware: Tweak for min shaper

Since the minimum shaper is now being enabled for MC TCs, it's
unreasonable to expect no UC traffic loss. Minimal min shaper value is
200Mbps, which is 20% of the 1Gbps that this test configures on egress.
To cover for glitches, tolerate up to 25% UC degradation under MC
overload.
