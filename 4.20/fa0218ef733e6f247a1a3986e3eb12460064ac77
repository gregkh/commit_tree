misc: kgdbts: Fix restrict error

kgdbts current fails when compiled with restrict:

drivers/misc/kgdbts.c: In function ‘configure_kgdbts’:
drivers/misc/kgdbts.c:1070:2: error: ‘strcpy’ source argument is the same as destination [-Werror=restrict]
  strcpy(config, opt);
  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the error says, config is being used in both the source and destination.
Refactor the code to avoid the extra copy and put the parsing closer to
the actual location.
