arm64: cpu: Move errata and feature enable callbacks closer to callers

The cpu errata and feature enable callbacks are only called via their
respective arm64_cpu_capabilities structure and therefore shouldn't
exist in the global namespace.

Move the PAN, RAS and cache maintenance emulation enable callbacks into
the same files as their corresponding arm64_cpu_capabilities structures,
making them static in the process.
