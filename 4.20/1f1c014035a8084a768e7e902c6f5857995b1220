arm64: compat: Add condition code checks and IT advance

Here's a /really nice/ part of the architecture: a CP15 access is
allowed to trap even if it fails its condition check, and SW must
handle it. This includes decoding the IT state if this happens in
am IT block. As a consequence, SW must also deal with advancing
the IT state machine.
