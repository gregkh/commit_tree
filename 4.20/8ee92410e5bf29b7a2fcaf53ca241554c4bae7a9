media: vb2: check for sane values from queue_setup

Warn and return error from the reqbufs ioctl when driver sets 0 number
of planes or 0 as plane sizes, as these values don't make any sense.
Checking this here stops obviously wrong values from propagating
further and causing various problems that are hard to trace back to
either of these values being 0.
