rcu: Eliminate rcu_state structure's ->call field

The rcu_state structure's ->call field references the corresponding RCU
flavor's call_rcu() function.  However, now that there is only ever one
rcu_state structure in a given build of the Linux kernel, and that flavor
uses plain old call_rcu(), there is not a lot of point in continuing to
have the ->call field.  This commit therefore removes it.
