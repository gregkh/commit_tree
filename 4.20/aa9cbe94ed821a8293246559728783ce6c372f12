arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: Olinuxino: enable USB

The Olinuxino has two USB sockets:
USB0 is connected to a micro B socket. As it has the ID pin wired and
the VBUS line connected to the PMIC, we describe it as a proper OTG socket,
which switches between host and device automatically.
USB1 is connected to a normal USB A socket. PG9 enables the power line,
so add the required regulator as well.
