iio: adc: imx25-gcq: Fix leak of device_node in mx25_gcq_setup_cfgs()

Leaving for_each_child_of_node loop we should release child device node,
if it is not stored for future use.

Found by Linux Driver Verification project (linuxtesting.org).

JC: I'm not sending this as a quick fix as it's been wrong for years,
but good to pick up for stable after the merge window.
