arm64: KVM: Enable Common Not Private translations

We rely on cpufeature framework to detect and enable CNP so for KVM we
need to patch hyp to set CNP bit just before TTBR0_EL2 gets written.

For the guest we encode CNP bit while building vttbr, so we don't need
to bother with that in a world switch.
