arm64: dts: ti: k3-am65: Change #address-cells and #size-cells of interconnect to 2

AM65 has two PCIe controllers and each PCIe controller has '2' address
spaces one within the 4GB address space of the SoC and the other above
the 4GB address space of the SoC (cbass_main) in addition to the
register space. The size of the address space above the 4GB SoC address
space is 4GB. These address ranges will be used by CPU/DMA to access
the PCIe address space. In order to represent the address space above
the 4GB SoC address space and to represent the size of this address
space as 4GB, change address-cells and size-cells of interconnect to 2.

Since OSPI has similar need in MCU Domain Memory Map, change
address-cells and size-cells of cbass_mcu interconnect also to 2.
