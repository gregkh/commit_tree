smb3: allow more detailed protocol info on open files for debugging

In order to debug complex problems it is often helpful to
have detailed information on the client and server view
of the open file information.  Add the ability for root to
view the list of smb3 open files and dump the persistent
handle and other info so that it can be more easily
correlated with server logs.

Sample output from "cat /proc/fs/cifs/open_files"
