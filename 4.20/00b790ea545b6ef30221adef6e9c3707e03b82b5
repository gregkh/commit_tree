HID: i2c-hid: Add a small delay after sleep command for Raydium touchpanel

Raydium touchpanel (2386:4B33) sometimes does not work in desktop session
although it works in display manager.

During user logging, the display manager exits, close the HID device,
then the device gets runtime suspended and powered off. The desktop
session begins shortly after, opens the HID device, then the device gets
runtime resumed and powered on.

If the trasition from display manager to desktop sesesion is fast, the
touchpanel cannot switch from powered off to powered on in short
timeframe. So add a small delay to workaround the issue.
