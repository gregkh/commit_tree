arm64: dts: marvell: add CPU Idle power state support on Armada 7K/8K

This patch adds CPU deep Idle and Cluster deep Idle states BUT it defines
the idle state for each cpu (defined under cpu-idle-states parameter)
only for the quad version therefore it does NOT activate CPU Idle
capability for the other version.
