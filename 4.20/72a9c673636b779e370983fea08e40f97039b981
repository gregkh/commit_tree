x86/defconfig: Enable CONFIG_USB_XHCI_HCD=y

A spanking new machine I just got has all but one USB ports wired as 3.0.
Booting defconfig resulted in no keyboard or mouse, which was pretty
uncool.  Let's enable that -- USB3 is ubiquitous rather than an oddity.
As 'y' not 'm' -- recovering from initrd problems needs a keyboard.

Also add it to the 32-bit defconfig.
