scsi: lpfc: Correct invalid EQ doorbell write on if_type=6

During attachment, the driver writes the EQ doorbell to disable potential
interrupts from an EQ. The current EQ doorbell format used for clearing the
interrupt is incorrect and uses an if_type=2 format, making the operation act
on the wrong EQ.

Correct the code to use the proper if_type=6 EQ doorbell format.
