x86/ioremap: Add an ioremap_encrypted() helper

When SME is enabled, the memory is encrypted in the first kernel. In
this case, SME also needs to be enabled in the kdump kernel, and we have
to remap the old memory with the memory encryption mask.

The case of concern here is if SME is active in the first kernel,
and it is active too in the kdump kernel. There are four cases to be
considered:

a. dump vmcore
   It is encrypted in the first kernel, and needs be read out in the
   kdump kernel.

b. crash notes
   When dumping vmcore, the people usually need to read useful
   information from notes, and the notes is also encrypted.

c. iommu device table
   It's encrypted in the first kernel, kdump kernel needs to access its
   content to analyze and get information it needs.

d. mmio of AMD iommu
   not encrypted in both kernels

Add a new bool parameter @encrypted to __ioremap_caller(). If set,
memory will be remapped with the SME mask.

Add a new function ioremap_encrypted() to explicitly pass in a true
value for @encrypted. Use ioremap_encrypted() for the above a, b, c
cases.
