net: phy: Allow BCM54616S PHY to setup internal TX/RX clock delay

This patch allows users to enable/disable internal TX and/or RX clock
delay for BCM54616S PHYs so as to satisfy RGMII timing specifications.

On a particular platform, whether TX and/or RX clock delay is required
depends on how PHY connected to the MAC IP. This requirement can be
specified through "phy-mode" property in the platform device tree.

The patch is inspired by commit 733336262b28 ("net: phy: Allow BCM5481x
PHYs to setup internal TX/RX clock delay").
