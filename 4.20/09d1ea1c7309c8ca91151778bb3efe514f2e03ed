devres: provide devm_kstrdup_const()

Provide a resource managed version of kstrdup_const(). This variant
internally calls devm_kstrdup() on pointers that are outside of
.rodata section and returns the string as is otherwise.

Make devm_kfree() check if the passed pointer doesn't point to .rodata
and if so - don't actually destroy the resource.
