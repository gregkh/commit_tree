ice: Move common functions out of ice_main.c part 1/7

The functions that are used for PF VSI/netdev setup will also be used
for SR-IOV support. To allow reuse of these functions, move these
functions out of ice_main.c to ice_common.c/ice_lib.c

This move is done across multiple patches. Each patch moves a few
functions and may have minor adjustments. For example, a function that was
previously static in ice_main.c will be made non-static temporarily in
its new location to allow the driver to build cleanly. These adjustments
will be removed in subsequent patches where more code is moved out of
ice_main.c

In this particular patch, the following functions were moved out of
ice_main.c:
int ice_add_mac_to_list
ice_free_fltr_list
ice_stat_update40
ice_stat_update32
ice_update_eth_stats
ice_vsi_add_vlan
ice_vsi_kill_vlan
ice_vsi_manage_vlan_insertion
ice_vsi_manage_vlan_stripping
