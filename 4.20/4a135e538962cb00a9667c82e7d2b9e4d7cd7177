xfrm_user: fix freeing of xfrm states on acquire

Commit 565f0fa902b6 ("xfrm: use a dedicated slab cache for struct
xfrm_state") moved xfrm state objects to use their own slab cache.
However, it missed to adapt xfrm_user to use this new cache when
freeing xfrm states.

Fix this by introducing and make use of a new helper for freeing
xfrm_state objects.
