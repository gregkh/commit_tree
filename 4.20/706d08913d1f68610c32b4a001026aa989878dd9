qed: Align local and global PTT to propagate through the APIs.

    Align the use of local PTT to propagate through the qed_mcp* API's.
    Global ptt should not be used.

    Register access should be done through layers. Register address is
    mapped into a PTT, PF translation table. Several interface functions
    require a PTT to direct read/write into register. There is a pool of
    PTT maintained, and several PTT are used simultaneously to access
    device registers in different flows. Same PTT should not be used in
    flows that can run concurrently.
    To avoid running out of PTT resources, too many PTT should not be
    acquired without releasing them. Every PF has a global PTT, which is
    used throughout the life of PF, in most important flows for register
    access. Generic functions acquire the PTT locally and release after
    the use. This patch aligns the use of Global PTT and Local PTT
    accordingly.
