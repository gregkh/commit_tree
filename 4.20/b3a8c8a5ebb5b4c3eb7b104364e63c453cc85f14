crypto: rsa-pkcs1pad: Allow hash to be optional [ver #2]

The original pkcs1pad implementation allowed to pad/unpad raw RSA
output.  However, this has been taken out in commit:
commit c0d20d22e0ad ("crypto: rsa-pkcs1pad - Require hash to be present")

This patch restored this ability as it is needed by the asymmetric key
implementation.
