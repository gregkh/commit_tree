gpiolib: override irq_enable/disable

When using the gpiolib irqchip helpers install irq_enable/disable
hooks for the irqchip to ensure that gpiolib knows when the irq
is enabled or disabled, allowing drivers to disable the irq and then
use it as an output pin, and later switch the direction to input and
re-enable the irq.
