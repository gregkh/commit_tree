lightnvm: pblk: guarantee emeta on line close

If a line is recovered from open chunks, the memory structures for
emeta have not necessarily been properly set on line initialization.
When closing a line, make sure that emeta is consistent so that the line
can be recovered on the fast path on next reboot.

Also, remove a couple of empty lines at the end of the function.
