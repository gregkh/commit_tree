of: make default address and size cells sizes private

Only some old OpenFirmware implementations rely on default sizes. Any
FDT and modern implementation should have explicit properties. Make the
OF_ROOT_NODE_*_CELLS_DEFAULT defines private so we don't get any outside
users.

This also gets us one step closer to removing the asm/prom.h dependency on
Sparc.
