btrfs: remove unused pointer 'tree' in btrfs_submit_compressed_read

Pointer 'tree' is being assigned but is never used hence it is redundant
and can be removed. This is a leftover from cleanup patch
00032d38eaa89c76de7 ("btrfs: drop extent_io_ops::merge_bio_hook
callback").

Cleans up clang warning:

  warning: variable 'tree' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
