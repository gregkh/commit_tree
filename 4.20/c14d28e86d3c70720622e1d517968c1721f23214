clk: rockchip: improve rk3288 pll rates for better hdmi output

Add and correct PLL rates for better hdmi output.

This includes minimizing jitter on 213 MHz for better 71 MHz,
250.5 MHz for better 83.5 MHz, 428 MHz for better 25.175 Mhz,
low jitter 273 MHz for better 68.25 mhz, 356 MHz for better 118.68 Mhz
and 300MHz.

Increase the used Fvco for 308, 324 MHz, 292.5 MHz, 273.6 MHz,
238 MHz and 216 MHz.

And add some additional rates allowing to reach better hdmi-related
rates in general.

These match the rates used by ChromeOS, so have been quite widely tested.
