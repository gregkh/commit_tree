btrfs: fix insert_reserved error handling

We were not handling the reserved byte accounting properly for data
references.  Metadata was fine, if it errored out the error paths would
free the bytes_reserved count and pin the extent, but it even missed one
of the error cases.  So instead move this handling up into
run_one_delayed_ref so we are sure that both cases are properly cleaned
up in case of a transaction abort.
