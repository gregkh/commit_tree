staging: wilc1000: remove unused wid from cfg struct

Cleanup patch to remove the unused element stored in cfg struct.
Removed those wid from the cfg variables whose value is not
fetched(GET_CFG) from the code. In case the wid is only set to the
firmware then there is need to store them as part of cfg variables, so
removed the unused code.
