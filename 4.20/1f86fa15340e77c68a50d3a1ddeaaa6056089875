drm: Clarify DRM_MODE_REFLECT_X/Y documentation

DRM_MODE_REFLECT_X and DRM_MODE_REFLECT_Y meaning seems a bit unclear
to me, so try to clarify that with a bit of ascii graphics.

Changes since v1:
  - Move the ascii graphics in the kerneldoc where all plane
    properties are already documented and make sure it's properly
    rendered, suggestested by Daniel Vetter.
