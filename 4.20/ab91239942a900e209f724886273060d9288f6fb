powerpc/prom: Remove VLA in prom_check_platform_support()

In prom_check_platform_support() we retrieve and parse the
"ibm,arch-vec-5-platform-support" property of the chosen node.
Currently we use a variable length array however to avoid this use an
array of constant length 8.

This property is used to indicate the supported options of vector 5
bytes 23-26 of the ibm,architecture.vec node. Each of these options
is a pair of bytes, thus for 4 options we have a max length of 8 bytes.
