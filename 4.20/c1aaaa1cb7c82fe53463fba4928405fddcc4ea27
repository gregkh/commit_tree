mfd: max8997: Disable interrupt handling for suspend/resume cycle

Disable IRQs during suspend/resume cycle to ensure handling of wakeup
interrupts (i.e. RTC wake alarm) after max8997_resume(). This way it can
be properly handled when I2C bus is finally available. This pattern is
also used in other MAX PMIC MFD drivers.
