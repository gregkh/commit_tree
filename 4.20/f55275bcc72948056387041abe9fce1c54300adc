ARM: defconfig: Disable PREEMPT again on  multi_v7

I should have let this soak for a while in linux-next, since we have at
least one board that hit a regression from it. Revert from 4.20-rc, and
we'll queue it for next merge window once regression is fixed.

This reverts commit 513eb98595522bc0cb83831a9daee1d5738e66f1.
