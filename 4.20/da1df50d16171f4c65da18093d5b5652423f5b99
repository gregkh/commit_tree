rcu: Remove rcu_state structure's ->rda field

The rcu_state structure's ->rda field was used to find the per-CPU
rcu_data structures corresponding to that rcu_state structure.  But now
there is only one rcu_state structure (creatively named "rcu_state")
and one set of per-CPU rcu_data structures (creatively named "rcu_data").
Therefore, uses of the ->rda field can always be replaced by "rcu_data,
and this commit makes that change and removes the ->rda field.
