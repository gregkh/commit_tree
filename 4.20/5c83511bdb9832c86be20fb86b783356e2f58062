x86/paravirt: Use a single ops structure

Instead of using six globally visible paravirt ops structures combine
them in a single structure, keeping the original structures as
sub-structures.

This avoids the need to assemble struct paravirt_patch_template at
runtime on the stack each time apply_paravirt() is being called (i.e.
when loading a module).

[ tglx: Made the struct and the initializer tabular for readability sake ]
