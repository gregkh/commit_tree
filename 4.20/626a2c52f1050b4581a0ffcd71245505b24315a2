drm/mxsfb: Move axi clk enable/disable to crtc enable/disable

The main axi clk is disabled at the end of mxsfb_crtc_mode_set_nofb and
immediately reenabled in mxsfb_enable_controller.

Avoid this by moving the handling of axi clk one level up to
mxsfb_crtc_enable. Do the same for mxsfb_crtc_disable for symmetry.

This shouldn't have any functional effect.
