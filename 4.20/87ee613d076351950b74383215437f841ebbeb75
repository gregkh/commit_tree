KVM: x86: hyperv: keep track of mismatched VP indexes

In most common cases VP index of a vcpu matches its vcpu index. Userspace
is, however, free to set any mapping it wishes and we need to account for
that when we need to find a vCPU with a particular VP index. To keep search
algorithms optimal in both cases introduce 'num_mismatched_vp_indexes'
counter showing how many vCPUs with mismatching VP index we have. In case
the counter is zero we can assume vp_index == vcpu_idx.
