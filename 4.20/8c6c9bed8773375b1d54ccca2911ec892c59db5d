cifs: don't dereference smb_file_target before null check

There is a null check on dst_file->private data which suggests
it can be potentially null. However, before this check, pointer
smb_file_target is derived from dst_file->private and dereferenced
in the call to tlink_tcon, hence there is a potential null pointer
deference.

Fix this by assigning smb_file_target and target_tcon after the
null pointer sanity checks.
