netfilter: conntrack: deconstify packet callback skb pointer

Only two protocols need the ->error() function: icmp and icmpv6.
This is because icmp error mssages might be RELATED to an existing
connection (e.g. PMTUD, port unreachable and the like), and their
->error() handlers do this.

The error callback is already optional, so remove it for
udp and call them from ->packet() instead.

As the error() callback can call checksum functions that write to
skb->csum*, the const qualifier has to be removed as well.
