USB: OHCI: Remove USB bus reset delay from OHCI handover code

Paul pointed out that the 50-ms sleep during OHCI initialization takes
up a large fraction of a system's boot time.  Things get worse when
there are two OHCI controllers present, each requiring 50 ms.

However, there really is no need to send a 50-ms reset signal out all
the root-hub ports during initialization.  The ports themselves will
be disabled, and the only way to enable a port is to reset it.
Therefore all attached USB devices will receive a proper reset in any
case.  The controller reset does not need to be long enough to reset
those other devices, so the 50-ms delay isn't necessary.

Without the delay, there is no remaining incentive for skipping the
reset when the controller is already in the RESET state.  This patch
removes the test, issuing the command unconditionally, and removes the
following delay.
