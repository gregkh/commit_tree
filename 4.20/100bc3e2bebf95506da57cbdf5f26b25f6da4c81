tty: serial: 8250_mtk: always resume the device in probe.

serial8250_register_8250_port calls uart_config_port, which calls
config_port on the port before it tries to power on the port. So we need
the port to be on before calling serial8250_register_8250_port. Change
the code to always do a runtime resume in probe before registering port,
and always do a runtime suspend in remove.

This basically reverts the change in commit 68e5fc4a255a ("tty: serial:
8250_mtk: use pm_runtime callbacks for enabling"), but still use
pm_runtime callbacks.
