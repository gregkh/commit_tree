PCI/AER: Queue one GHES event, not several uninitialized ones

ecae65e133f2 ("PCI/AER: Use kfifo_in_spinlocked() to insert locked
elements") replaced kfifo_put() with kfifo_in_spinlocked(), but passed the
*size* of the queue entry, where kfifo_in_spinlocked() expects the *number*
of entries to be copied.

We want to insert only one element into kfifo, not "sizeof(entry) = 16".
Without this patch, we would get 15 uninitialized elements.
