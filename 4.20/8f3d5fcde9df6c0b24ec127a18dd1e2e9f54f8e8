slimbus: core: update device status in probe

device status update can be racy with probe in some cases, so make sure
it take lock during the probe. Also after probe the device is expected
to be ready for communications, so make sure that a logical address
can be assigned to it after probe. If it fails to do so then probe
defer such instances.
