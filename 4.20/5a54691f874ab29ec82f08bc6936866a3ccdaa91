scsi: hisi_sas: Feed back linkrate(max/min) when re-attached

At directly attached situation, if the user modifies the sysfs interface
of maximum_linkrate and minimum_linkrate to renegotiate the linkrate
between SAS controller and target, the value of both files mentioned
above should have change to user setting after renegotiate is over, but
it remains unchanged.

To fix this bug, maximum_linkrate and minimum_linkrate will be directly
fed back to relevant sas_phy structure.
