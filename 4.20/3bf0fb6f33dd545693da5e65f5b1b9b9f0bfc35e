afs: Probe multiple fileservers simultaneously

Send probes to all the unprobed fileservers in a fileserver list on all
addresses simultaneously in an attempt to find out the fastest route whilst
not getting stuck for 20s on any server or address that we don't get a
reply from.

This alleviates the problem whereby attempting to access a new server can
take a long time because the rotation algorithm ends up rotating through
all servers and addresses until it finds one that responds.
