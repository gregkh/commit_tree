liquidio: fix race condition in instruction completion processing

In lio_enable_irq, the pkt_in_done count register was being cleared to
zero.  However, there could be some completed instructions which were not
yet processed due to budget and limit constraints.
So, only write this register with the number of actual completions
that were processed.
