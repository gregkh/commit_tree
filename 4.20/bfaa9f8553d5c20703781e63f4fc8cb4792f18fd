net: aquantia: fixed enable unicast on 32 macvlan

Fixed a condition mistake due to which macvlans unicast
item number 32 was not added in the unicast filter.

The consequence is that when exactly 32 macvlans are created
on NIC, the last created macvlan receives no traffic because
its MAC was not registered in HW.
