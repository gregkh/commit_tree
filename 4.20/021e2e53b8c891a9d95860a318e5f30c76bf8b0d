octeontx2-af: Add mailbox support infra

This patch adds mailbox support infrastructure APIs.
Each RVU device has a dedicated 64KB mailbox region
shared with it's peer for communication. RVU AF has
a separate mailbox region shared with each of RVU PFs
and a RVU PF has a separate region shared with each of
it's VF.

These set of APIs are used by this driver (RVU AF) and
other RVU PF/VF drivers eg netdev, crypto e.t.c.
