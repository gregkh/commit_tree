tools: bpftool: prevent infinite loop in get_fdinfo()

Function getline() returns -1 on failure to read a line, thus creating
an infinite loop in get_fdinfo() if the key is not found. Fix it by
calling the function only as long as we get a strictly positive return
value.

Found by copying the code for a key which is not always present...
