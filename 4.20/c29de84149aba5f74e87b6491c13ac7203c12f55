PCI: portdrv: Initialize service drivers directly

The PCI port driver saves the PCI state after initializing the device with
the applicable service devices.  This was, however, before the service
drivers were even registered because PCI probe happens before the
device_initcall initialized those service drivers.  The config space state
that the services set up were not being saved.  The end result would cause
PCI devices to not react to events that the drivers think they did if the
PCI state ever needed to be restored.

Fix this by changing the service drivers from using the init calls to
having the portdrv driver calling the services directly.  This will get the
state saved as desired, while making the relationship between the port
driver and the services under it more explicit in the code.
