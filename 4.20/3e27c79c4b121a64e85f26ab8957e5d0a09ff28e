OPP: Fix parsing of multiple phandles in "operating-points-v2" property

We currently return error if more than one phandle is present in the
"operating-points-v2" property, which is incorrect. We only want to
check the count of phandles here and set index to 0 if only one phandle
is present.

Fix it.
