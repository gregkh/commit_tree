efi/x86: Call efi_parse_options() from efi_main()

Before this commit we were only calling efi_parse_options() from
make_boot_params(), but make_boot_params() only gets called if the
kernel gets booted directly as an EFI executable. So when booted through
e.g. grub we ended up not parsing the commandline in the boot code.

This makes the drivers/firmware/efi/libstub code ignore the "quiet"
commandline argument resulting in the following message being printed:
"EFI stub: UEFI Secure Boot is enabled."

Despite the quiet request. This commits adds an extra call to
efi_parse_options() to efi_main() to make sure that the options are
always processed. This fixes quiet not working.

This also fixes the libstub code ignoring nokaslr and efi=nochunk.
