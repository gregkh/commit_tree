Input: synaptics - enable RMI on ThinkPad T560

Before commit 7fd6d98b89f3 ("i2c: i801: Allow ACPI AML access I/O
ports not reserved for SMBus"), enabling RMI on the T560 would cause
the touchpad to stop working after resuming from suspend. Now that
this issue is fixed, RMI can be enabled safely and works fine.
