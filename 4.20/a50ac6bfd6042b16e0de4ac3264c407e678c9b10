PCI: Simplify disconnected marking

Commit 89ee9f768003 ("PCI: Add device disconnected state") iterates over
the devices on a parent bus, marks each as disconnected, then marks
each device's children as disconnected using pci_walk_bus().

The same can be achieved more succinctly by calling pci_walk_bus() on
the parent bus.  Moreover, this does not need to wait until acquiring
pci_lock_rescan_remove(), so move it out of that critical section.

The critical section in err.c contains a pci_dev_get() / pci_dev_put()
pair which was apparently copy-pasted from pciehp_pci.c.  In the latter
it serves the purpose of holding the struct pci_dev in place until the
Command register is updated.  err.c doesn't do anything like that, hence
the pair is unnecessary.  Remove it.
