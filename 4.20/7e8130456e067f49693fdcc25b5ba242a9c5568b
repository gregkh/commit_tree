kvm: arm64: Configure VTCR_EL2.SL0 per VM

VTCR_EL2 holds the following key stage2 translation table
parameters:
  SL0  - Entry level in the page table lookup.
  T0SZ - Denotes the size of the memory addressed by the table.

We have been using fixed values for the SL0 depending on the
page size as we have a fixed IPA size. But since we are about
to make it dynamic, we need to calculate the SL0 at runtime
per VM. This patch adds a helper to compute the value of SL0
for a VM based on the IPA size.
