clk: qcom: Add Krait clock controller driver

The Krait CPU clocks are made up of a primary mux and secondary
mux for each CPU and the L2, controlled via cp15 accessors. For
Kraits within KPSSv1 each secondary mux accepts a different aux
source, but on KPSSv2 each secondary mux accepts the same aux
source.
