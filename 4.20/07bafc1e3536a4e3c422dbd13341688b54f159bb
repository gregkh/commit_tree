mmc: sunxi: Use new timing mode for A64 eMMC controller

The eMMC controller is also a new timing mode controller, but it doesn't
have the timing mode switch. It does however have signal delay and
calibration controls, typical of Allwinner MMC controllers that support
the new timing mode.

Enable the new timing mode setting for the A64 eMMC controller. This
also enables MMC HS-DDR modes, which gives higher throughput for eMMC
chips that support it, and can deliver such throughput.
