vfs: dedupe should return EPERM if permission is not granted

Right now we return EINVAL if a process does not have permission to dedupe a
file. This was an oversight on my part. EPERM gives a true description of
the nature of our error, and EINVAL is already used for the case that the
filesystem does not support dedupe.
