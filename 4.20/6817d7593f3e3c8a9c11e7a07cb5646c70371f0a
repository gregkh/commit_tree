ASoC: rsnd: enable TDM settings for SSI parent

Some SSIs are sharing each pins (= WS/CLK pin for playback/capture).
Then, SSI parent needs control WS/CLK setting for SSI slave.
In such case, SSI parent needs TDM settings if SSI slave is working as
TDM mode. But it is not cared in current driver.
It can't capture TDM sound without this patch if SSIs were pin sharing.
This patch is tested on R-Car H3 ulcb-kf board, SSI3/4 with TDM sound.
