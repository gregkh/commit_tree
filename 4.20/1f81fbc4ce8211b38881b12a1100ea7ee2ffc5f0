drm/radeon: change function signature to pass full range

In function ‘radeon_process_i2c_ch’ a comparison of a u8 value against
255 is done. Since it is always false, change the signature of this
function to use an `int` instead, which match the type used in caller:
`radeon_atom_hw_i2c_xfer`.

Fix the following warning triggered with W=1:

  CC [M]  drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/atombios_i2c.o
  drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/atombios_i2c.c: In function ‘radeon_process_i2c_ch’:
  drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/atombios_i2c.c:71:11: warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type [-Wtype-limits]
   if (num > ATOM_MAX_HW_I2C_READ) {
           ^
