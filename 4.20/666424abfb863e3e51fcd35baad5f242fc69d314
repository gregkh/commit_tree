drm/i915/execlists: Use coherent writes into the context image

That we use a WB mapping for updating the RING_TAIL register inside the
context image even on !llc machines has been a source of consternation
for every reader. It appears to work on bsw+, but it may just have been
that we have been incredibly bad at detecting the errors.

v2: With extra enthusiasm.
v3: Drop force of map type for pinned default_state as by the time we
pin it, the map type is always WB and doesn't conflict with the earlier
use by ce->state.
v4: Transfer engine->default_state from MAP_WC to MAP_WB on creation so
we do not need the MAP_FORCE littered around the backends
