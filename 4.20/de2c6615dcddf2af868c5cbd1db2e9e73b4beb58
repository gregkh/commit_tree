Btrfs: fix alignment in declaration and prototype of btrfs_get_extent

This fixes btrfs_get_extent to be consistent with our existing
declaration style.

Note: For the record, indentation styles that are accepted are both,
aligning under the opening ( and tab or double tab indentation on the
next line.  Preferrably not spliting the type or long expressions in the
argument lists.
