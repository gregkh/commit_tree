crypto: api - Introduce generic max blocksize and alignmask

In the quest to remove all stack VLA usage from the kernel[1], this
exposes a new general upper bound on crypto blocksize and alignmask
(higher than for the existing cipher limits) for VLA removal,
and introduces new checks.

At present, the highest cra_alignmask in the kernel is 63. The highest
cra_blocksize is 144 (SHA3_224_BLOCK_SIZE, 18 8-byte words). For the
new blocksize limit, I went with 160 (20 8-byte words).
