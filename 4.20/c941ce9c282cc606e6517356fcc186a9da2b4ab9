bpf: add verifier callback to get stack usage info for offloaded progs

In preparation for BPF-to-BPF calls in offloaded programs, add a new
function attribute to the struct bpf_prog_offload_ops so that drivers
supporting eBPF offload can hook at the end of program verification, and
potentially extract information collected by the verifier.

Implement a minimal callback (returning 0) in the drivers providing the
structs, namely netdevsim and nfp.

This will be useful in the nfp driver, in later commits, to extract the
number of subprograms as well as the stack depth for those subprograms.
