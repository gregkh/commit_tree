dt-bindings: display: atmel: optional video-interface of endpoints

With bus-type/bus-width properties in the endpoint nodes, the video-
interface of the connection can be specified for cases where the
heuristic fails to select the correct output mode. This can happen
e.g. if not all RGB pins are routed on the PCB; the driver has no
way of knowing this, and needs to be told explicitly.

This is critical for the devices that have the "conflicting output
formats" issue (SAM9N12, SAM9X5, SAMA5D3), since the most significant
RGB bits move around depending on the selected output mode. For
devices that do not have the "conflicting output formats" issue
(SAMA5D2, SAMA5D4), this is completely irrelevant.
