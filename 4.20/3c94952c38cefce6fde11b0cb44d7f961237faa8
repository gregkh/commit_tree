staging: vboxvideo: Skip currrent crtc when updating crtcs

In vbox_crtc_set_base_and_mode() we update all the crtcs when the
single_framebuffer setting changes, including the one on which
vbox_crtc_set_base_and_mode() was called, so we end up doing
vbox_do_modeset() on it twice. This commit skips the crtc on which
we are updating in the loop to update the other crtcs.

This commit also removes the vbox_set_view() call from the loop,
vbox_set_view() does not depend on the single_framebuffer setting and it
was being called on the passed in crtc parameter and not on the crtci
local iterator value (typo), so it was a no-op already.
