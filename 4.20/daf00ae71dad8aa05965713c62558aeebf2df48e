powerpc/traps: restore recoverability of machine_check interrupts

commit b96672dd840f ("powerpc: Machine check interrupt is a non-
maskable interrupt") added a call to nmi_enter() at the beginning of
machine check restart exception handler. Due to that, in_interrupt()
always returns true regardless of the state before entering the
exception, and die() panics even when the system was not already in
interrupt.

This patch calls nmi_exit() before calling die() in order to restore
the interrupt state we had before calling nmi_enter()
