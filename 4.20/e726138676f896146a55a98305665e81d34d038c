btrfs: Factor out loop processing all refs of a head

This patch introduces a new helper encompassing the implicit inner loop
in __btrfs_run_delayed_refs which processes all the refs for a given
head. The code is mostly copy/paste, the only difference is that if we
detect a newer reference then -EAGAIN is returned so that callers can
react correctly.

Also, at the end of the loop the head is relocked and
btrfs_merge_delayed_refs is run again to retain the pre-refactoring
semantics.
