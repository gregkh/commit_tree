bpf: fix bpf_prog_get_info_by_fd to return 0 func_lens for unpriv

While dbecd7388476 ("bpf: get kernel symbol addresses via syscall")
zeroed info.nr_jited_ksyms in bpf_prog_get_info_by_fd() for queries
from unprivileged users, commit 815581c11cc2 ("bpf: get JITed image
lengths of functions via syscall") forgot about doing so and therefore
returns the #elems of the user set up buffer which is incorrect. It
also needs to indicate a info.nr_jited_func_lens of zero.
