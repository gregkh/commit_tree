i2c: uniphier-f: fix race condition when IRQ is cleared

The current IRQ handler clears all the IRQ status bits when it bails
out. This is dangerous because it might clear away the status bits
that have just been set while processing the current handler. If this
happens, the IRQ event for the latest transfer is lost forever.

The IRQ status bits must be cleared *before* the next transfer is
kicked.
