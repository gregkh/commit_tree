x86/microcode: Make revision and processor flags world-readable

The microcode revision is already readable for non-root users via
/proc/cpuinfo. Thus, there's no reason to keep the same information
readable by root only in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/microcode/.

Make .../processor_flags world-readable too, while at it.
