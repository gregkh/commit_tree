init: add arch_call_rest_init to allow stack switching

With CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y the kernel stack of all tasks should be
allocated in the vmalloc space. The initial stack used for all
the early init code is in the init_thread_union. To be able to
switch from this early stack to a properly allocated stack
from vmalloc the architecture needs a switch-over point.

Introduce the arch_call_rest_init() function with a weak definition
in init/main.c with the only purpose to call rest_init() from the
end of start_kernel(). The architecture override can then do the
necessary magic to switch to the new vmalloc'ed stack.
