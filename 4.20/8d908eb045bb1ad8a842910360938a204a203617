s390/qeth: remove CARD_FROM_CDEV helper

The cdev-to-card translation walks through two layers of drvdata,
with no locking or refcounting (where eg. the ccwgroup core only
accesses a cdev's drvdata while holding the ccwlock).

This might be safe for now, but any careless usage of the helper has the
potential for subtle races and use-after-free's. Luckily there's only
one occurrence where we _really_ need it (in qeth_irq()), for any other
user we can just pass through an appropriate card pointer.
