IB/mlx5: Avoid load failure due to unknown link width

If the firmware reports a connection width that is not 1x, 4x, 8x or 12x
it causes the driver to fail during initialization.

To prevent this failure every time a new width is introduced to the RDMA
stack, we will set a default 4x width for these widths which ar unknown to
the driver.

This is needed to allow to run old kernels with new firmware.
