ravb: Disable Pause Advertisement

The previous commit to ravb had the side effect of making the PHY
advertise Pause and Asym Pause, which previously did not happen.  By
default, phydev->supported has both forms of pause enabled, but
phydev->advertising does not. The new phy_remove_link_mode() copies
phydev->supported to phydev->advertising after removing the requested
link mode. These Pause configuration bits appears it stops the PHY
from completing Auto-Neg and the link remains down.  Be explicit and
remove the Pause and Asym Pause modes, so restoring the old behavior.
