powerpc/8xx: change name of a few page flags to avoid confusion

_PAGE_PRIVILEGED corresponds to the SH bit which doesn't protect
against user access but only disables ASID verification on kernel
accesses. User access is controlled with _PMD_USER flag.

Name it _PAGE_SH instead of _PAGE_PRIVILEGED

_PAGE_HUGE corresponds to the SPS bit which doesn't really tells
that's it is a huge page but only that it is not a 4k page.

Name it _PAGE_SPS instead of _PAGE_HUGE
