usb: export firmware port location in sysfs

The platform firmware "location" data is used to find port peer
relationships. But firmware is an unreliable source, and there are
real world examples of errors leading to missing or wrong peer
relationships.  Debugging this is currently hard.

Exporting the location attribute makes it easier to spot mismatches
between the firmware data and the real world.
