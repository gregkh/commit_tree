ARM: 8816/1: dma-mapping: fix potential uninitialized return

While trying to use the dma_mmap_*() interface, it was noticed that this
interface returns strange values when passed an incorrect length.

If neither of the if() statements fire then the return value is
uninitialized. In the worst case it returns 0 which means the caller
will think the function succeeded.
