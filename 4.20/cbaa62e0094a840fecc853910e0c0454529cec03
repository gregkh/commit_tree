spi: add software implementation for SPI_CS_WORD

This adds a default software implementation for the SPI_CS_WORD flag for
controllers that don't have such a feature.

The SPI_CS_WORD flag indicates that the CS line should be toggled
between each word sent, not just between each transfer. The
implementation works by using existing functions to split transfers into
one-word-sized transfers and sets the cs_change bit for each of the
new transfers.
