net/sched: act_gact: disallow 'goto chain' on fallback control action

in the following command:

 # tc action add action <c1> random <rand_type> <c2> <rand_param>

'goto chain x' is allowed only for c1: setting it for c2 makes the kernel
crash with NULL pointer dereference, since TC core doesn't initialize the
chain handle.
