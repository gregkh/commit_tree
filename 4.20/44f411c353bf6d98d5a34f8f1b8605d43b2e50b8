NFSv4.x: fix lock recovery during delegation recall

Running "./nfstest_delegation --runtest recall26" uncovers that
client doesn't recover the lock when we have an appending open,
where the initial open got a write delegation.

Instead of checking for the passed in open context against
the file lock's open context. Check that the state is the same.
