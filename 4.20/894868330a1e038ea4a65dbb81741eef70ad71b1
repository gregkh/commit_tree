libceph: don't consume a ref on pagelist in ceph_msg_data_add_pagelist()

Because send_mds_reconnect() wants to send a message with a pagelist
and pass the ownership to the messenger, ceph_msg_data_add_pagelist()
consumes a ref which is then put in ceph_msg_data_destroy().  This
makes managing pagelists in the OSD client (where they are wrapped in
ceph_osd_data) unnecessarily hard because the handoff only happens in
ceph_osdc_start_request() instead of when the pagelist is passed to
ceph_osd_data_pagelist_init().  I counted several memory leaks on
various error paths.

Fix up ceph_msg_data_add_pagelist() and carry a pagelist ref in
ceph_osd_data.
