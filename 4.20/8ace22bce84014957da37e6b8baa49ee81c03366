hugetlbfs: call VM_BUG_ON_PAGE earlier in free_huge_page()

A stack trace was triggered by VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_mapcount(page), page)
in free_huge_page().  Unfortunately, the page->mapping field was set to
NULL before this test.  This made it more difficult to determine the
root cause of the problem.

Move the VM_BUG_ON_PAGE tests earlier in the function so that if they do
trigger more information is present in the page struct.
