MIPS: Loongson-3: Fix BRIDGE irq delivery problem

After commit e509bd7da149dc349160 ("genirq: Allow migration of chained
interrupts by installing default action") Loongson-3 fails at here:

setup_irq(LOONGSON_HT1_IRQ, &cascade_irqaction);

This is because both chained_action and cascade_irqaction don't have
IRQF_SHARED flag. This will cause Loongson-3 resume fails because HPET
timer interrupt can't be delivered during S3. So we set the irqchip of
the chained irq to loongson_irq_chip which doesn't disable the chained
irq in CP0.Status.
