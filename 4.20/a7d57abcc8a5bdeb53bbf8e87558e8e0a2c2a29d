xhci: workaround CSS timeout on AMD SNPS 3.0 xHC

Occasionally AMD SNPS 3.0 xHC does not respond to
CSS when set, also it does not flag anything on SRE and HCE
to point the internal xHC errors on USBSTS register. This stalls
the entire system wide suspend and there is no point in stalling
just because of xHC CSS is not responding.

To work around this problem, if the xHC does not flag
anything on SRE and HCE, we can skip the CSS
timeout and allow the system to continue the suspend. Once the
system resume happens we can internally reset the controller
using XHCI_RESET_ON_RESUME quirk
