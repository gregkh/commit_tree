lib/crc32: make core crc32() routines weak so they can be overridden

Allow architectures to drop in accelerated CRC32 routines by making
the crc32_le/__crc32c_le entry points weak, and exposing non-weak
aliases for them that may be used by the accelerated versions as
fallbacks in case the instructions they rely upon are not available.
