rcu: Remove rsp parameter from __rcu_process_callbacks()

There now is only one rcu_state structure in a given build of the
Linux kernel, so there is no need to pass it as a parameter to RCU's
functions.  This commit therefore removes the rsp parameter from
__rcu_process_callbacks(), and also inlines it into rcu_process_callbacks(),
removing the for_each_rcu_flavor() while in the neighborhood.
