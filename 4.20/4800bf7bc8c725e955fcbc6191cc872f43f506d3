block: fix 32 bit overflow in __blkdev_issue_discard()

A discard cleanup merged into 4.20-rc2 causes fstests xfs/259 to
fall into an endless loop in the discard code. The test is creating
a device that is exactly 2^32 sectors in size to test mkfs boundary
conditions around the 32 bit sector overflow region.

mkfs issues a discard for the entire device size by default, and
hence this throws a sector count of 2^32 into
blkdev_issue_discard(). It takes the number of sectors to discard as
a sector_t - a 64 bit value.

The commit ba5d73851e71 ("block: cleanup __blkdev_issue_discard")
takes this sector count and casts it to a 32 bit value before
comapring it against the maximum allowed discard size the device
has. This truncates away the upper 32 bits, and so if the lower 32
bits of the sector count is zero, it starts issuing discards of
length 0. This causes the code to fall into an endless loop, issuing
a zero length discards over and over again on the same sector.
