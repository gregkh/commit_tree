usb: typec: tcpm: Fix APDO PPS order checking to be based on voltage

Current code mistakenly checks against max current to determine
order but this should be max voltage. This commit fixes the issue
so order is correctly determined, thus avoiding failure based on
a higher voltage PPS APDO having a lower maximum current output,
which is actually valid.
