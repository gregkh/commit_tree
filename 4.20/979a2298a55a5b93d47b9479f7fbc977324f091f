clk: renesas: r8a77965: Add OSC EXTAL predivider configuration

R-Car Gen3 Hardware Manual Rev.0.52 documents the relation between the
MD13 and MD14 mode pins, and the OSC EXTAL predivider, as used by the
OSC and RINT RCLK clocks.  Hence augment the configuration structure
with all documented predivider values.

According to R-Car Gen3 Hardware Manual Rev.1.00, R-Car M3-N does not
have the CPG_RCKCR register.  Change the OSC and RINT clock definitions
to use the OSC EXTAL predivider instead, which is supported on all R-Car
M3-N SoC revisions.
