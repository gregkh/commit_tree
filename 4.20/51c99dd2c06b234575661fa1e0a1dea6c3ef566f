cpufreq: dt: Try freeing static OPPs only if we have added them

We can not call dev_pm_opp_of_cpumask_remove_table() freely anymore
since the latest OPP core updates as that uses reference counting to
free resources. There are cases where no static OPPs are added (using
DT) for a platform and trying to remove the OPP table may end up
decrementing refcount which is already zero and hence generating
warnings.

Lets track if we were able to add static OPPs or not and then only
remove the table based on that. Some reshuffling of code is also done to
do that.
