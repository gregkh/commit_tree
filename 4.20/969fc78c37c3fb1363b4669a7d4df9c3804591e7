soc: qcom: geni: geni_se_clk_freq_match() should always accept multiples

The geni_se_clk_freq_match() has some strange semantics.  Specifically
it is defined with two modes:
1. It can find a clock that's an exact multiple of the requested rate
2. It can find a non-exact match but it can't handle multiples then

...but callers should always be able to handle a clock that is a
multiple of the requested clock so mode #2 doesn't really make sense.
Let's change the semantics so that the non-exact match can also accept
multiples and then change the code to handle that.

The only caller of this code is the unlanded SPI driver [1] which
currently passes "exact = True", thus it should be safe to change the
semantics in this way.  ...and, in fact, the SPI driver should likely
be modified to pass "exact = False" (with the new semantics) since
that will allow it to work with SPI devices that request a clock rate
that doesn't exactly match a rate we can make.
