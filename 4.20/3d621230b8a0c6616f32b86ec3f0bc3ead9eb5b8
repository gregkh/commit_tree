smb3: update default requested iosize to 4MB from 1MB for recent dialects

Modern servers often support 8MB as maximum i/o size, and we see some
performance benefits (my testing showed 1 to 13% on write paths,
and 1 to 3% on read paths for increasing the default to 4MB). If server
doesn't support larger i/o size, during negotiate protocol it is already
set correctly to the server's maximum if lower than 4MB.
