parisc: Fix A500 boot crash

I believe the following change will fix the cache/TLB inconsistency
observed by Meelis.  After changing the page table entries, we need to
flush the cache and TLB to ensure that we don't have any stale PTE
values in the cache or TLB.

The alternative patching is done after all CPUs are running.  Thus, we
need to flush the whole cache and TLB.

I included the init section in the range modified by map_pages as
suggested by Helge.  Some routines in the init section may require
patching.
