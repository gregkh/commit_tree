Compiler Attributes: remove unneeded tests

Attributes const and always_inline have tests around them
which are unneeded, since they are supported by gcc >= 4.6,
clang >= 3 and icc >= 13. https://godbolt.org/z/DFPq37

In the case of gnu_inline, we do not need to test for
__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__ because, regardless of the current
inlining behavior, we can simply always force the old
GCC inlining behavior by using the attribute in all cases.
