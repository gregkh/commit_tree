arm64: hibernate: Avoid sending cross-calling with interrupts disabled

Since commit 3b8c9f1cdfc50 ("arm64: IPI each CPU after invalidating the
I-cache for kernel mappings"), a call to flush_icache_range() will use
an IPI to cross-call other online CPUs so that any stale instructions
are flushed from their pipelines. This triggers a WARN during the
hibernation resume path, where flush_icache_range() is called with
interrupts disabled and is therefore prone to deadlock:

  | Disabling non-boot CPUs ...
  | CPU1: shutdown
  | psci: CPU1 killed.
  | CPU2: shutdown
  | psci: CPU2 killed.
  | CPU3: shutdown
  | psci: CPU3 killed.
  | WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at ../kernel/smp.c:416 smp_call_function_many+0xd4/0x350
  | Modules linked in:
  | CPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 4.20.0-rc4 #1

Since all secondary CPUs have been taken offline prior to invalidating
the I-cache, there's actually no need for an IPI and we can simply call
__flush_icache_range() instead.
