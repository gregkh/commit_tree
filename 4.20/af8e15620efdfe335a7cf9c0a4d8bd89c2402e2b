media: v4l: Remove support for crop default target in subdev drivers

The V4L2 sub-device API does not support the crop default target. A number
of drivers apparently still did support this, likely as it was needed by
the SoC camera framework. Drop support for the default crop rectaingle in
sub-device drivers, and use the bounds rectangle in SoC camera instead.
