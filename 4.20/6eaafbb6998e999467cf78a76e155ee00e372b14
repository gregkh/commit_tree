w1: IAD Register is yet readable trough iad sys file. Fix snprintf (%u for unsigned, count for max size).

IAD Register is yet readable trough the "iad" sys file.

A write to the "iad" sys file enables or disables the current
measurement, but it was not possible to get the measured value by
reading it.
Fix: %u in snprintf for unsigned values (vdd and vad)
Fix: Avoid possibles overflows (Usage of the 'count' variables)
