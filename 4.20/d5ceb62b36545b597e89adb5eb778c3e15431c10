perf ordered_events: Add 'struct ordered_events_buffer' layer

When ordering events, we use preallocated buffers to store separate
events.  Those buffers currently don't have their own struct, but since
they are basically an array of 'struct ordered_event' objects, we use
the first event to hold buffers data - list head, that holds all buffers
together:

   struct ordered_events {
     ...
     struct ordered_event *buffer;
     ...
   };

   struct ordered_event {
     u64               timestamp;
     u64               file_offset;
     union perf_event  *event;
     struct list_head  list;
   };

This is quite convoluted and error prone as demonstrated by free-ing
issue discovered and fixed by Stephane in here [1].

This patch adds the 'struct ordered_events_buffer' object, that holds
the buffer data and frees it up properly.
