drm/i915/execlists: Apply a full mb before execution for Braswell

Braswell is really picky about having our writes posted to memory before
we execute or else the GPU may see stale values. A wmb() is insufficient
as it only ensures the writes are visible to other cores, we need a full
mb() to ensure the writes are in memory and visible to the GPU.

The most frequent failure in flushing before execution is that we see
stale PTE values and execute the wrong pages.
