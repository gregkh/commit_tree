media: v4l2-fwnode: Switch to v4l2_async_notifier_add_subdev

The fwnode endpoint and reference parsing functions in v4l2-fwnode.c
are modified to make use of v4l2_async_notifier_add_subdev().
As a result the notifier->subdevs array is no longer allocated or
re-allocated, and by extension the max_subdevs value is also no
longer needed.

Callers of the fwnode endpoint and reference parsing functions must now
first initialize the notifier with a call to v4l2_async_notifier_init().
This includes the function v4l2_async_register_subdev_sensor_common(),
and the intel-ipu3, omap3isp, and rcar-vin drivers.

Since the notifier->subdevs array is no longer allocated in the
fwnode endpoint and reference parsing functions, the callers of
those functions must never reference that array, since it is now
NULL. Of the drivers that make use of the fwnode/ref parsing,
only the intel-ipu3 driver references the ->subdevs[] array,
(in the notifier completion callback), so that driver has been
modified to iterate through the notifier->asd_list instead.
