x86/mm: Move LDT remap out of KASLR region on 5-level paging

On 5-level paging the LDT remap area is placed in the middle of the KASLR
randomization region and it can overlap with the direct mapping, the
vmalloc or the vmap area.

The LDT mapping is per mm, so it cannot be moved into the P4D page table
next to the CPU_ENTRY_AREA without complicating PGD table allocation for
5-level paging.

The 4 PGD slot gap just before the direct mapping is reserved for
hypervisors, so it cannot be used.

Move the direct mapping one slot deeper and use the resulting gap for the
LDT remap area. The resulting layout is the same for 4 and 5 level paging.
