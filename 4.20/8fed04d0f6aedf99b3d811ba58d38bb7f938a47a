powerpc/64s/hash: remove user SLB data from the paca

User SLB mappig data is copied into the PACA from the mm->context so
it can be accessed by the SLB miss handlers.

After the C conversion, SLB miss handlers now run with relocation on,
and user SLB misses are able to take recursive kernel SLB misses, so
the user SLB mapping data can be removed from the paca and accessed
directly.
