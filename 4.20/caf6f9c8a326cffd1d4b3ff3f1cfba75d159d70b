asm-generic: Remove unneeded __ARCH_WANT_SYS_LLSEEK macro

The sys_llseek sytem call is needed on all 32-bit architectures and
none of the 64-bit ones, so we can remove the __ARCH_WANT_SYS_LLSEEK guard
and simplify the include/asm-generic/unistd.h header further.

Since 32-bit tasks can run either natively or in compat mode on 64-bit
architectures, we have to check for both !CONFIG_64BIT and CONFIG_COMPAT.

There are a few 64-bit architectures that also reference sys_llseek
in their 64-bit ABI (e.g. sparc), but I verified that those all
select CONFIG_COMPAT, so the #if check is still correct here. It's
a bit odd to include it in the syscall table though, as it's the
same as sys_lseek() on 64-bit, but with strange calling conventions.
