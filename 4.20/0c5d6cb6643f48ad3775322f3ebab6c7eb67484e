cifs: fix return value for cifs_listxattr

If the application buffer was too small to fit all the names
we would still count the number of bytes and return this for
listxattr. This would then trigger a BUG in usercopy.c

Fix the computation of the size so that we return -ERANGE
correctly when the buffer is too small.

This fixes the kernel BUG for xfstest generic/377
