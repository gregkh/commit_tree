staging: gasket: interrupt: simplify interrupt init parameters

Pass the gasket driver descriptor to the interrupt init function, rather
than exploding out separate parameters from various fields of that
structure.  This allows us to make more localized changes to the types
of interrupts supported (MSIX vs. wire, etc.) without affecting the
calling sequence, and seems nicer for simplification purposes.
