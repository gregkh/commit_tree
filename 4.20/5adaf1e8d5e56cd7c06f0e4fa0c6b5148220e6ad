scsi: ufs: make UFS Tx lane1 clock optional for QCOM platforms

Per Qcom's UFS host controller HW design, the UFS Tx lane1 clock could be
muxed with Tx lane0 clock, hence keep Tx lane1 clock optional by ignoring
it if it is not provided in device tree. This change also performs some
cleanup to lanes per direction checks when enable/disable lane clocks
just for symmetry.
