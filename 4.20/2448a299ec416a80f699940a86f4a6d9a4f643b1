virtio/s390: avoid race on vcdev->config

Currently we have a race on vcdev->config in virtio_ccw_get_config() and
in virtio_ccw_set_config().

This normally does not cause problems, as these are usually infrequent
operations. However, for some devices writing to/reading from the config
space can be triggered through sysfs attributes. For these, userspace can
force the race by increasing the frequency.
