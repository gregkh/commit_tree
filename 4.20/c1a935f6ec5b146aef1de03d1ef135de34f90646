s390/qeth: fix discipline unload after setup error

Device initialization code usually first loads a subdriver
(via qeth_core_load_discipline()), and then runs its setup() callback.
If this fails, it rolls back the load via qeth_core_free_discipline().

qeth_core_free_discipline() expects the options.layer attribute to be
initialized, but on error in setup() that's currently not the case.
Resulting in misbalanced symbol_put() calls.

Fix this by setting options.layer when loading the subdriver.
