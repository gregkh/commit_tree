staging: wlan-ng: rename DIDmib_lnx_lnxConfigTable_lnxRSNAIE in p80211metadef.h

Rename DIDmib_lnx_lnxConfigTable_lnxRSNAIE in p80211metadef.h to
DIDMIB_LNX_CONFIGTABLE_RSNAIE to fix "Avoid CamelCase" message from
checkpatch and conform to the coding style guidelines. Also shorten
name by removing repeated use of "LNX" to ease readability and reduce
long lines.
