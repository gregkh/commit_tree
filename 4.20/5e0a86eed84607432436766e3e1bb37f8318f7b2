scsi: ufs: Add API to execute raw upiu commands

The UFS host software uses a combination of a host register set and
Transfer Request Descriptors in system memory to communicate with host
controller hardware. In its mmio space, a separate places are assigned
to UTP Transfer Request Descriptor ("utrd") list, and to UTP Task
Management Request Descriptor ("utmrd") list.

The provided API supports utrd-typed requests: nop out and device
management commands. It also supports utmrd-type requests:
task management requests. Other UPIU types are not supported for now.

We utilize the already existing code for tag and task work queues.
That is, all utrd-typed UPIUs are "disguised" as device management
commands. Similarly, the utmrd-typed UPUIs uses the task management
infrastructure.

It is up to the caller to fill the upiu request properly, as it will be
copied without any further input validations.
