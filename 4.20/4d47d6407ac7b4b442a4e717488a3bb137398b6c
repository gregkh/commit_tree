perf/x86/intel/uncore: Support CoffeeLake 8th CBOX

Coffee Lake has 8 core products which has 8 Cboxes. The 8th CBOX is
mapped into different MSR space.

Increase the num_boxes to 8 to handle the new products. It will not
impact the previous platforms, SkyLake, KabyLake and earlier CoffeeLake.
Because the num_boxes will be recalculated in uncore_cpu_init and
doesn't exceed the x86_max_cores.

Introduce a new box flag bit to indicate the 8th CBOX.
