powerpc/numa: Suppress "VPHN is not supported" messages

When VPHN function is not supported and during cpu hotplug event,
kernel prints message 'VPHN function not supported. Disabling
polling...'. Currently it prints on every hotplug event, it floods
dmesg when a KVM guest tries to hotplug huge number of vcpus, let's
just print once and suppress further kernel prints.
