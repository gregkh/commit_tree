l2tp: fix a sock refcnt leak in l2tp_tunnel_register

This issue happens when trying to add an existent tunnel. It
doesn't call sock_put() before returning -EEXIST to release
the sock refcnt that was held by calling sock_hold() before
the existence check.

This patch is to fix it by holding the sock after doing the
existence check.
