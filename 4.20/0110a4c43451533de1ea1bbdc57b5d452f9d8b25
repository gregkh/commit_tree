btrfs: refactor __btrfs_run_delayed_refs loop

Refactor the delayed refs loop by using the newly introduced
btrfs_run_delayed_refs_for_head function. This greatly simplifies
__btrfs_run_delayed_refs and makes it more obvious what is happening.

We now have 1 loop which iterates the existing delayed_heads and then
each selected ref head is processed by the new helper. All existing
semantics of the code are preserved so no functional changes.
