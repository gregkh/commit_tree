drm/amd/display: Raise dispclk value for dce_update_clocks

[Why]

The DISPCLK value was previously requested to be 15% higher for all
ASICS that went through the dce110 bandwidth code path. As part of a
refactoring of dce_clocks and dce110 set_bandwidth this was removed
for power saving considerations.

This changed caused corruption under certain display configurations.
Originally thought to be Vega specific, it was also observed on Polaris.

[How]

The 15% is brought back but its placement differs from the original
patch. This boost should only be enable while DFS bypass is inactive.

This (like the Vega patch) is also a workaround that should be
removed after the root cause is identified.
