swiotlb: add support for non-coherent DMA

Handle architectures that are not cache coherent directly in the main
swiotlb code by calling arch_sync_dma_for_{device,cpu} in all the right
places from the various dma_map/unmap/sync methods when the device is
non-coherent.

Because swiotlb now uses dma_direct_alloc for the coherent allocation
that side is already taken care of by the dma-direct code calling into
arch_dma_{alloc,free} for devices that are non-coherent.
