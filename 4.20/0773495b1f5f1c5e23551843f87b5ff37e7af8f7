xtensa: make sure bFLT stack is 16 byte aligned

Xtensa ABI requires stack alignment to be at least 16. In noMMU
configuration ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN is used to align stack. Make it at
least 16.

This fixes the following runtime error in noMMU configuration, caused by
interaction between insufficiently aligned stack and alloca function,
that results in corruption of on-stack variable in the libc function
glob:

 Caught unhandled exception in 'sh' (pid = 47, pc = 0x02d05d65)
  - should not happen
  EXCCAUSE is 15
