brcmfmac: fix full timeout waiting for action frame on-channel tx

The driver sends an action frame down and waits for a completion signal
triggered by the received BRCMF_E_ACTION_FRAME_OFF_CHAN_COMPLETE event
to continue the process. However, the action frame could be transmitted
either on the current channel or on an off channel. For the on-channel
case, only BRCMF_E_ACTION_FRAME_COMPLETE event will be received when
the frame is transmitted, which make the driver always wait a full
timeout duration. This patch has the completion signal be triggered by
receiving the BRCMF_E_ACTION_FRAME_COMPLETE event for the on-channel
case.

This change fixes WFA p2p certification 5.1.19 failure.
