net: phy: mscc: fix signedness bug in vsc85xx_downshift_get

Currently, the error handling for the call to function
phy_read_paged() doesn't work because *reg_val* is of
type u16 (16 bits, unsigned), which makes it impossible
for it to hold a value less than 0.

Fix this by changing the type of variable *reg_val* to int.
