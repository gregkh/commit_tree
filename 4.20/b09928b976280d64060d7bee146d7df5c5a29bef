bpf: make direct packet write unclone more robust

Given this seems to be quite fragile and can easily slip through the
cracks, lets make direct packet write more robust by requiring that
future program types which allow for such write must provide a prologue
callback. In case of XDP and sk_msg it's noop, thus add a generic noop
handler there. The latter starts out with NULL data/data_end unconditionally
when sg pages are shared.
