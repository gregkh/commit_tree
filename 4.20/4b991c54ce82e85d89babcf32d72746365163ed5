gpu: drm: radeon: radeon_test: Replace mdelay() with msleep()

radeon_test_ring_sync() and radeon_test_ring_sync2() are never
called in atomic context.
They call mdelay() to busily wait, which is not necessary.
mdelay() can be replaced with msleep().

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
