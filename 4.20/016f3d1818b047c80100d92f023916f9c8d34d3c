vxlan: reduce dirty cache line in vxlan_find_mac

vxlan_find_mac() unconditionally set f->used for every packet,
this causes a cache miss for every packet, since remote, hlist
and used of vxlan_fdb share the same cache line, which are
accessed when send every packets.

so f->used is set only if not equal to jiffies, to reduce dirty
cache line times, this gives 3% speed-up with small packets.
