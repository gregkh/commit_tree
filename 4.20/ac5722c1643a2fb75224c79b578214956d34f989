Input: cros_ec_keyb - fix button/switch capability reports

The cros_ec_keyb_bs array lists buttons and switches together, expecting
that its users will match the appropriate type and bit fields. But
cros_ec_keyb_register_bs() only checks the 'bit' field, which causes
misreported input capabilities in some cases. For example, tablets
(e.g., Scarlet -- a.k.a. Acer Chromebook Tab 10) were reporting a SW_LID
capability, because EC_MKBP_POWER_BUTTON and EC_MKBP_LID_OPEN happen to
share the same bit.

(This has comedic effect on a tablet, in which a power-management daemon
then thinks this "lid" is closed, and so puts the system to sleep as
soon as it boots!)

To fix this, check both the 'ev_type' and 'bit' fields before reporting
the capability.

Tested with a lid (Kevin / Samsung Chromebook Plus) and without a lid
(Scarlet / Acer Chromebook Tab 10).

This error got introduced when porting the feature from the downstream
Chromium OS kernel to be upstreamed.
