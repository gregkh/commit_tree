bpf/verifier: add ARG_PTR_TO_UNINIT_MAP_VALUE

ARG_PTR_TO_UNINIT_MAP_VALUE argument is a pointer to a memory zone
used to save the value of a map.  Basically the same as
ARG_PTR_TO_UNINIT_MEM, but the size has not be passed as an extra
argument.

This will be used in the following patch that implements some new
helpers that receive a pointer to be filled with a map value.
