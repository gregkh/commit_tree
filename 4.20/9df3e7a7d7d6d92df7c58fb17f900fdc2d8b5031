kbuild: add -Wno-unused-but-set-variable flag unconditionally

We have raised the compiler requirement from time to time.
With commit cafa0010cd51 ("Raise the minimum required gcc version
to 4.6"), the minimum for GCC is 4.6 now.

This flag was added by GCC 4.6, and it is recognized by ICC as well.

It is true that Clang does not support this flag but this commit is
just touching the else part of the "ifeq ($(cc-name),clang)" check.
Hence, Clang build is not affected.

Let's rip off the cc-disable-warning switch, and see if somebody
complains about it.
