drm/i915: Pull intel_uncore_arm_unclaimed_mmio_detection() under the spinlock

Elsewhere we manipulate uncore.unclaimed_mmio_check and
i915_param.mmio_debug under the irq lock (e.g. preserving the current
value across a user forcewake grab), but do not protect the manipulation
inside intel_uncore_arm_unclaimed_mmio_detection() from concurrent
access, even from itself. This is an issue as we do call
arm_unclaimed_mmio_detection from multiple threads without coordination.
