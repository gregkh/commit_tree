powerpc/boot: Fix opal console in boot wrapper

As of commit 10c77dba40ff ("powerpc/boot: Fix build failure in 32-bit
boot wrapper") the opal code is hidden behind CONFIG_PPC64_BOOT_WRAPPER,
but the boot wrapper avoids include/linux, so it does not get the normal
Kconfig flags.

We can drop the guard entirely as in commit f8e8e69cea49 ("powerpc/boot:
Only build OPAL code when necessary") the makefile only includes opal.c
in the build if CONFIG_PPC64_BOOT_WRAPPER is set.
