mlxsw: spectrum: Enable VxLAN enslavement to bridges

Enslavement of VxLAN devices to offloaded bridges was never forbidden by
mlxsw, but this patch makes sure the required configuration is performed
in order to allow VxLAN encapsulation and decapsulation to take place in
the device.

The patch handles both the case where a VxLAN device is enslaved to an
already offloaded bridge and the case where the first mlxsw port is
enslaved to a bridge that already has VxLAN device configured.

Invalid configurations are sanitized and an error string is returned via
extack.

Since encapsulation and decapsulation do not occur when the VxLAN device
is down, the driver makes sure to enable / disable these functionalities
based on NETDEV_PRE_UP and NETDEV_DOWN events.

Note that NETDEV_PRE_UP is used in favor of NETDEV_UP, as the former
allows to veto the operation, if necessary.
