ARM: dts: exynos: Fix regulators configuration on Peach Pi/Pit Chromebooks

Regulators, which are marked as 'on-in-suspend' seems to be critical for
board operation, thus they must not be disabled anytime. This can be
only assured by marking them as 'always-on', because otherwise some
actions of their clients might result in turning them off. This patch
restores suspend/resume operation on Peach-Pit Chromebook board. It
partially reverts 'always-on' property removal done by the commit
mentioned in the Fixes tag.
