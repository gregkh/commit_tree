regulator: axp20x: Mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases
where we are expecting to fall through.

Notice that in this particular case, I moved the whole comment
"Fall through to the check below.", which contains the "Fall through"
comment, at the bottom of the case, which is what GCC is expecting
to find.
