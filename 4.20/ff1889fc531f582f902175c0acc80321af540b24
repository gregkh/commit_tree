bpf: show main program address and length in bpf_prog_info

Currently, when there is no subprog (prog->aux->func_cnt == 0),
bpf_prog_info does not return any jited_ksyms or jited_func_lens. This
patch adds main program address (prog->bpf_func) and main program
length (prog->jited_len) to bpf_prog_info.
