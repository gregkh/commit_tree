HID: Add quirk for Primax PIXART OEM mice

The PixArt OEM mice are known for disconnecting every minute in
runlevel 1 or 3 if they are not always polled. So add quirk
ALWAYS_POLL for two Primax mice as well.

0x4e22 is the Dell MS111-P and 0x4d0f is the unbranded HP Portia
mouse HP 697738-001. Both were built until approx. 2014.
Those were the standard mice from those vendors and are still
around - even as new old stock.
