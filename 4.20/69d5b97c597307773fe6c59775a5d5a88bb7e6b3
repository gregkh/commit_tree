HID: we do not randomly make new drivers 'default y'

.. even when that "default y" is hidden syntactically as a

	default !EXPERT

it's wrong.

The only reason something should be 'default y' is if it used to be
built-in, and it was made configurable, and the 'default y' is just
retaining the status quo.

Altheratively, the hardware for the driver has become _so_ common that
it really makes sense for everybody to build it.  Finally, one possible
reason for 'default y' is because the option is not enabling any new
code at all, but is just enabling other options (the networking people
do this for vendor options, for example, so that you can disable whole
vendors at a time).

Clearly, none of these cases hold for the BigBen Interactive Kids'
gamepad, and HID_BIGBEN_FF should thus most definitely not default
to on for everybody.
