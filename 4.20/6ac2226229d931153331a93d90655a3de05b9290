perf tools: Fix undefined symbol scnprintf in libperf-jvmti.so

Currently jvmti agent can not be used because function scnprintf is not
present in the agent libperf-jvmti.so. As a result the JVM when using
such agent to record JITed code profiling information will fail on
looking up scnprintf:

  java: symbol lookup error: lib/libperf-jvmti.so: undefined symbol: scnprintf

This commit fixes that by reverting to the use of snprintf, that can be
looked up, instead of scnprintf, adding a proper check for the returned
value in order to print a better error message when the jitdump file
pathname is too long. Checking the returned value also helps to comply
with some recent gcc versions, like gcc8, which will fail due to
truncated writing checks related to the -Werror=format-truncation= flag.
