pstore/ram: Correctly calculate usable PRZ bytes

The actual number of bytes stored in a PRZ is smaller than the
bytes requested by platform data, since there is a header on each
PRZ. Additionally, if ECC is enabled, there are trailing bytes used
as well. Normally this mismatch doesn't matter since PRZs are circular
buffers and the leading "overflow" bytes are just thrown away. However, in
the case of a compressed record, this rather badly corrupts the results.

This corruption was visible with "ramoops.mem_size=204800 ramoops.ecc=1".
Any stored crashes would not be uncompressable (producing a pstorefs
"dmesg-*.enc.z" file), and triggering errors at boot:

  [    2.790759] pstore: crypto_comp_decompress failed, ret = -22!

Backporting this depends on commit 70ad35db3321 ("pstore: Convert console
write to use ->write_buf")
