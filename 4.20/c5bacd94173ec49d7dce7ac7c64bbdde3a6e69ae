rcu: Motivate Tiny RCU forward progress

If a long-running CPU-bound in-kernel task invokes call_rcu(), the
callback won't be invoked until the next context switch.  If there are
no other runnable tasks (which is not an uncommon situation on deep
embedded systems), the callback might never be invoked.

This commit therefore causes rcu_check_callbacks() to ask the scheduler
for a context switch if there are callbacks posted that are still waiting
for a grace period.
