s390/pkey: Introduce new API for transforming key blobs

Introduce a new ioctl API and in-kernel API to transform
a variable length key blob of any supported type into a
protected key.

Transforming a secure key blob uses the already existing
function pkey_sec2protk().
Transforming a protected key blob also verifies if the
protected key is still valid. If not, -ENODEV is returned.

Both APIs are described in detail in the header files
arch/s390/include/asm/pkey.h and arch/s390/include/uapi/asm/pkey.h.
