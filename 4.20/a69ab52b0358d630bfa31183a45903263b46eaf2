drm/i915: Remove extra waiter kick on legacy resets

Now with a more efficacious workaround for the lost interrupts after
reset, we can remove the hack of kicking the waiters after reset. The
issue was that the kick only worked for the immediate window after the
reset (those seqno that would complete in the time it took for the
waiter thread to perform its check) but miss any seqno that lacked an
interrupt afterwards.
