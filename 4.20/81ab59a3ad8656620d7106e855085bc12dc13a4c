rcu: Remove rsp parameter from dump_blkd_tasks() and friend

There now is only one rcu_state structure in a given build of the
Linux kernel, so there is no need to pass it as a parameter to RCU's
functions.  This commit therefore removes the rsp parameter from
dump_blkd_tasks() and rcu_preempt_blocked_readers_cgp().
