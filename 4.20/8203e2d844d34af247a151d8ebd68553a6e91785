net: clear skb->tstamp in forwarding paths

Sergey reported that forwarding was no longer working
if fq packet scheduler was used.

This is caused by the recent switch to EDT model, since incoming
packets might have been timestamped by __net_timestamp()

__net_timestamp() uses ktime_get_real(), while fq expects packets
using CLOCK_MONOTONIC base.

The fix is to clear skb->tstamp in forwarding paths.

Fixes: 80b14dee2bea ("net: Add a new socket option for a future transmit time.")
Fixes: fb420d5d91c1 ("tcp/fq: move back to CLOCK_MONOTONIC")
