CIFS: make 'nodfs' mount opt a superblock flag

tcon->Flags is only used by SMB1 code and changing it is not permanent
(you lose the setting on tcon reconnect).

* Move the setting to superblock flags (per mount-points).
* Make automount callback exit early when flag present
* Make dfs resolving happening in mount syscall exit early if flag present
