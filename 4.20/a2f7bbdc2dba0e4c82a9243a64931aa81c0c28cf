IB/hfi1: Rework the IRQ API to be more flexible

The current IRQ API is an all or nothing interface.  This has two
problems:

  1. All IRQs are enabled regardless of use
  2. Moving from general interrupt to MSIx handling is difficult

Introduce a new API to enable/disable specific IRQs or a range of IRQs.

Do not enable and disable all IRQs in one step.

Rework various modules to enable/disable IRQs when needed.
