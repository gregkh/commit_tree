clocksource/drivers/sh_cmt: Properly line-wrap sh_cmt_of_table[] initializer

There's no good reason for the sh_cmt_of_table[] initializer to
violate the 80-column limit, especially after the commit 8d50e9476bb4
("clocksource/drivers/sh_cmt: Mark "renesas,cmt-48-gen2" deprecated")
partially fixed it -- fix the R-Car gen2 related entries as well.
