ALSA: memalloc: Simplify snd_malloc_dev_pages() calls

snd_malloc_dev_pages() and snd_free_dev_pages() are local functions
and the parameters passed there are all contained in snd_dma_buffer
object.  As a code-simplification, pass snd_dma_buffer object and
assign the address there like other allocators do (except for
snd_malloc_pages() which is called from outside, hence we can't change
easily).

Only code refactoring, no functional changes.
