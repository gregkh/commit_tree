HID: wacom: Work around HID descriptor bug in DTK-2451 and DTH-2452

The DTK-2451 and DTH-2452 have a buggy HID descriptor which incorrectly
contains a Cintiq-like report, complete with pen tilt, rotation, twist, serial
number, etc. The hardware doesn't actually support this data but our driver
duitifully sets up the device as though it does. To ensure userspace has a
correct view of devices without updated firmware, we clean up this incorrect
data in wacom_setup_device_quirks.

We're also careful to clear the WACOM_QUIRK_TOOLSERIAL flag since its presence
causes the driver to wait for serial number information (via
wacom_wac_pen_serial_enforce) that never comes, resulting in
the pen being non-responsive.
