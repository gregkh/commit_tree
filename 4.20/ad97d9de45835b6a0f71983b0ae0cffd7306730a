drm/amdgpu: Add delay after enable RLC ucode

Driver shouldn't try to access any GFX registers until RLC is idle.
During the test, it took 12 seconds for RLC to clear the BUSY bit
in RLC_GPM_STAT register which is un-acceptable for driver.
As per RLC engineer, it would take RLC Ucode less than 10,000 GFXCLK
cycles to finish its critical section. In a lowest 300M enginer clock
setting(default from vbios), 50 us delay is enough.

This commit fix the hang when RLC introduce the work around for XGMI
which requires more cycles to setup more registers than normal
