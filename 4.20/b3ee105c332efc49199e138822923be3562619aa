staging: wilc1000: refactor code to move initilization in wilc_netdev_init()

Refactor code to move the initialization of wilc related parameters in
wilc_netdev_init() and move their deinitialization in
wilc_netdev_cleanup(). For 'hif_workqueue' creation 'clients_count' check
is not required as the single instance is maintained.
