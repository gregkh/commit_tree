intel-ethernet: use correct module license

We recently updated all our SPDX identifiers to correctly
indicate our net/ethernet/intel/* drivers were always released
and intended to be released under GPL v2, but the MODULE_LICENSE
declaration was never updated.

Fix the MODULE_LICENSE to be GPL v2, for all our drivers.
