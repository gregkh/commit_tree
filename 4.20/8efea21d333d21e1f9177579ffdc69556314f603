bpf/verifier: display non-spill stack slot types in print_verifier_state

If a stack slot does not hold a spilled register (STACK_SPILL), then each
 of its eight bytes could potentially have a different slot_type.  This
 information can be important for debugging, and previously we either did
 not print anything for the stack slot, or just printed fp-X=0 in the case
 where its first byte was STACK_ZERO.
Instead, print eight characters with either 0 (STACK_ZERO), m (STACK_MISC)
 or ? (STACK_INVALID) for any stack slot which is neither STACK_SPILL nor
 entirely STACK_INVALID.
