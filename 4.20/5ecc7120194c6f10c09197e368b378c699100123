coresight: Cleanup coresight DT bindings

The coresight drivers relied on default bindings for graph
in DT, while reusing the "reg" field of the "ports" to indicate
the actual hardware port number for the connections. This can
cause duplicate ports with same addresses, but different
direction. However, with the rules getting stricter for the
address mismatch with the label, it is no longer possible to use
the port address field for the hardware port number.

This patch introduces new DT binding rules for coresight
components, based on the same generic DT graph bindings, but
avoiding the address duplication.

- All output ports must be specified under a child node with
  name "out-ports".
- All input ports must be specified under a childe node with
  name "in-ports".
- Port address should match the hardware port number.

The support for legacy bindings is retained, with a warning.
