page cache: Add and replace pages using the XArray

Use the XArray APIs to add and replace pages in the page cache.  This
removes two uses of the radix tree preload API and is significantly
shorter code.  It also removes the last user of __radix_tree_create()
outside radix-tree.c itself, so make it static.
