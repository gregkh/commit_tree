net: hns3: Fix ets validate issue

There is a defect in hclge_ets_validate(). If each member of tc_tsa is
not IEEE_8021QAZ_TSA_ETS, the variable total_ets_bw won't be updated.
In this case, the check for value of total_ets_bw will fail. This patch
fixes it by checking total_ets_bw only after it has been updated.
