hfs: fix return value of hfs_get_block()

Direct writes to empty inodes fail with EIO.  The generic direct-io code
is in part to blame (a patch has been submitted as "direct-io: allow
direct writes to empty inodes"), but hfs is worse affected than the other
filesystems because the fallback to buffered I/O doesn't happen.

The problem is the return value of hfs_get_block() when called with
!create.  Change it to be more consistent with the other modules.
