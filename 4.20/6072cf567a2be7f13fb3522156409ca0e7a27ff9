of: ignore sub-page memory regions

Memory region size is rounded down to page boundary and with sub-page
region it becomes 0 and there is no point to add an empty region.
Moreover, when the base is less than PAGE_SIZE we get a bogus size as
(base + size - 1) evaluates to -1.

8cccffc52694 ("of: check for size < 0 after rounding in
early_init_dt_add_memory_arch") introduced a test for wrap around for the
case when base is not page aligned, the same test can be used to ignore
sub-page region sizes.
