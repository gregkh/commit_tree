scsi: libsas: always unregister the old device if going to discover new

If we went into sas_rediscover_dev() the attached_sas_addr was already insured
not to be zero. So it's unnecessary to check if the attached_sas_addr is zero.

And although if the sas address is not changed, we always have to unregister
the old device when we are going to register a new one. We cannot just leave
the device there and bring up the new.
