net: bridge: convert and rename mcast disabled

Convert mcast disabled to an option bit and while doing so convert the
logic to check if multicast is enabled instead. That is make the logic
follow the option value - if it's set then mcast is enabled and vice versa.
This avoids a few confusing places where we inverted the value that's being
set to follow the mcast_disabled logic.
