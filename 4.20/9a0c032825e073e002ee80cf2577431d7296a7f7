arm64: Use daifflag_restore after bp_hardening

For EL0 entries requiring bp_hardening, daif status is kept at
DAIF_PROCCTX_NOIRQ until after hardening has been done. Then interrupts
are enabled through local_irq_enable().

Before using local_irq_* functions, daifflags should be properly restored
to a state where IRQs are enabled.

Enable IRQs by restoring DAIF_PROCCTX state after bp hardening.
