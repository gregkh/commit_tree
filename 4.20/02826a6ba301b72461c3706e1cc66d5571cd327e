Ard Biesheuvel reports bindeb-pkg with O= option is broken in the
following way:

Prior to commit 80463f1b7bf9 ("kbuild: add --include-dir flag only
for out-of-tree build"), both srctree and objtree were added to
--include-dir redundantly, and the wrong code '$MAKE image_name'
was working by relying on that. Now, the potential issue that had
previously been hidden just showed up.

'$MAKE image_name' recurses to the generated $(objtree)/Makefile and
ends up with running in srctree, which is incorrect. It should be
invoked with '-f $srctree/Makefile' (or KBUILD_SRC=) to be executed
in objtree.
