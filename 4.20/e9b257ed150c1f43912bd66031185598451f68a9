mm/memcontrol.c: fix memory.stat item ordering

The refault stats go better with the page fault stats, and are of
higher interest than the stats on LRU operations. In fact they used to
be grouped together; when the LRU operation stats were added later on,
they were wedged in between.

Move them back together. Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.rst
already lists them in the right order.
