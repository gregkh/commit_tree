platform/x86: mlx-platform: Properly use mlxplat_mlxcpld_msn201x_items

Clang warns that mlxplat_mlxcpld_msn201x_items is not going to be
emitted in the final assembly because it's only used in ARRAY_SIZE right
now, which is a compile time evaluation since the array's size is known.

drivers/platform/x86/mlx-platform.c:555:32: warning: variable
'mlxplat_mlxcpld_msn201x_items' is not needed and will not be emitted
[-Wunneeded-internal-declaration]
static struct mlxreg_core_item mlxplat_mlxcpld_msn201x_items[] = {
                               ^
1 warning generated.

It appears this was a copy and paste mistake from when this item was
first added. Use the definition in mlxplat_mlxcpld_msn201x_data so that
Clang no longer warns.
