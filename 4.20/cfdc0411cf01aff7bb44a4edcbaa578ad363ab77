clk: bulk: add of_clk_bulk_get()

'clock-names' property is optional in DT, so of_clk_bulk_get() is
introduced here to handle this for DT users without 'clock-names'
specified. Later clk_bulk_get_all() will be implemented on top of
it and this API will be kept private until someone proves they need
it because they don't have a struct device pointer.
