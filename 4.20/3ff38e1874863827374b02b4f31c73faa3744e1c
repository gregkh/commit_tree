powerpc/book3s64: fix dump_linuxpagetables "present" flag

Since commit bd0dbb73e013 ("powerpc/mm/books3s: Add new pte bit to
mark pte temporarily invalid."), _PAGE_PRESENT doesn't mean exactly
that a page is present. A page is also considered preset when
_PAGE_INVALID is set.

This patch changes the meaning of "present" and adds a status "valid"
associated to the _PAGE_PRESENT flag.
