rcu: Convert rcu_state.ofl_lock to raw_spinlock_t

1e64b15a4b10 ("rcu: Fix grace-period hangs due to race with CPU offline")
added spinlock_t ofl_lock to the rcu_state structure, then takes it with
preemption disabled during CPU offline, which gives the -rt patchset's
sleeping spinlock heartburn.

This commit therefore converts ->ofl_lock to raw_spinlock_t.
