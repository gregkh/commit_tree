drm/i915/dp: Improve clock recovery loop limit comment

Clarifies the clock recovery loop limit comment that 80
max_cr_tries for pre-DP1.4 devices was chosen as a very
tolerant upper bound.
Assumptions made:
- DP1.4 syncs should be smarter so they won't need more
than 10 tries
- pre-DP1.4 syncs should be compliant enough to not need
that many tries (80) but we should tolerate any that may
trigger this corner case
