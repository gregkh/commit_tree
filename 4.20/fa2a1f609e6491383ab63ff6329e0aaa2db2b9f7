kyber: don't make domain token sbitmap larger than necessary

The domain token sbitmaps are currently initialized to the device queue
depth or 256, whichever is larger, and immediately resized to the
maximum depth for that domain (256, 128, or 64 for read, write, and
other, respectively). The sbitmap is never resized larger than that, so
it's unnecessary to allocate a bitmap larger than the maximum depth.
Let's just allocate it to the maximum depth to begin with. This will use
marginally less memory, and more importantly, give us a more appropriate
number of bits per sbitmap word.
