x86/kvm/lapic: preserve gfn_to_hva_cache len on cache reinit

vcpu->arch.pv_eoi is accessible through both HV_X64_MSR_VP_ASSIST_PAGE and
MSR_KVM_PV_EOI_EN so on migration userspace may try to restore them in any
order. Values match, however, kvm_lapic_enable_pv_eoi() uses different
length: for Hyper-V case it's the whole struct hv_vp_assist_page, for KVM
native case it is 8. In case we restore KVM-native MSR last cache will
be reinitialized with len=8 so trying to access VP assist page beyond
8 bytes with kvm_read_guest_cached() will fail.

Check if we re-initializing cache for the same address and preserve length
in case it was greater.
