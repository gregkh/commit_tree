iwlwifi: pcie: avoid unnecessary work if NIC is disconnected

When the NIC is disconnected from PCI bus, we are not
able to access it anymore. Check the status to avoid
some unnecessary work so can improve the performance.
It will help to make PCI bus rescan to bring back the
device much faster.

The real test is able to improve 7 seconds.

[w/o patch] It takes around 9 seconds
