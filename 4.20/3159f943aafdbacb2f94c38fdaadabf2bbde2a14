xarray: Replace exceptional entries

Introduce xarray value entries and tagged pointers to replace radix
tree exceptional entries.  This is a slight change in encoding to allow
the use of an extra bit (we can now store BITS_PER_LONG - 1 bits in a
value entry).  It is also a change in emphasis; exceptional entries are
intimidating and different.  As the comment explains, you can choose
to store values or pointers in the xarray and they are both first-class
citizens.
