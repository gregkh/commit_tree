media: v4l: fwnode: Read lane inversion information despite lane numbering

Read the lane inversion independently of whether the "data-lanes" property
exists. This makes sense since the caller may pass the number of lanes as
the default configuration while the lane inversion configuration may still
be available in firmware.
