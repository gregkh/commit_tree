EDAC, altera: Combine Stratix10 and Arria10 probe functions

On Stratix10, the ECC offsets are similar to the existing
Arria10 functions and this can be leveraged to simplify
the EDAC driver as follows:

1. Fold Stratix10 specifics into Arria10 structures and
functions.

2. Implement the Stratix10 System Manager register accesses
using a custom regmap to allow use with the Arria10 System
Manager regmaps.

3. Stratix10 double bit errors are implemented as SError
instead of interrupts so use a panic notifier.
