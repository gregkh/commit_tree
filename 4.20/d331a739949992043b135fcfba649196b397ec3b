batman-adv: Provide debug messages as trace events

A private debug logging infrastructure is currently provided via
$debug_fs/batman_adv/*/log when CONFIG_BATMAN_ADV_DEBUG is enabled. This is
not well integrated in the rest of the tracing infrastructure of the
kernel.

Other components (like mac80211 or ath10k) allow to gather the debug
messages using generic trace events which are better integrated. This makes
it possible to interact with them using the existing userspace tools.

The tracepoint batadv:batadv_dbg will now be available when
CONFIG_BATMAN_ADV_DEBUG and CONFIG_BATMAN_ADV_TRACING is activated. The log
level mask is still used for filtering as usual.

A full system trace for offline parsing can be created (and read) using:

  $ batctl ll all
  $ trace-cmd record -e batadv:batadv_dbg
  $ trace-cmd report

The same can also be done without recording to a file

  $ batctl ll all
  $ trace-cmd stream -e batadv:batadv_dbg

The trace infrastructure is especially helpful when tracing processes:

  $ batctl ll all
  $ ./tools/perf/perf trace --event "batadv:*" batctl p 10.204.32.1
