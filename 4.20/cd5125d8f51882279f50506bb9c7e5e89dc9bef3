netfilter: nf_tables: split set destruction in deactivate and destroy phase

Splits unbind_set into destroy_set and unbinding operation.

Unbinding removes set from lists (so new transaction would not
find it anymore) but keeps memory allocated (so packet path continues
to work).

Rebind function is added to allow unrolling in case transaction
that wants to remove set is aborted.

Destroy function is added to free the memory, but this could occur
outside of transaction in the future.
