block: Improve zone reset execution

There is no need to synchronously execute all REQ_OP_ZONE_RESET BIOs
necessary to reset a range of zones. Similarly to what is done for
discard BIOs in blk-lib.c, all zone reset BIOs can be chained and
executed asynchronously and a synchronous call done only for the last
BIO of the chain.

Modify blkdev_reset_zones() to operate similarly to
blkdev_issue_discard() using the next_bio() helper for chaining BIOs. To
avoid code duplication of that function in blk_zoned.c, rename
next_bio() into blk_next_bio() and declare it as a block internal
function in blk.h.
