SUNRPC: The transmitted message must lie in the RPCSEC window of validity

If a message has been encoded using RPCSEC_GSS, the server is
maintaining a window of sequence numbers that it considers valid.
The client should normally be tracking that window, and needs to
verify that the sequence number used by the message being transmitted
still lies inside the window of validity.

So far, we've been able to assume this condition would be realised
automatically, since the client has been encoding the message only
after taking the socket lock. Once we change that condition, we
will need the explicit check.
