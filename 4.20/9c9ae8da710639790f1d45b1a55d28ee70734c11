thermal/drivers/hisi: Change the driver to be sensor oriented

In order to support multiple sensors, we have to change the code to
deal with sensors and not the hisi thermal structure.

Add a back pointer to the hisi thermal structure (containerof is not a
good option because later we convert the sensor field to a pointer).

Change the functions parameters to take a sensor instead of this hisi
thermal 'data' structure.
