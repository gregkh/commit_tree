mtd: rawnand: marvell: document a bit more the driver

A stale document about the old pxa3cc_nand.c driver is available in
Documentation/mtd/nand/. Rewrite the parts that explain the IP itself
and some non-trivial choices made in the driver directly in
marvell_nand.c to then be able to remove this file.
