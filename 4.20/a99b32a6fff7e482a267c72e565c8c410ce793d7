drm/i915: Clear stop-engine for a pardoned reset

If we pardon a per-engine reset, we may leave the STOP_RING bit asserted
in RING_MI_MODE resulting in the engine hanging. Unconditionally clear
it on the per-engine exit path as we know that either we skipped the
reset and so need the cancellation, or the reset was successful and the
cancellation is a no-op, or there was an error and we will follow up
with a full-reset or wedging (both of which will stop the engines again
as required).
