rcutorture: Force occasional reader waits

Deferred quiescent states can interact with the scheduler, but
rcu_torture_reader() does not force such interaction all that frequently.
This commit therefore blocks for one jiffy after ten jiffies of read-side
runtime.  This has the beneficial effect of being most likely to block
just after long-running readers, and it is exactly these readers that
are most likely to have been preempted (in CONFIG_PREEMPT=y kernels).
This in turn helps increase the probability that a deferred quiescent
state will be seen by RCU's context-switch hooks.
