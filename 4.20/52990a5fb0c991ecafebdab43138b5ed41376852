block: setup bounce bio_sets properly

We're only setting up the bounce bio sets if we happen
to need bouncing for regular HIGHMEM, not if we only need
it for ISA devices.

Protect the ISA bounce setup with a mutex, since it's
being invoked from driver init functions and can thus be
called in parallel.
