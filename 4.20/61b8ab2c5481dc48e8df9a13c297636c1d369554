hwmon: (core) Add trace events to _attr_show/store functions

Trace events are useful for people who collect data from the
Ftrace outputs. There're people who analyse the relationship
of cpufreq, thermal and hwmon (power/voltage/current) using
the convenient and timestamped Ftrace outputs, while unlike
cpufreq and thermal subsystems the hwmon does not have trace
events supported yet.

So this patch adds initial trace events for the hwmon core.
To call hwmon_attr_base() for aligned attr index numbers, it
also moves the function upward.

Ftrace outputs:
 ...: hwmon_attr_show_string: index=2, attr_name=in2_label, val=VDD_5V
 ...: hwmon_attr_show: index=2, attr_name=in2_input, val=5112
 ...: hwmon_attr_show: index=2, attr_name=curr2_input, val=440

Note that the _attr_show and _attr_store functions are tied
to the _with_info API. So a hwmon driver requiring the trace
events feature should use _with_info API to register a hwmon
device.
