iio: adc: meson-saradc: simplify access to meson_sar_adc_param

Commit 053ffe3c8cfe31 ("iio: adc: meson-saradc: squash and share the
common adc platform data") put all the data which is needed at runtime
from struct meson_sar_adc_data to a new struct meson_sar_adc_param so
we can re-use the platform specific configuration without having to
duplicate everything just to change the name.

The only place where struct meson_sar_adc_data is now needed is the
_probe function which has to pass the name to the iio_dev. All other
functions only need access to struct meson_sar_adc_param. This means we
can simplify struct meson_sar_adc_priv.

The goal of this patch is to make the code a bit easier to read since
this removes one level of nesting. No functional changes intended.
