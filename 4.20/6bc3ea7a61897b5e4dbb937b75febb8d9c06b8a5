media: i2c: adv748x: Handle TX[A|B] power management

As the driver is now allowed to probe with a single output endpoint,
power management routines shall now take into account the case a CSI-2 TX
is not enabled.

Unify the adv748x_tx_power() routine to handle transparently TXA and TXB,
and enable the CSI-2 outputs conditionally.
