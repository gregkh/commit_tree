udf: Drop freed bitmap / table support

We don't support Free Space Table and Free Space Bitmap as specified by
UDF standard for writing as we don't support erasing blocks before
overwriting them. Just drop the handling of these structures as
partition descriptor checking code already makes sure such filesystems
can be mounted only read-only.
