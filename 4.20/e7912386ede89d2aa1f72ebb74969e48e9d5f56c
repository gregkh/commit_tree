KVM: x86: reintroduce pte_list_remove, but including mmu_spte_clear_track_bits

rmap_remove() removes the sptep after locating the correct rmap_head but,
in several cases, the caller has already known the correct rmap_head.

This patch introduces a new pte_list_remove(); because it is known that
the spte is present (or it would not have an rmap_head), it is safe
to remove the tracking bits without any previous check.
