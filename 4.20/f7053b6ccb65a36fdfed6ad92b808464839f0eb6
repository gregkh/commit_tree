tuntap: simplify error handling in tun_build_skb()

There's no need to duplicate page get logic in each action. So this
patch tries to get page and calculate the offset before processing XDP
actions (except for XDP_DROP), and undo them when meet errors (we
don't care the performance on errors). This will be used for factoring
out XDP logic.
