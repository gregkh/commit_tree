Revert "dmaengine: imx-sdma: alloclate bd memory from dma pool"

This reverts commit fe5b85c656bc. The SDMA engine needs the descriptors to
be contiguous in memory. As the dma pool API is only able to provide a
single descriptor per alloc invocation there is no guarantee that multiple
descriptors satisfy this requirement. Also the code in question is broken
as it only allocates memory for a single descriptor, without looking at the
number of descriptors required for the transfer, leading to out-of-bounds
accesses when the descriptors are written.
