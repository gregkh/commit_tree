platform/x86: acerhdf: Enable ability to list supported systems

This driver has two module parameters that allow an override of the
checks for matching model and BIOS version.  However, both parameters
expect you to choose an entry from the existing list of supported
systems, encoded within the driver itself.

Without the source, such as in a binary distribution, the end user
does not have access to this information, thus rendering the two
module parameters essentially useless.

Add a module parameter that allows the end user to dump the list
of make/model/versions so that they can then pick one that most
closely matches their own system.
