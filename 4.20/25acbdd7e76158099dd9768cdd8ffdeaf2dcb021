vmw_balloon: rename VMW_BALLOON_2M_SHIFT to VMW_BALLOON_2M_ORDER

The name of the macro'd VMW_BALLOON_2M_SHIFT is misleading. The value
reflects 2M huge-page order. Unfortunately, we cannot use
HPAGE_PMD_ORDER, since it is not defined when transparent huge-pages are
off, so we need to define our own one.

Rename it to VMW_BALLOON_2M_ORDER. No functional change.
