drm/i915: Check fb stride against plane max stride

commit 4e0b83a567e2 ("drm/i915: Extract per-platform plane->check()
functions") removed the plane max stride check for sprite planes.
I was going to add it back when introducing GTT remapping for the
display, but after further thought it seems better to re-introduce
it separately.

So let's add the max stride check back. And let's do it in a nicer
form than what we had before and do it for all plane types (easy
now that we have the ->max_stride() plane vfunc).

Only sprite planes really need this for now since primary planes
are capable of scanning out the current max fb size we allow, and
cursors have more stringent stride checks elsewhere.
