selftests: forwarding: lib: Add mtu_set(), mtu_restore()

Some selftests need to tweak MTU of an interface, and naturally should
at teardown restore the MTU back to the original value. Add two
functions to facilitate this MTU handling: mtu_set() to change MTU
value, and mtu_reset() to change it back to what it was before.
