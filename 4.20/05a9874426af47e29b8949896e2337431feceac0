scsi: aacraid: remove unused variables dev and cpu

Variables dev and cpu are not being used and are redundant and hence can
be removed.

Cleans up clang warnings:
warning: variable 'dev' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
warning: variable 'cpu' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
