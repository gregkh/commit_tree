tools: bpftool: add map create command

Add a way of creating maps from user space.  The command takes
as parameters most of the attributes of the map creation system
call command.  After map is created its pinned to bpffs.  This makes
it possible to easily and dynamically (without rebuilding programs)
test various corner cases related to map creation.

Map type names are taken from bpftool's array used for printing.
In general these days we try to make use of libbpf type names, but
there are no map type names in libbpf as of today.

As with most features I add the motivation is testing (offloads) :)
