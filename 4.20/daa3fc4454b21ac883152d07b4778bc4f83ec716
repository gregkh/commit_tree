media: vicodec: set state resolution from raw format

The state structure contains the resolution expected by the decoder
and encoder. For an encoder that resolution should be taken from the
OUTPUT format, and for a decoder from the CAPTURE format.

If the wrong format is picked, a buffer overrun can occur if there is
a mismatch between the CAPTURE and OUTPUT formats.

The real fix would be to correctly implement the stateful codec
specification, but that will take more time. For now just prevent the
buffer overrun.
