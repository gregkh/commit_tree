s390/qeth: invoke softirqs after napi_schedule()

Calling napi_schedule() from process context does not ensure that the
NET_RX softirq is run in a timely fashion. So trigger it manually.

This is no big issue with current code. A call to ndo_open() is usually
followed by a ndo_set_rx_mode() call, and for qeth this contains a
spin_unlock_bh(). Except for OSN, where qeth_l2_set_rx_mode() bails out
early.
Nevertheless it's best to not depend on this behaviour, and just fix
the issue at its source like all other drivers do. For instance see
commit 83a0c6e58901 ("i40e: Invoke softirqs after napi_reschedule").
