perf scripts python: exported-sql-viewer.py: Add All branches report

Add a report to display branches in a similar fashion to perf script. The
main purpose of this report is to display disassembly, however, presently,
the only supported disassembler is Intel XED, and additionally the object
code must be present in perf build ID cache.

To use Intel XED, libxed.so must be present. To build and install
libxed.so:
	git clone https://github.com/intelxed/mbuild.git mbuild
	git clone https://github.com/intelxed/xed
	cd xed
	./mfile.py --share
	sudo ./mfile.py --prefix=/usr/local install
	sudo ldconfig
