btrfs: Remove 'objectid' member from struct btrfs_root

There are two members in struct btrfs_root which indicate root's
objectid: objectid and root_key.objectid.

They are both set to the same value in __setup_root():

  static void __setup_root(struct btrfs_root *root,
                           struct btrfs_fs_info *fs_info,
                           u64 objectid)
  {
    ...
    root->objectid = objectid;
    ...
    root->root_key.objectid = objecitd;
    ...
  }

and not changed to other value after initialization.

grep in btrfs directory shows both are used in many places:
  $ grep -rI "root->root_key.objectid" | wc -l
  133
  $ grep -rI "root->objectid" | wc -l
  55
 (4.17, inc. some noise)

It is confusing to have two similar variable names and it seems
that there is no rule about which should be used in a certain case.

Since ->root_key itself is needed for tree reloc tree, let's remove
'objecitd' member and unify code to use ->root_key.objectid in all places.
