scsi: qla2xxx: Fix race condition for resource cleanup

For Loop topology + Initiator, FW is in control of PLOGI/PRLI.  When link is
reset, driver will try to cleanup the session by doing an Implicit Logout.
Instead, the code is doing an Explicit Logout.  The explicit logout interferes
with FW state machine in trying to reconnect.  The implicit logout was meant
for FW to flush commands.  In loop, it is not needed because FW will auto
flush.
