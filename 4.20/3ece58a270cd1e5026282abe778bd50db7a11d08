page cache: Convert find_get_pages_contig to XArray

There's no direct replacement for radix_tree_for_each_contig()
in the XArray API as it's an unusual thing to do.  Instead,
open-code a loop using xas_next().  This removes the only user of
radix_tree_for_each_contig() so delete the iterator from the API and
the test suite code for it.
