ice: Add support for dynamic interrupt moderation

Currently there is no support for dynamic interrupt moderation. This
patch adds some initial code to support this. The following changes
were made:

1. Currently we are using multiple members to store the interrupt
   granularity (itr_gran_25/50/100/200). This is not necessary because
   we can query the device to determine what the interrupt granularity
   should be set to, done by a new function ice_get_itr_intrl_gran.

2. Added intrl to ice_q_vector structure to support interrupt rate
   limiting.

3. Added the function ice_intrl_usecs_to_reg for converting to a value
   in usecs that the device understands.

4. Added call to write to the GLINT_RATE register. Disable intrl by
   default for now.

5. Changed rx/tx_itr_setting to itr_setting because having both seems
   redundant because a ring is either Tx or Rx.

6. Initialize itr_setting for both Tx/Rx rings in ice_vsi_alloc_rings()
