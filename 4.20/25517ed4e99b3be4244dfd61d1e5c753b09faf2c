MIPS: Let early memblock_alloc*() allocate memories bottom-up

After switched to NO_BOOTMEM, there are several boot failures. Some of
them have been fixed and some of them haven't. I find that many of them
are because of memory allocations are top-down, while the old behavior
is bottom-up. This patch let early memblock_alloc*() allocate memories
bottom-up to avoid some potential problems.
