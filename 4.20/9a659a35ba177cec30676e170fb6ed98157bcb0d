netlink: allow NLA_NESTED to specify nested policy to validate

Now that we have a validation_data pointer, and the len field in
the policy is unused for NLA_NESTED, we can allow using them both
to have nested validation. This can be nice in code, although we
still have to use nla_parse_nested() or similar which would also
take a policy; however, it also serves as documentation in the
policy without requiring a look at the code.
