KVM: leverage change to adjust slots->used_slots in update_memslots()

update_memslots() is only called by __kvm_set_memory_region(), in which
"change" is calculated and indicates how to adjust slots->used_slots

  * increase by one if it is KVM_MR_CREATE
  * decrease by one if it is KVM_MR_DELETE
  * not change for others

This patch adjusts slots->used_slots in update_memslots() based on "change"
value instead of re-calculate those states again.
