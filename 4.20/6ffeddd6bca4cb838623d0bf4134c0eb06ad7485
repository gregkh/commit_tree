clk: mvebu: ap806: Remove superfluous of_clk_add_provider

While applying the commit a8309cedcdce ("clk: apn806: Add eMMC clock to
system controller driver"), of_clk_add_provider was added wheres it was
already present in the probe function.

This extraneous call is harmless but not useful so remove it.
