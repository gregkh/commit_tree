RDMA/bnxt_re: QPLIB: Add and use #define dev_fmt(fmt) "QPLIB: " fmt

Consistently use the "QPLIB: " prefix for dev_<level> logging.

Miscellanea:

o Add missing newlines to avoid possible message interleaving
o Coalesce consecutive dev_<level> uses that emit a message header to
  avoid < 80 column lengths and mistakenly output on multiple lines
o Reflow modified lines to use 80 columns where appropriate
o Consistently use "%s: " where __func__ is output
o QPLIB: is now always output immediately after the dev_<level> header
