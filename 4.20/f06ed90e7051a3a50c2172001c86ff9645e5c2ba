OPP: Parse OPP table's DT properties from _of_init_opp_table()

Parse the DT properties present in the OPP table from
_of_init_opp_table(), which is a dedicated routine for DT parsing.

Minor relocation of helpers is required for this.

It is possible now for _managed_opp() to return a partially initialized
OPP table if the OPP table is created via the helpers like
dev_pm_opp_set_supported_hw() and we need another flag to indicate if
the static OPP are already parsed or not to make sure we don't
incorrectly skip initializing the static OPPs.
