KVM: s390: set host program identifier

A host program identifier (HPID) provides information regarding the
underlying host environment. A level-2 (VM) guest will have an HPID
denoting Linux/KVM, which is set during VCPU setup. A level-3 (VM on a
VM) and beyond guest will have an HPID denoting KVM vSIE, which is set
for all shadow control blocks, overriding the original value of the
HPID.
