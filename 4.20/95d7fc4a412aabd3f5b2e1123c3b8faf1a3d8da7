drm/amdgpu: Move fence SW fallback warning v3

Only print the warning if there was actually some fence processed
from the SW fallback timer.

v2: Add return value to amdgpu_fence_process to let
amdgpu_fence_fallback know fences were actually
processed and then print the warning.

v3: Always return true if seq != last_seq
