s390/appldata: do not use stack buffers for hardware data

With CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y the stack is allocated from the vmalloc space.
Data structures passed to a hardware or a hypervisor interface that
requires V=R can not be allocated on the stack anymore.

Use kmalloc to get memory for the appldata_product_id and the
appldata_parameter_list structures.
