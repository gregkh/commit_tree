gpiolib: check if irqchip already has the irq hook replacements

Some drivers use a single irqchip for multiple gpiochips. As a result the
irqchip hooks are overridden for the first gpiochip that was added, but
for the other gpiochip instances this should not happen again, otherwise
we would go into an infinite recursion.

Check for this, but also log a message that the driver should be fixed
since this is bad practice.
