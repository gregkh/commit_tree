drm/amd/display: Support amdgpu "max bpc" connector property (v2)

[Why]
Many panels support more than 8bpc but some modes are unavailable while
running at greater than 8bpc due to DP/HDMI bandwidth constraints.

Support for more than 8bpc was added recently in the driver but it
defaults to the maximum supported bpc - locking out these modes.

This should be a user configurable option such that the user can select
what bpc configuration they would like.

[How]
This patch adds support for getting and setting the amdgpu driver
specific "max bpc" property on the connector.

It also adds support for limiting the output bpc based on the property
value. The default limitation is the lowest value in the range, 8bpc.
This was the old value before the range was uncapped.

This patch should be updated/replaced later once common drm support
for max bpc lands.
