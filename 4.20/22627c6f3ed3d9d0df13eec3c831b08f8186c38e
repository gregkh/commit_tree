clocksource/drivers/sh_cmt: Fixup for 64-bit machines

When trying to use CMT for clockevents on R-Car gen3 SoCs, I noticed
that 'max_delta_ns' for the broadcast timer (CMT) was shown as 1000 in
/proc/timer_list. It turned out that when calculating it, the driver did
1 << 32 (causing what I think was undefined behavior) resulting in a zero
delta, later clamped to 1000 by cev_delta2ns(). The root cause turned out
to be that the driver abused *unsigned long* for the CMT register values
(which are 16/32-bit), so that the calculation of 'ch->max_match_value'
in sh_cmt_setup_channel() used the wrong branch. Using more proper 'u32'
instead fixed 'max_delta_ns' and even fixed the switching an active
clocksource to CMT (which caused the system to turn non-interactive
before).
