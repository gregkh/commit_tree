bpf: extend cgroup bpf core to allow multiple cgroup storage types

In order to introduce per-cpu cgroup storage, let's generalize
bpf cgroup core to support multiple cgroup storage types.
Potentially, per-node cgroup storage can be added later.

This commit is mostly a formal change that replaces
cgroup_storage pointer with a array of cgroup_storage pointers.
It doesn't actually introduce a new storage type,
it will be done later.

Each bpf program is now able to have one cgroup storage of each type.
