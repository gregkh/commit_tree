ARM: davinci: dm365: define gpio interrupts as separate resources

Since commit eb3744a2dd01 ("gpio: davinci: Do not assume continuous
IRQ numbering") the davinci GPIO driver fails to probe if we boot
in legacy mode from any of the board files. Since the driver now
expects every interrupt to be defined as a separate resource, split
the definition of IRQ resources instead of having a single continuous
interrupt range.
