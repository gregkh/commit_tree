drm/bridge/ti-sn65dsi86: Fix implicit declaration to drm_mode_connector_attach_encoder

This function name was changed to drm_connector_attach_encoder().
Unfortunately this driver was posted on the list before that change, and
applied after

Fixes: a095f15c00e2 ("drm/bridge: add support for sn65dsi86 bridge
driver")
