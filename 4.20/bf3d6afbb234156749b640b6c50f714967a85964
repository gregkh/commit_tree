powerpc: Look for "stdout-path" when setting up legacy consoles

Commit 78e5dfea84dc ("powerpc: dts: replace 'linux,stdout-path' with
'stdout-path'") broke the default console on a number of embedded
PowerPC systems, because it failed to also update the code in
arch/powerpc/kernel/legacy_serial.c to look for that property in
addition to the old one.

This fixes it.
