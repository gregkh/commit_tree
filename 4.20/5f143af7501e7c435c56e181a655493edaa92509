spi: make OF helper available for others

The of_find_spi_device_by_node() helper function is useful for other
modules too. Export the funciton as GPL like all other spi helper
functions and make it available if CONFIG_OF is enabled, because it isn't
related to the CONFIG_OF_DYNAMIC context. Finally add a stub if
CONFIG_OF isn't enabled, so others must not care about it.
