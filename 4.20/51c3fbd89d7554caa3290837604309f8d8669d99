x86/mm: Fix decoy address handling vs 32-bit builds

A decoy address is used by set_mce_nospec() to update the cache attributes
for a page that may contain poison (multi-bit ECC error) while attempting
to minimize the possibility of triggering a speculative access to that
page.

When reserve_memtype() is handling a decoy address it needs to convert it
to its real physical alias. The conversion, AND'ing with __PHYSICAL_MASK,
is broken for a 32-bit physical mask and reserve_memtype() is passed the
last physical page. Gert reports triggering the:

    BUG_ON(start >= end);

...assertion when running a 32-bit non-PAE build on a platform that has
a driver resource at the top of physical memory:

    BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000fff00000-0x00000000ffffffff] reserved

Given that the decoy address scheme is only targeted at 64-bit builds and
assumes that the top of physical address space is free for use as a decoy
address range, simply bypass address sanitization in the 32-bit case.

Lastly, there was no need to crash the system when this failure occurred,
and no need to crash future systems if the assumptions of decoy addresses
are ever violated. Change the BUG_ON() to a WARN() with an error return.
