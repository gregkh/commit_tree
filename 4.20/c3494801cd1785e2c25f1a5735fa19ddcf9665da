bpf: check pending signals while verifying programs

Malicious user space may try to force the verifier to use as much cpu
time and memory as possible. Hence check for pending signals
while verifying the program.
Note that suspend of sys_bpf(PROG_LOAD) syscall will lead to EAGAIN,
since the kernel has to release the resources used for program verification.
