Btrfs: extent_map: use rb_first_cached

rb_first_cached() trades an extra pointer "leftmost" for doing the
same job as rb_first() but in O(1).

As evict_inode_truncate_pages() removes all extent mapping by always
looking for the first rb entry, it's helpful to use rb_first_cached
instead.

For more details about the optimization see patch "Btrfs: delayed-refs:
use rb_first_cached for href_root".
