ia64: export node_distance function

The numa_slit variable used by node_distance is available to a
module as long as it is linked at compile-time. However, it is
not available to loadable modules. Leading to errors such as:

  ERROR: "numa_slit" [drivers/nvme/host/nvme-core.ko] undefined!

The error above is caused by the nvme multipath code that makes
use of node_distance for its path calculation. When the patch was
added, the lightnvm subsystem would select nvme and always compile
it in, leading to the node_distance call to always succeed.
However, when this requirement was removed, nvme could be compiled
in as a module, which exposed this bug.

This patch extracts node_distance to a function and exports it.
Since ACPI is depending on node_distance being a simple lookup to
numa_slit, the previous behavior is exposed as slit_distance and its
users updated.
