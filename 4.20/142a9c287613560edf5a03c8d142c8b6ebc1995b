IB/ipoib: Ensure that MTU isn't less than minimum permitted

It is illegal to change MTU to a value lower than the minimum MTU
stated in ethernet spec. In addition to that we need to add 4 bytes
for encapsulation header (IPOIB_ENCAP_LEN).

Before "ifconfig ib0 mtu 0" command, succeeds while it obviously shouldn't.
