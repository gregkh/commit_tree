nfp: provide a better warning when ring allocation fails

NFP supports fairly enormous ring sizes (up to 256k descriptors).
In commit 466271703867 ("nfp: use kvcalloc() to allocate SW buffer
descriptor arrays") we have started using kvcalloc() functions to
make sure the allocation of software state arrays doesn't hit
the MAX_ORDER limit.  Unfortunately, we can't use virtual mappings
for the DMA region holding HW descriptors.  In case this allocation
fails instead of the generic (and fairly scary) warning/splat in
the logs print a helpful message explaining what happened and
suggesting how to fix it.
