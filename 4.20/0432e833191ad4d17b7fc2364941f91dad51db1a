net: phy: realtek: fix RTL8201F sysfs name

Since 4.19 the following error in sysfs has appeared when using the
r8169 NIC driver:

$cd /sys/module/realtek/drivers
$ls -l
ls: cannot access 'mdio_bus:RTL8201F 10/100Mbps Ethernet': No such file or directory
[..garbled dir entries follow..]

Apparently the forward slash in "10/100Mbps Ethernet" is interpreted
as directory separator that leads nowhere, and was introduced in commit
513588dd44b ("net: phy: realtek: add RTL8201F phy-id and functions").

Fix this by removing the offending slash in the driver name.

Other drivers in net/phy seem to have the same problem, but I cannot
test/verify them.
