i2c: designware: Remove Cherry Trail PMIC I2C bus pm_disabled workaround

Commit a3d411fb38c0 ("i2c: designware: Disable pm for PMIC i2c-bus even if
there is no _SEM method"), always set the pm_disabled flag on the I2C7
controller, even if its bus was not shared with the PUNIT.

This was a workaround for various suspend/resume issues, after the
following 2 commits this workaround is no longer necessary:

Commit 541527728341 ("PM: i2c-designware-platdrv: Suspend/resume at the
                     late/early stages")
Commit e6ce0ce34f65 ("ACPI / LPSS: Add device link for CHT SD card
                     dependency on I2C")

Therefor this commit removes this workaround.

After this commit the pm_disabled flag is only used to indicate that the
bus is shared with the PUNIT and after other recent changes we no longer
call dev_pm_syscore_device(dev, true), so we are no longer actually
disabling (non-runtime) pm, so this commit also renames the flag to
shared_with_punit to better reflect what it is for.
