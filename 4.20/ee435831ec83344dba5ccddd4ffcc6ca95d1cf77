drm/i915/icl: account for context save/restore removed bits

The RS_CTX_ENABLE and CTX_SAVE_INHIBIT bits are not present on ICL
anymore, but we still try to set them and then check them with
GEM_BUG_ON, resulting in a BUG() call. The bug can be reproduced by
igt/drv_selftest/live_hangcheck/others-priority and our CI was able
to catch it.

It is worth noticing that commit 05f0addd9b10 ("drm/i915/icl: Enhanced
execution list support") already tried to avoid the save bits
on ICL, but only inside populate_lr_context().
