media: v4l: fwnode: The CSI-2 clock is continuous if it's not non-continuous

The continuous clock flag was only set if there was a clock or data lanes.
This isn't needed as such a configuration is invalid to begin with. Always
set the continuous clock flag if the non-continuous property is not found.
