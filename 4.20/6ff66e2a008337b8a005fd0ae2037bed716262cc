PM / devfreq: Don't adjust to user limits in governors

Several governors use the user space limits df->min/max_freq to adjust
the target frequency. This is not necessary, since update_devfreq()
already takes care of this. Instead the governor can request the available
min/max frequency by setting the target frequency to DEVFREQ_MIN/MAX_FREQ
and let update_devfreq() take care of any adjustments.
