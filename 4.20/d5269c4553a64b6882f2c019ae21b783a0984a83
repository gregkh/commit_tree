remoteproc: qcom: q6v5: Propagate EPROBE_DEFER

In the case that the interrupts fail to result because of the
interrupt-controller not yet being registered the
platform_get_irq_byname() call will fail with -EPROBE_DEFER, but passing
this into devm_request_threaded_irq() will result in -EINVAL being
returned, the driver is therefor not reprobed later.
