blk-iolatency: deal with small samples

There is logic to keep cgroups that haven't done a lot of IO in the most
recent scale window from being punished for over-active higher priority
groups.  However for things like ssd's where the windows are pretty
short we'll end up with small numbers of samples, so 5% of samples will
come out to 0 if there aren't enough.  Make the floor 1 sample to keep
us from improperly bailing out of scaling down.
