s390/qeth: unregister netdevice only when registered

qeth only registers its netdevice when the qeth device is first set
online. Thus a device that has never been set online will trigger
a WARN ("network todo 'hsi%d' but state 0") in unregister_netdev() when
removed.

Fix this by protecting the unregister step, just like we already protect
against repeated registering of the netdevice.
