media: ov5640: Re-work MIPI startup sequence

Rework the MIPI interface startup sequence with the following changes:

- Remove MIPI bus initialization from the initial settings blob
- At set_power(1) time power up MIPI Tx/Rx and set data and clock lanes in
  LP11 during 'sleep' and 'idle' with MIPI clock in non-continuous mode.
- At s_stream time enable/disable the MIPI interface output.
- Restore default settings at set_power(0) time.

Before this commit the sensor MIPI interface was initialized with settings
that require a start/stop sequence at power-up time in order to force lanes
into LP11 state, as they were initialized in LP00 when in 'sleep mode',
which is assumed to be the sensor manual definition for the D-PHY defined
stop mode.

The stream start/stop was performed by enabling disabling clock gating,
and had the side effect to change the lanes sleep mode configuration when
stream was stopped.

Clock gating/ungating:
-       ret = ov5640_mod_reg(sensor, OV5640_REG_MIPI_CTRL00, BIT(5),
-                            on ? 0 : BIT(5));
-       if (ret)

Set lanes in LP11 when in 'sleep mode':
-       ret = ov5640_write_reg(sensor, OV5640_REG_PAD_OUTPUT00,
-                              on ? 0x00 : 0x70);

This commit fixes an issue reported by Jagan Teki on i.MX6 platforms that
prevents the host interface from powering up correctly:

It also improves MIPI capture operations stability on my testing platform
where MIPI capture often failed and returned all-purple frames.
