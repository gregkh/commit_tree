afs: Fix missing net error handling

kAFS can be given certain network errors (EADDRNOTAVAIL, EHOSTDOWN and
ERFKILL) that it doesn't handle in its server/address rotation algorithms.
They cause the probing and rotation to abort immediately rather than
rotating.

Fix this by:

 (1) Abstracting out the error prioritisation from the VL and FS rotation
     algorithms into a common function and expand usage into the server
     probing code.

     When multiple errors are available, this code selects the one we'd
     prefer to return.

 (2) Add handling for EADDRNOTAVAIL, EHOSTDOWN and ERFKILL.
