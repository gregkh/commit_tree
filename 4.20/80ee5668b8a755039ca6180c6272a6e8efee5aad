perf beauty: Add a generator for MAP_ mmap's flag constants

It'll use tools/{arch}/*,include copies of mman.h to generate a table to
be used by tools, initially by the 'mmap' beautifiers in 'perf trace',
but that could also be used to translate from a string constant to the
integer value to be used in a eBPF or tracefs tracepoint filter.

Tested for all archs using:

$ for arch in `ls tools/arch/` ; \
	do echo $arch ; tools/perf/trace/beauty/mmap_flags.sh $arch ; \
   done | less

Example for alpha, an oddball, doesn't include any header, defines all
its stuff:

  $ tools/perf/trace/beauty/mmap_flags.sh alpha
  static const char *mmap_flags[] = {
	[ilog2(0x10) + 1] = "ANONYMOUS",
	[ilog2(0x02000) + 1] = "DENYWRITE",
	[ilog2(0x04000) + 1] = "EXECUTABLE",
	[ilog2(0x100) + 1] = "FIXED",
	[ilog2(0x01000) + 1] = "GROWSDOWN",
	[ilog2(0x100000) + 1] = "HUGETLB",
	[ilog2(0x08000) + 1] = "LOCKED",
	[ilog2(0x40000) + 1] = "NONBLOCK",
	[ilog2(0x10000) + 1] = "NORESERVE",
	[ilog2(0x20000) + 1] = "POPULATE",
	[ilog2(0x02) + 1] = "PRIVATE",
	[ilog2(0x01) + 1] = "SHARED",
	[ilog2(0x80000) + 1] = "STACK",
  };
  $

Common case, my workstation, defines one entry (MAP_32BIT), then
includes mman.h, which gets it to include mman-common.h too:

  $ tools/perf/trace/beauty/mmap_flags.sh
  static const char *mmap_flags[] = {
	[ilog2(0x40) + 1] = "32BIT",
	[ilog2(0x01) + 1] = "SHARED",
	[ilog2(0x02) + 1] = "PRIVATE",
	[ilog2(0x10) + 1] = "FIXED",
	[ilog2(0x20) + 1] = "ANONYMOUS",
	[ilog2(0x100000) + 1] = "FIXED_NOREPLACE",
	[ilog2(0x0100) + 1] = "GROWSDOWN",
	[ilog2(0x0800) + 1] = "DENYWRITE",
	[ilog2(0x1000) + 1] = "EXECUTABLE",
	[ilog2(0x2000) + 1] = "LOCKED",
	[ilog2(0x4000) + 1] = "NORESERVE",
	[ilog2(0x8000) + 1] = "POPULATE",
	[ilog2(0x10000) + 1] = "NONBLOCK",
	[ilog2(0x20000) + 1] = "STACK",
	[ilog2(0x40000) + 1] = "HUGETLB",
	[ilog2(0x80000) + 1] = "SYNC",
  };
  $ uname -m
  x86_64
  $

Sparc, that defines a bunch then includes just mman-common.h:

  $ tools/perf/trace/beauty/mmap_flags.sh sparc
  static const char *mmap_flags[] = {
	[ilog2(0x0800) + 1] = "DENYWRITE",
	[ilog2(0x1000) + 1] = "EXECUTABLE",
	[ilog2(0x0200) + 1] = "GROWSDOWN",
	[ilog2(0x40000) + 1] = "HUGETLB",
	[ilog2(0x100) + 1] = "LOCKED",
	[ilog2(0x10000) + 1] = "NONBLOCK",
	[ilog2(0x40) + 1] = "NORESERVE",
	[ilog2(0x8000) + 1] = "POPULATE",
	[ilog2(0x20000) + 1] = "STACK",
	[ilog2(0x01) + 1] = "SHARED",
	[ilog2(0x02) + 1] = "PRIVATE",
	[ilog2(0x10) + 1] = "FIXED",
	[ilog2(0x20) + 1] = "ANONYMOUS",
	[ilog2(0x100000) + 1] = "FIXED_NOREPLACE",
  };
