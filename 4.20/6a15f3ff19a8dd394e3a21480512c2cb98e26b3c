drm/amdgpu: Initialize fences array entries in amdgpu_sa_bo_next_hole

The entries were only initialized once in amdgpu_sa_bo_new. If a fence
wasn't signalled yet in the first amdgpu_sa_bo_next_hole call, but then
got signalled before a later amdgpu_sa_bo_next_hole call, it could
destroy the fence but leave its pointer in the array, resulting in
use-after-free in amdgpu_sa_bo_new.
