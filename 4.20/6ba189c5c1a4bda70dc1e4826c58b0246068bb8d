ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix the mute LED regresion on Lenovo X1 Carbon

Users reported a mute LED regression on Lenovo X1 Carbon, the root
cause is we applied the fixup of ALC285_FIXUP_LENOVO_HEADPHONE_NOISE
to this machine, then the machine can't apply the fixup of
ALC269_FIXUP_THINKPAD_ACPI anymore. To fix it, we chain two fixup
together.
