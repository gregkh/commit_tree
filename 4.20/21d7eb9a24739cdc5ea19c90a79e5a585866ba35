perf augmented_syscalls: Check probe_read_str() return separately

Using a value returned from probe_read_str() to tell how many bytes to
copy using perf_event_output() has issues in some older kernels, like
4.17.17-100.fc27.x86_64, so separate the bounds checking done on how
many bytes to copy to a separate variable, so that the next patch has
only what is being done to make the test pass on older BPF validators.
