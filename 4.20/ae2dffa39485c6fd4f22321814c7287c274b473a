fuse: introduce fc->bg_lock

To reduce contention of fc->lock, this patch introduces bg_lock for
protection of fields related to background queue. These are:
max_background, congestion_threshold, num_background, active_background,
bg_queue and blocked.

This allows next patch to make async reads not requiring fc->lock, so async
reads and writes will have better performance executed in parallel.
