ARM: 8806/1: kprobes: Fix false positive with FORTIFY_SOURCE

The arm compiler internally interprets an inline assembly label
as an unsigned long value, not a pointer. As a result, under
CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE, the address of a label has a size of 4 bytes,
which was tripping the runtime checks. Instead, we can just cast the label
(as done with the size calculations earlier).
