mmc: sdhci: SDMA may use Auto-CMD23 in v4 mode

When Host Version 4 Enable is set to 1, SDMA uses ADMA System Address
register (05Fh-058h) instead of using register (000h-004h) to indicate
its system address of data location. The register (000h-004h) is
re-assigned to 32-bit Block Count and Auto CMD23 argument, so then SDMA
may use Auto CMD23.
