iwlwifi: mvm: check for n_profiles validity in EWRD ACPI

When reading the profiles from the EWRD table in ACPI, we loop over
the data and set it into our internal table.  We use the number of
profiles specified in ACPI without checking its validity, so if the
ACPI table is corrupted and the number is larger than our array size,
we will try to make an out-of-bounds access.

Fix this by making sure the value specified in the ACPI table is
valid.
