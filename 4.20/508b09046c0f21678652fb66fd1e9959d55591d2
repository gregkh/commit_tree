netfilter: ipv6: Preserve link scope traffic original oif

When ip6_route_me_harder is invoked, it resets outgoing interface of:
  - link-local scoped packets sent by neighbor discovery
  - multicast packets sent by MLD host
  - multicast packets send by MLD proxy daemon that sets outgoing
    interface through IPV6_PKTINFO ipi6_ifindex

Link-local and multicast packets must keep their original oif after
ip6_route_me_harder is called.
