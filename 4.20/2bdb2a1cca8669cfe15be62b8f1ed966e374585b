clk: qcom: Allocate space for NULL terimation in DFS table

The table allocated in clk_rcg2_dfs_populate_freq_table() is
eventually iterated over by qcom_find_freq() which assumes that the
table is NULL terminated.  Allocate one extra space in the array for
the NULL termination.  Initting of the NULL termination is implicit
due to kcalloc().
