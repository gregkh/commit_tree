regulator/gpio: Allow nonexclusive GPIO access

This allows nonexclusive (simultaneous) access to a single
GPIO line for the fixed regulator enable line. This happens
when several regulators use the same GPIO for enabling and
disabling a regulator, and all need a handle on their GPIO
descriptor.

This solution with a special flag is not entirely elegant
and should ideally be replaced by something more careful as
this makes it possible for several consumers to
enable/disable the same GPIO line to the left and right
without any consistency. The current use inside the regulator
core should however be fine as it takes special care to
handle this.

For the state of the GPIO backend, this is still the
lesser evil compared to going back to global GPIO
numbers.
