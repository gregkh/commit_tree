Btrfs: delayed-inode: use rb_first_cached for ins_root and del_root

rb_first_cached() trades an extra pointer "leftmost" for doing the same job as
rb_first() but in O(1).

Functions manipulating delayed_item need to get the first entry, this converts
it to use rb_first_cached().

For more details about the optimization see patch "Btrfs: delayed-refs:
use rb_first_cached for href_root".
