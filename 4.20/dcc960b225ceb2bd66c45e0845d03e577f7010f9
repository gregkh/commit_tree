EDAC, sb_edac: Return early on ADDRV bit and address type test

Users of the mce_register_decode_chain() are called for every logged
error. EDAC drivers should check:

1) Is this a memory error? [bit 7 in status register]
2) Is there a valid address? [bit 58 in status register]
3) Is the address a system address? [bitfield 8:6 in misc register]

The sb_edac driver performed test "1" twice. Waited far too long to
perform check "2". Didn't do check "3" at all.

Fix it by moving the test for valid address from
sbridge_mce_output_error() into sbridge_mce_check_error() and add a test
for the type immediately after. Delete the redundant check for the type
of the error from sbridge_mce_output_error().
