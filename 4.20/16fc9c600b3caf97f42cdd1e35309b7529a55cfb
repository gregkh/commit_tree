rcu: Remove rcu_state_p pointer to default rcu_state structure

The rcu_state_p pointer references the default rcu_state structure,
that is, the one that call_rcu() uses, as opposed to call_rcu_bh()
and sometimes call_rcu_sched().  But there is now only one rcu_state
structure, so that one structure is by definition the default, which
means that the rcu_state_p pointer no longer serves any useful purpose.
This commit therefore removes it.
