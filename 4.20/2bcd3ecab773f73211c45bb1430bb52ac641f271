drm/meson: Fixes for drm_crtc_vblank_on/off support

Since Linux 4.17, calls to drm_crtc_vblank_on/off are mandatory, and we get
a warning when ctrc is disabled :
" driver forgot to call drm_crtc_vblank_off()"

But, the vsync IRQ was not totally disabled due the transient hardware
state and specific interrupt line, thus adding proper IRQ masking from
the HHI system control registers.

The last change fixes a race condition introduced by calling the added
drm_crtc_vblank_on/off when an HPD event occurs from the HDMI connector,
triggering a WARN_ON() in the _atomic_begin() callback when the CRTC
is disabled, thus also triggering a WARN_ON() in drm_vblank_put() :

The issue is that vblank need to be enabled in any occurrence of :
- atomic_enable()
- atomic_begin() and state->enable == true, which was not the case

Moving the CRTC enable code to a common function and calling in one of
these occurrence solves this race condition and makes sure vblank is
enabled in each call to _atomic_begin() from the HPD event leading to
drm_atomic_helper_commit_planes().

To Summarize :
- Make sure that the CRTC code will call the drm_crtc_vblank_on()/off()
- *Really* mask the Vsync IRQ
- Initialize and enable vblank at the first
  atomic_begin()/_atomic_enable()
