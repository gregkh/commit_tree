RDMA/mlx5: Fix fence type for IB_WR_LOCAL_INV WR

Currently, for IB_WR_LOCAL_INV WR, when the next fence is None, the
current fence will be SMALL instead of Normal Fence.

Without this patch krping doesn't work on CX-5 devices and throws
following error:

The error messages are from CX5 driver are: (from server side)

Fixed the logic to set the correct fence type.
