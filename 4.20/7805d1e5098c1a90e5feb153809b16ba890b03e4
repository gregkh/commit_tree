drm/omap: Don't call HDMI mode and infoframe operations recursively

The HDMI mode (.set_hdmi_mode()) and infoframe (.set_infoframe())
operations are called recursively from the display device back to the
HDMI encoder. This isn't required, as all components other than the HDMI
encoder just forward the operation to the previous component in the
chain. Call the operations directly on the HDMI encoder.
