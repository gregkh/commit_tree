net: hns3: Fix for setting speed for phy failed problem

The function of genphy_read_status is that reading phy information
from HW and using these information to update SW variable. If user
is using ethtool to setting the speed of phy and service task is calling
by hclge_get_mac_phy_link, the result of speed setting is uncertain.
Because ethtool cmd will modified phydev and hclge_get_mac_phy_link also
will modified phydev.

Because phy state machine will update phy link periodically, we can
just use phydev->link to check the link status. This patch removes
function call of genphy_read_status. To ensure accuracy, this patch
adds a phy state check. If phy state is not PHY_RUNNING, we consider
link is down. Because in some scenarios, phydev->link may be link up,
but phy state is not PHY_RUNNING. This is just an intermediate state.
In fact, the link is not ready yet.
