RISC-V: Mask out the F extension on systems without D

The RISC-V Linux port doesn't support systems that have the F extension
but don't have the D extension -- we actually don't support systems
without D either, but Alan's patch set is rectifying that soon.  For now
I think we can leave this in a semi-broken state and just wait for
Alan's patch set to get merged for proper non-FPU support -- the patch
set is starting to look good, so doing something in-between doesn't seem
like it's worth the work.

I don't think it's worth fretting about support for systems with F but
not D for now: our glibc ABIs are IMAC and IMAFDC so they probably won't
end up being popular.  We can always extend this in the future.
