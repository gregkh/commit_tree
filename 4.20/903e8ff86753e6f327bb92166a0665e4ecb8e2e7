kernel/kcov.c: mark funcs in __sanitizer_cov_trace_pc() as notrace

Since __sanitizer_cov_trace_pc() is marked as notrace, function calls in
__sanitizer_cov_trace_pc() shouldn't be traced either.
ftrace_graph_caller() gets called for each function that isn't marked
'notrace', like canonicalize_ip().  This is the call trace from a run:

[  139.644550]  ftrace_graph_caller+0x1c/0x24
[  139.648352]  canonicalize_ip+0x18/0x28
[  139.652313]  __sanitizer_cov_trace_pc+0x14/0x58
[  139.656184]  sched_clock+0x34/0x1e8
[  139.659759]  trace_clock_local+0x40/0x88
[  139.663722]  ftrace_push_return_trace+0x8c/0x1f0
[  139.667767]  prepare_ftrace_return+0xa8/0x100
[  139.671709]  ftrace_graph_caller+0x1c/0x24

Rework so that check_kcov_mode() and canonicalize_ip() that are called
from __sanitizer_cov_trace_pc() are also marked as notrace.
