KVM: nVMX: use vm_exit_controls_init() to write exit controls for vmcs02

Write VM_EXIT_CONTROLS using vm_exit_controls_init() when configuring
vmcs02, otherwise vm_exit_controls_shadow will be stale.  EFER in
particular can be corrupted if VM_EXIT_LOAD_IA32_EFER is not updated
due to an incorrect shadow optimization, which can crash L0 due to
EFER not being loaded on exit.  This does not occur with the current
code base simply because update_transition_efer() unconditionally
clears VM_EXIT_LOAD_IA32_EFER before conditionally setting it, and
because a nested guest always starts with VM_EXIT_LOAD_IA32_EFER
clear, i.e. we'll only ever unnecessarily clear the bit.  That is,
until someone optimizes update_transition_efer()...
