Revert "powerpc/8xx: Use L1 entry APG to handle _PAGE_ACCESSED for CONFIG_SWAP"

This reverts commit 4f94b2c7462d9720b2afa7e8e8d4c19446bb31ce.

That commit was buggy, as it used rlwinm instead of rlwimi.
Instead of fixing that bug, we revert the previous commit in order to
reduce the dependency between L1 entries and L2 entries
