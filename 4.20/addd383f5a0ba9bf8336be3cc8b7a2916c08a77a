net: Update netconf dump handlers for strict data checking

Update inet_netconf_dump_devconf, inet6_netconf_dump_devconf, and
mpls_netconf_dump_devconf for strict data checking. If the flag is set,
the dump request is expected to have an netconfmsg struct as the header.
The struct only has the family member and no attributes can be appended.
