RDMA/rdmavt: Fix rvt_create_ah function signature

rdmavt uses a crazy system that looses the type checking when assinging
functions to struct ib_device function pointers. Because of this the
signature to this function was not changed when the below commit revised
things.

Fix the signature so we are not calling a function pointer with a
mismatched signature.
