net: hns3: Fix for rx vlan id handle to support Rev 0x21 hardware

In revision 0x20, we use vlan id != 0 to check whether a vlan tag
has been offloaded, so vlan id 0 is not supported.

In revision 0x21, rx buffer descriptor adds two bits to indicate
whether one or more vlan tags have been offloaded, so vlan id 0
is valid now.

This patch seperates the handle for vlan id 0, add vlan id 0 support
for revision 0x21.
