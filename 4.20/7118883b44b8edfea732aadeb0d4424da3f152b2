fuse: use mtime for readdir cache verification

Store the modification time of the directory in the cache, obtained before
starting to fill the cache.

When reading the cache, verify that the directory hasn't changed, by
checking if current modification time is the same as the one stored in the
cache.

This only needs to be done when the current file position is at the
beginning of the directory, as mandated by POSIX.
