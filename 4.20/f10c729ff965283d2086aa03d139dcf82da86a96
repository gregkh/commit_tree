kvm: vmx: Defer setting of DR6 until #DB delivery

When exception payloads are enabled by userspace (which is not yet
possible) and a #DB is raised in L2, defer the setting of DR6 until
later. Under VMX, this allows the L1 hypervisor to intercept the fault
before DR6 is modified. Under SVM, DR6 is modified before L1 can
intercept the fault (as has always been the case with DR7).

Note that the payload associated with a #DB exception includes only
the "new DR6 bits." When the payload is delievered, DR6.B0-B3 will be
cleared and DR6.RTM will be set prior to merging in the new DR6 bits.

Also note that bit 16 in the "new DR6 bits" is set to indicate that a
debug exception (#DB) or a breakpoint exception (#BP) occurred inside
an RTM region while advanced debugging of RTM transactional regions
was enabled. Though the reverse of DR6.RTM, this makes the #DB payload
field compatible with both the pending debug exceptions field under
VMX and the exit qualification for #DB exceptions under VMX.
