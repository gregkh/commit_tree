i40e: clean zero-copy XDP Rx ring on shutdown/reset

Outstanding Rx descriptors are temporarily stored on a stash/reuse
queue. When/if the HW rings comes up again, entries from the stash are
used to re-populate the ring.

The latter required some restructuring of the allocation scheme for
the AF_XDP zero-copy implementation. There is now a fast, and a slow
allocation. The "fast allocation" is used from the fast-path and
obtains free buffers from the fill ring and the internal recycle
mechanism. The "slow allocation" is only used in ring setup, and
obtains buffers from the fill ring and the stash (if any).
