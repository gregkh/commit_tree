powerpc/eeh: Cleanup eeh_ops.wait_state()

The wait_state member of eeh_ops does not need to be platform
dependent; it's just logic around eeh_ops.get_state(). Therefore,
merge the two (slightly different!) platform versions into a new
function, eeh_wait_state() and remove the eeh_ops member.

While doing this, also correct:
* The wait logic, so that it never waits longer than max_wait.
* The wait logic, so that it never waits less than
  EEH_STATE_MIN_WAIT_TIME.
* One call site where the result is treated like a bit field before
  it's checked for negative error values.
* In pseries_eeh_get_state(), rename the "state" parameter to "delay"
  because that's what it is.
