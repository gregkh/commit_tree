IB/hfi1: Fix a latency issue for small messages

A recent performance enhancement introduced a latency issue in the
HFI message path.  The new algorithm removed a forced call send for
PIO messages and added a forced schedule event for messages larger
than the MTU.

For PIO, the schedule path can introduce thrashing that can
significantly impact the throughput for small messages.

If a message size is within the PIO threshold, always take the send
path.
