serial: sh-sci: do not warn if DMA transfers are not supported

Not all (H)SCIF devices support DMA, and failure to set it up is not
normally a cause for concern. This patch demotes the associated warning to
debug output.

Inspired by BSP patch "sci: sh-sci: Fix transfer sequence of unsupport DMA
transfer" (6beb1f98d3bd30) by Hiromitsu Yamasaki.
