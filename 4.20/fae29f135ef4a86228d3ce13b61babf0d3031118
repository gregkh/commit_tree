hwrng: core - document the quality field

quality field is currently documented as being 'per mill'.  In fact the
math involved is:

                add_hwgenerator_randomness((void *)rng_fillbuf, rc,
                                           rc * current_quality * 8 >> 10);

thus the actual definition is "bits of entropy per 1024 bits of input".

The current documentation seems to have confused multiple people
in the past, let's fix the documentation to match code.

An alternative is to change core to match driver expectations, replacing
	rc * current_quality * 8 >> 10
with
	rc * current_quality / 1000
but that has performance costs, so probably isn't a good option.
