IB/mlx5: Add support for extended atomic operations

Extended atomic operations cmp&swp and fetch&add is a Mellanox
feature extending the standard atomic operation to use, varied
operand sizes, as apposed to normal atomic operation that use
an 8 byte operand only.
Extended atomics allows masking the results and arguments.

This patch configures QP to support extended atomic operation
with the maximum size possible, as exposed by HCA capabilities.
