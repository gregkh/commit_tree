macintosh: Use common code to access RTC

Now that the 68k Mac port has adopted the via-pmu driver, the same RTC
code can be shared between m68k and powerpc. Replace duplicated code in
arch/powerpc and arch/m68k with common RTC accessors for Cuda and PMU.

Drop the problematic WARN_ON which was introduced in commit 22db552b50fa
("powerpc/powermac: Fix rtc read/write functions").
