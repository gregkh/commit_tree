IB/core: Fix oops in netdev_next_upper_dev_rcu()

When support for bonding of RoCE devices was added, there was
necessarily a link between the RoCE device and the paired netdevice that
was part of the bond.  If you remove the mlx4_en module, that paired
association is broken (the RoCE device is still present but the paired
netdevice has been released).  We need to account for this in
is_upper_ndev_bond_master_filter() and filter out those links with a
broken pairing or else we later oops in netdev_next_upper_dev_rcu().
