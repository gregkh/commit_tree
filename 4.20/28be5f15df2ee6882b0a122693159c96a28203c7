regulator: fixed: Default enable high on DT regulators

commit efdfeb079cc3
("regulator: fixed: Convert to use GPIO descriptor only")
switched to use gpiod_get() to look up the regulator from the
gpiolib core whether that is device tree or boardfile.

This meant that we activate the code in
a603a2b8d86e ("gpio: of: Add special quirk to parse regulator flags")
which means the descriptors coming from the device tree already
have the right inversion and open drain semantics set up from
the gpiolib core.

As the fixed regulator was inspected again we got the
inverted inversion and things broke.

Fix it by ignoring the config in the device tree for now: the
later patches in the series will push all inversion handling
over to the gpiolib core and set it up properly in the
boardfiles for legacy devices, but I did not finish that
for this kernel cycle.
