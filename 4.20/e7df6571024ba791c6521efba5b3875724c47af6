drm/omap: panel-tpo-td043mtea1: Convert to the GPIO descriptors API

The GPIO descriptor API is favoured over the plain GPIO API for consumer
drivers. Using it simplifies the driver code.

As the descriptor API handles the active-low flag internally we need to
invert the polarity of all GPIO operations in the driver. Rename the
nreset_gpio field to reset_gpio to reflect that.

The reset GPIO is mandatory, so drop conditional tests through the
driver.
