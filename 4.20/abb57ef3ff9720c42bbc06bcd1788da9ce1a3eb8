Btrfs: skip set_page_dirty if eb pages are already dirty

As long as @eb is marked with EXTENT_BUFFER_DIRTY, all of its pages
are dirty, so no need to set pages dirty again.

Ftrace showed that the loop took 10us on my dev box, so removing this
can save us at least 10us if eb is already dirty and otherwise avoid a
potentially expensive calls to set_page_dirty.
