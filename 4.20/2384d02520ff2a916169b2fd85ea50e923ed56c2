net/ipv6: Add anycast addresses to a global hashtable

icmp6_send() function is expensive on systems with a large number of
interfaces. Every time itâ€™s called, it has to verify that the source
address does not correspond to an existing anycast address by looping
through every device and every anycast address on the device.  This can
result in significant delays for a CPU when there are a large number of
neighbors and ND timers are frequently timing out and calling
neigh_invalidate().

Add anycast addresses to a global hashtable to allow quick searching for
matching anycast addresses.  This is based on inet6_addr_lst in addrconf.c.
