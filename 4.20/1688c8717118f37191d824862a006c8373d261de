pwm: lpss: Add ACPI HID for second PWM controller on Cherry Trail devices

The second PWM controller on Cherry Trail devices uses a separate ACPI
HID: "80862289", add this so that the driver will properly bind to the
second PWM controller.

The second PWM controller is usually not used, the main thing gained by
this is properly putting the PWM controller in D3 on suspend.
