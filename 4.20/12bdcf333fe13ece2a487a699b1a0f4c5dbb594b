afs: Set up the iov_iter before calling afs_extract_data()

afs_extract_data sets up a temporary iov_iter and passes it to AF_RXRPC
each time it is called to describe the remaining buffer to be filled.

Instead:

 (1) Put an iterator in the afs_call struct.

 (2) Set the iterator for each marshalling stage to load data into the
     appropriate places.  A number of convenience functions are provided to
     this end (eg. afs_extract_to_buf()).

     This iterator is then passed to afs_extract_data().

 (3) Use the new ITER_DISCARD iterator to discard any excess data provided
     by FetchData.
