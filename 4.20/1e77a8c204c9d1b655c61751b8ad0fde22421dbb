smb3: do not attempt cifs operation in smb3 query info error path

If backupuid mount option is sent, we can incorrectly retry
(on access denied on query info) with a cifs (FindFirst) operation
on an smb3 mount which causes the server to force the session close.

We set backup intent on open so no need for this fallback.
