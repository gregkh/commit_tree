irqchip/pdc: Setup all edge interrupts as rising edge at GIC

The PDC irqchp can convert a falling edge or level low interrupt to a
rising edge or level high interrupt at the GIC. We just need to setup
the GIC correctly. Set up the interrupt type for the IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH
as IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING at the GIC.
