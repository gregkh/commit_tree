virtio_net: ethtool tx napi configuration

Implement ethtool .set_coalesce (-C) and .get_coalesce (-c) handlers.
Interrupt moderation is currently not supported, so these accept and
display the default settings of 0 usec and 1 frame.

Toggle tx napi through setting tx-frames. So as to not interfere
with possible future interrupt moderation, value 1 means tx napi while
value 0 means not.

Only allow the switching when device is down for simplicity.
