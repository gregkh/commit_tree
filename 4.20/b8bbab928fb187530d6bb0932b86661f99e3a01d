KVM: nVMX: implement enlightened VMPTRLD and VMCLEAR

Per Hyper-V TLFS 5.0b:

"The L1 hypervisor may choose to use enlightened VMCSs by writing 1 to
the corresponding field in the VP assist page (see section 7.8.7).
Another field in the VP assist page controls the currently active
enlightened VMCS. Each enlightened VMCS is exactly one page (4 KB) in
size and must be initially zeroed. No VMPTRLD instruction must be
executed to make an enlightened VMCS active or current.

After the L1 hypervisor performs a VM entry with an enlightened VMCS,
the VMCS is considered active on the processor. An enlightened VMCS
can only be active on a single processor at the same time. The L1
hypervisor can execute a VMCLEAR instruction to transition an
enlightened VMCS from the active to the non-active state. Any VMREAD
or VMWRITE instructions while an enlightened VMCS is active is
unsupported and can result in unexpected behavior."

Keep Enlightened VMCS structure for the current L2 guest permanently mapped
from struct nested_vmx instead of mapping it every time.
