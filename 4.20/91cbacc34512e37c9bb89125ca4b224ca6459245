tools/testing/selftests/vm/map_fixed_noreplace.c: add test for MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE

Add a test for MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE, based on some code originally by Jann
Horn.  This would have caught the overlap bug reported by Daniel Micay.

I originally suggested to Michal that we create MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE, but
instead of writing a selftest I spent my time bike-shedding whether it
should be called MAP_FIXED_SAFE/NOCLOBBER/WEAK/NEW ..  mea culpa.
