drm/msm/dpu: remove RM dependency on connector state

Connector states were passed around RM to update the custom
topology connector property with chosen topology data. Now that
we got rid of both custom properties and topology names, this
change cleans up the mechanism to pass connector states across
RM helpers and encoder functions.

changes in v5:
	- Introduced in the series
changes in v6:
	- remove parameter checking in rm reserve (Jordan)
