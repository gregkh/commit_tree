drm/amd/display: Remove redundant i2c structs

[Why]
The i2c code contains two structs that contain the same
information as i2c_payload

[How]
Replace references to those structs with references to
i2c_payload

dce_i2c_transaction_request->status was written to but never read,
so all references to it are removed
