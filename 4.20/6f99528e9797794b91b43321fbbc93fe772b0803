net: core: netlink: add helper refcount dec and lock function

Rtnl lock is encapsulated in netlink and cannot be accessed by other
modules directly. This means that reference counted objects that rely on
rtnl lock cannot use it with refcounter helper function that atomically
releases decrements reference and obtains mutex.

This patch implements simple wrapper function around refcount_dec_and_lock
that obtains rtnl lock if reference counter value reached 0.
