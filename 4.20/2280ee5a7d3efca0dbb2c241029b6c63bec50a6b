rcu: Remove rcu_data_p pointer to default rcu_data structure

The rcu_data_p pointer references the default set of per-CPU rcu_data
structures, that is, those that call_rcu() uses, as opposed to
call_rcu_bh() and sometimes call_rcu_sched().  But there is now only one
set of per-CPU rcu_data structures, so that one set is by definition
the default, which means that the rcu_data_p pointer no longer serves
any useful purpose.  This commit therefore removes it.
