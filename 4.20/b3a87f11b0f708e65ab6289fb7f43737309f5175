iwlwifi: mvm: make queue TID change more explicit

Instead of iterating all the queues after having potentially
changed some queue configurations, rechecking if that was done,
mark the ones that do need a TID change explicitly in a bitmap
and use that to send the change to the firmware.

While at it, also rename iwl_mvm_change_queue_owner() to
iwl_mvm_change_queue_tid() since that's more obvious - the
"kind" of owner isn't immediately clear right now.
