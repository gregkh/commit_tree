staging: rtl8188eu: Simplify memcmp logical checks

Clang generates a warning when it sees a logical not followed by a
conditional operator like ==, >, or < because it thinks that the logical
not should be applied to the whole statement:

drivers/staging/rtl8188eu/core/rtw_ieee80211.c:293:8: warning: logical
not is only applied to the left hand side of this comparison
[-Wlogical-not-parentheses]

It assumes the author might have made a mistake in their logic:

if (!a == b) -> if (!(a == b))

Sometimes that is the case; other times, it's just a super convoluted
way of saying 'if (a)' when b = 0:

if (!1 == 0) -> if (0 == 0) -> if (true)

Alternatively:

if (!1 == 0) -> if (!!1) -> if (1)

Simplify these comparisons so that Clang doesn't complain.
