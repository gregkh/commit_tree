ataflop: fix error handling during setup

Move queue allocation next to disk allocation to fix a couple of issues:

- If add_disk() hasn't been called, we should clear disk->queue before
  calling put_disk().
- If we fail to allocate a request queue, we still need to put all of
  the disks, not just the ones that we allocated queues for.
