usb: core: added uevent for over-current

After commit 1cbd53c8cd85 ("usb: core: introduce per-port over-current
counters") usb ports expose a sysfs value 'over_current_count'
to user space. This value on its own is not very useful as it requires
manual polling.

As a solution, fire a udev event from the usb hub device that specifies
the values 'OVER_CURRENT_PORT' and 'OVER_CURRENT_COUNT' that indicate
the path of the usb port where the over-current event occurred and the
value of 'over_current_count' in sysfs. Additionally, call
sysfs_notify() so the sysfs value supports poll().
