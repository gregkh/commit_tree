tracing: Fix memory leak of instance function hash filters

The following commands will cause a memory leak:

 # cd /sys/kernel/tracing
 # mkdir instances/foo
 # echo schedule > instance/foo/set_ftrace_filter
 # rmdir instances/foo

The reason is that the hashes that hold the filters to set_ftrace_filter and
set_ftrace_notrace are not freed if they contain any data on the instance
and the instance is removed.
