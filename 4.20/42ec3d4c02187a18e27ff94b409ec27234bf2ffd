vfs: make remap_file_range functions take and return bytes completed

Change the remap_file_range functions to take a number of bytes to
operate upon and return the number of bytes they operated on.  This is a
requirement for allowing fs implementations to return short clone/dedupe
results to the user, which will enable us to obey resource limits in a
graceful manner.

A subsequent patch will enable copy_file_range to signal to the
->clone_file_range implementation that it can handle a short length,
which will be returned in the function's return value.  For now the
short return is not implemented anywhere so the behavior won't change --
either copy_file_range manages to clone the entire range or it tries an
alternative.

Neither clone ioctl can take advantage of this, alas.
