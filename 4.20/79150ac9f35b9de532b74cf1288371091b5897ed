media: ddbridge: header/boilerplate cleanups and cosmetics

Cleanup blank lines, remove wrong links to
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html (the driver is licensed under the
terms of GPLv2, but the link points to a copy of the GPLv3), and fix
the filename reference in ddbridge-i2c.h.

[mchehab@kernel.org: removed whitespace changes at the licensing text,
 as we didn't get any acks from the authors with regards to changing
 the text]
