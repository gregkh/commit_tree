staging:rtl8192u: Refactor phy_RF8256_Config_ParaFile() - Style

Rename the function phy_RF8256_Config_ParaFile() to
phy_rf8256_config_para_file(). This change clears the checkpatch issue
with CamelCase naming.

Additionally as the function is only ever used in one file,
(r8190_rtl8256.c), the function prototype has been removed from the
header file, (r8190_rtl8256.h).

These changes are purely coding style in nature and should have no
impact on runtime code execution.
