amdgpu: fix multi-process hang issue

SWDEV-146499: hang during multi vulkan process testing

cause:
the second frame's PREAMBLE_IB have clear-state
and LOAD actions, those actions ruin the pipeline
that is still doing process in the previous frame's
work-load IB.

fix:
need insert pipeline sync if have context switch for
SRIOV (because only SRIOV will report PREEMPTION flag
to UMD)
