net: don't keep lonely packets forever in the gro hash

Eric noted that with UDP GRO and NAPI timeout, we could keep a single
UDP packet inside the GRO hash forever, if the related NAPI instance
calls napi_gro_complete() at an higher frequency than the NAPI timeout.
Willem noted that even TCP packets could be trapped there, till the
next retransmission.
This patch tries to address the issue, flushing the old packets -
those with a NAPI_GRO_CB age before the current jiffy - before scheduling
the NAPI timeout. The rationale is that such a timeout should be
well below a jiffy and we are not flushing packets eligible for sane GRO.

v1  -> v2:
 - clarified the commit message and comment

RFC -> v1:
 - added 'Fixes tags', cleaned-up the wording.
