perf tools: Improve thread_stack__process() for trace begin / end

thread_stack__process() is used to create call paths for database
export.  Improve the handling of trace begin / end to allow for a trace
that ends in a call.

Previously, the Intel PT decoder would indicate begin / end by a branch
from / to zero. That hides useful information, in particular when a
trace ends with a call. Before remedying that, enhance the thread stack
so that it identifies the trace end by the flag instead of by ip == 0.
