um: Make line/tty semantics use true write IRQ

This fixes a long standing bug where large amounts of output
could freeze the tty (most commonly seen on stdio console).
While the bug has always been there it became more pronounced
after moving to the new interrupt controller.

The line semantics are now changed to have true IRQ write
semantics which should further improve the tty/line subsystem
stability and performance
