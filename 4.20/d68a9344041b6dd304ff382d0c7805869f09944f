lightnvm: introduce nvm_rq_to_ppa_list

There is a number of places in the lightnvm subsystem where the user
iterates over the ppa list. Before iterating, the user must know if it
is a single or multiple LBAs due to vector commands using either the
nvm_rq ->ppa_addr or ->ppa_list fields on command submission, which
leads to open-coding the if/else statement.

Instead of having multiple if/else's, move it into a function that can
be called by its users.

A nice side effect of this cleanup is that this patch fixes up a
bunch of cases where we don't consider the single-ppa case in pblk.
