SUNRPC: call_connect_status() must handle tasks that got transmitted

If a task failed to get the write lock in the call to xprt_connect(), then
it will be queued on xprt->sending. In that case, it is possible for it
to get transmitted before the call to call_connect_status(), in which
case it needs to be handled by call_transmit_status() instead.
