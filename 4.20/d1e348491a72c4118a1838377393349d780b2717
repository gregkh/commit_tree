usb storage: group dependent USB storage Kconfig entries together

Instead of explicit setting of USB_STORAGE dependency for every
underlying build entries, exploit if USB_STORAGE / endif block.

The change is a trivial non-functional cleanup, it shortens
the Kconfig file and it is expected to reduce zconf parser
workload a little.

Dependencies of USB_UAS build option are left aside deliberately.
