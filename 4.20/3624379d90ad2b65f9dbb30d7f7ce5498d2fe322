ARC: IOC: panic if kernel was started with previously enabled IOC

If IOC was already enabled (due to bootloader) it technically needs to
be reconfigured with aperture base,size corresponding to Linux memory map
which will certainly be different than uboot's. But disabling and
reenabling IOC when DMA might be potentially active is tricky business.
To avoid random memory issues later, just panic here and ask user to
upgrade bootloader to one which doesn't enable IOC

This was actually seen as issue on some of the HSDK board with a version
of uboot which enabled IOC. There were random issues later with starting
of X or peripherals etc.

Also while I'm at it, replace hardcoded bits in ARC_REG_IO_COH_PARTIAL
and ARC_REG_IO_COH_ENABLE registers by definitions.
