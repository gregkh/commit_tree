net: phy: mdio-gpio: Fix working over slow can_sleep GPIOs

Up until commit 7e5fbd1e0700 ("net: mdio-gpio: Convert to use gpiod
functions where possible"), the _cansleep variants of the gpio_ API was
used. After that commit and the change to gpiod_ API, the _cansleep()
was dropped. This then results in WARN_ON() when used with GPIO
devices which do sleep. Add back the _cansleep() to avoid this.
