net: drop skb on failure in ip_check_defrag()

Most callers of pskb_trim_rcsum() simply drop the skb when
it fails, however, ip_check_defrag() still continues to pass
the skb up to stack. This is suspicious.

In ip_check_defrag(), after we learn the skb is an IP fragment,
passing the skb to callers makes no sense, because callers expect
fragments are defrag'ed on success. So, dropping the skb when we
can't defrag it is reasonable.

Note, prior to commit 88078d98d1bb, this is not a big problem as
checksum will be fixed up anyway. After it, the checksum is not
correct on failure.

Found this during code review.

Fixes: 88078d98d1bb ("net: pskb_trim_rcsum() and CHECKSUM_COMPLETE are friends")
