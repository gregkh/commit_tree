ARM: 8802/1: Call syscall_trace_exit even when system call skipped

On at least x86 and ARM64, and as documented in the ptrace man page
a skipped system call will still cause a syscall exit ptrace stop.

Previous to this commit 32-bit ARM did not, resulting in strace
being confused when seccomp skips system calls.

This change also impacts programs that use ptrace to skip system calls.
