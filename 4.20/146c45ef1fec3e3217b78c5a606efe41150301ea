media: ov9650: avoid maybe-uninitialized warnings

The regmap change causes multiple warnings like

drivers/media/i2c/ov9650.c: In function 'ov965x_g_volatile_ctrl':
drivers/media/i2c/ov9650.c:889:29: error: 'reg2' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
   exposure = ((reg2 & 0x3f) << 10) | (reg1 << 2) |
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~

It is apparently hard for the compiler to see here if ov965x_read()
returned successfully or not. Besides, we have a v4l2_dbg() statement
that prints an uninitialized value if regmap_read() fails.

Adding an 'else' clause avoids the ambiguity.
