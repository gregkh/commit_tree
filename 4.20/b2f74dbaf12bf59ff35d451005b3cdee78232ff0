net: hns3: bugfix for the initialization of command queue's spin lock

The spin lock of the command queue only need to be initialized once
when the driver initializes the command queue. It is not necessary to
initialize the spin lock when resetting. At the same time, the
modification of the queue member should be performed after acquiring
the lock.
