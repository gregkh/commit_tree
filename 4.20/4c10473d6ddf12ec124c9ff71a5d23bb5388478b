ASoC: Intel: Power down links before turning off display audio power

On certain platforms, Display HDMI HDA codec was not going to sleep state
after the use when links are powered down after turning off the display
power. As per the HW recommendation, links are powered down before turning
off the display power to ensure that the codec goes to sleep state.

This patch was updated from an earlier version submitted upstream [1]
which conflicted with the changes merged for HDaudio codec support
with the Intel DSP.
