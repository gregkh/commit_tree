bridge: switchdev: Allow clearing FDB entry offload indication

Currently, an FDB entry only ceases being offloaded when it is deleted.
This changes with VxLAN encapsulation.

Devices capable of performing VxLAN encapsulation usually have only one
FDB table, unlike the software data path which has two - one in the
bridge driver and another in the VxLAN driver.

Therefore, bridge FDB entries pointing to a VxLAN device are only
offloaded if there is a corresponding entry in the VxLAN FDB.

Allow clearing the offload indication in case the corresponding entry
was deleted from the VxLAN FDB.
