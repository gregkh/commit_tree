unifdef: use memcpy instead of strncpy

New versions of gcc reasonably warn about the odd pattern of

	strncpy(p, q, strlen(q));

which really doesn't make sense: the strncpy() ends up being just a slow
and odd way to write memcpy() in this case.

There was a comment about _why_ the code used strncpy - to avoid the
terminating NUL byte, but memcpy does the same and avoids the warning.
