kvm: selftests: introduce ucall

Rework the guest exit to userspace code to generalize the concept
into what it is, a "hypercall to userspace", and provide two
implementations of it: the PortIO version currently used, but only
useable by x86, and an MMIO version that other architectures (except
s390) can use.
