ARM: shmobile: Remove the ARCH_SHMOBILE Kconfig symbol

All drivers for Renesas ARM SoCs have gained proper ARCH_RENESAS
platform dependencies.  Hence finish the conversion from ARCH_SHMOBILE
to ARCH_RENESAS for Renesas 32-bit ARM SoCs, as started by commit
9b5ba0df4ea4f940 ("ARM: shmobile: Introduce ARCH_RENESAS").
