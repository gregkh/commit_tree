reset: Fix potential use-after-free in __of_reset_control_get()

Calling of_node_put() decreases the reference count of a device tree
object, and may free some data.

However, the of_phandle_args structure embedding it is passed to
reset_controller_dev.of_xlate() after that, so it may still be accessed.

Move the call to of_node_put() down to fix this.
