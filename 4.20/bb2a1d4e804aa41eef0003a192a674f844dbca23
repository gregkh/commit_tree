nvme-core: rework a NQN copying operation

Although it is easy to see that the code in nvme_init_subnqn() guarantees that
the subsys->nqn string is '\0'-terminated, apparently Coverity is not smart
enough to see this. Make it easier for Coverity to analyze this code by changing
the strncpy() call into a strlcpy() call. This patch does not change the
behavior of the code but fixes Coveritiy ID 1423720.
