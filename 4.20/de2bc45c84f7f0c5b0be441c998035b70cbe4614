media: vsp1: Update LIF buffer thresholds

The LIF module has a data buffer to accommodate clock rate differences
between the DU and the VSP. Several programmable threshold values
control DU start of frame notification by the VSP and VSP clock
stop/resume. The R-Car Gen2 and Gen3 datasheets recommend values for the
different SoCs. Update the driver to use the recommended values for
optimal operation.

Based on a BSP patch from Koji Matsuoka <koji.matsuoka.xm@renesas.com>,
with Gen2 and V3H/V3M updates.
