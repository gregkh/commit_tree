pinctrl: sh-pfc: rcar: Rename automotive-only arrays to automotive

Renesas RZ/G SoCs are pin compatible with R-Car SoCs, but lack several
automotive-specific peripherals.

Currently pin groups and functions for automotive-specific peripherals
are grouped in arrays named after the automative SoC part numbers.
Rename them to "automotive" for clarity and consistency.
