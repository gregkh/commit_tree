media: ov5670, ov13858: Use pm_runtime_idle

Replace the calls to pm_runtime_get_noresume() and pm_runtime_put() with
pm_runtime_idle() in the driver's probe function. This will have the same
effect with fewer calls. pm_runtime_disable() in remove is sufficient as
the device is already in RPM_SUSPENDED state.
