nfp: bpf: account for BPF-to-BPF calls when preparing nfp JIT

Similarly to "exit" or "helper call" instructions, BPF-to-BPF calls will
require additional processing before translation starts, in order to
record and mark jump destinations.

We also mark the instructions where each subprogram begins. This will be
used in a following commit to determine where to add prologues for
subprograms.
