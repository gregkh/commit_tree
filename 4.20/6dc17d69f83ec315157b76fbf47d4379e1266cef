drm/i915/selftests: Exercise resetting in the middle of a wait-on-fence

On older HW, gen2/3, fence registers are used for detiling GPU commands
and as such changing those registers requires serialisation with the
requests on the GPU. Anything running on the GPU is subject to a hang,
and so we must be able to recover cleanly in the middle of a stuck wait
on a fence register.

We can simulate using the fence on the GPU simply by marking the fence
as active on the request for this vma, the interface being common to all
gen, thus broadening the test.
