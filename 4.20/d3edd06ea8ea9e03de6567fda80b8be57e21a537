tcp: provide earliest departure time in skb->tstamp

Switch internal TCP skb->skb_mstamp to skb->skb_mstamp_ns,
from usec units to nsec units.

Do not clear skb->tstamp before entering IP stacks in TX,
so that qdisc or devices can implement pacing based on the
earliest departure time instead of socket sk->sk_pacing_rate

Packets are fed with tcp_wstamp_ns, and following patch
will update tcp_wstamp_ns when both TCP and sch_fq switch to
the earliest departure time mechanism.
