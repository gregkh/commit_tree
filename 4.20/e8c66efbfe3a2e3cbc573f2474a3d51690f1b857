drm/vmwgfx: Make user resource lookups reference-free during validation

Make the process of looking up a user resource and adding it to the
validation list reference-free unless when it's actually added to the
validation list where a single reference is taken.
This saves two locked atomic operations per command stream buffer object
handle lookup, unless there is a lookup cache hit.
