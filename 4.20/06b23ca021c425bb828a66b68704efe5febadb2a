mmc: sdhci-of-arasan: Add a single data structure to incorporate pdata and soc_ctl_map

Currently, the driver passes platform data as a global structure
and uses the .data of of_device_id to pass the soc_ctl_map. To
make the implementation more flexible add a single data structure
that incorporates both of the above and pass it in the .data of
of_device_id.
