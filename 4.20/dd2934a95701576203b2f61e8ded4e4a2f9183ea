netfilter: conntrack: remove l3->l4 mapping information

l4 protocols are demuxed by l3num, l4num pair.

However, almost all l4 trackers are l3 agnostic.

Only exceptions are:
 - gre, icmp (ipv4 only)
 - icmpv6 (ipv6 only)

This commit gets rid of the l3 mapping, l4 trackers can now be looked up
by their IPPROTO_XXX value alone, which gets rid of the additional l3
indirection.

For icmp, ipcmp6 and gre, add a check on state->pf and
return -NF_ACCEPT in case we're asked to track e.g. icmpv6-in-ipv4,
this seems more fitting than using the generic tracker.

Additionally we can kill the 2nd l4proto definitions that were needed
for v4/v6 split -- they are now the same so we can use single l4proto
struct for each protocol, rather than two.

The EXPORT_SYMBOLs can be removed as all these object files are
part of nf_conntrack with no external references.
