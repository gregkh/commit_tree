MIPS: VDSO: Reduce VDSO_RANDOMIZE_SIZE to 64MB for 64bit

Commit ea7e0480a4b6 ("MIPS: VDSO: Always map near top of user memory")
set VDSO_RANDOMIZE_SIZE to 256MB for 64bit kernel. But take a look at
arch/mips/mm/mmap.c we can see that MIN_GAP is 128MB, which means the
mmap_base may be at (user_address_top - 128MB). This make the stack be
surrounded by mmaped areas, then stack expanding fails and causes a
segmentation fault. Therefore, VDSO_RANDOMIZE_SIZE should be less than
MIN_GAP and this patch reduce it to 64MB.
