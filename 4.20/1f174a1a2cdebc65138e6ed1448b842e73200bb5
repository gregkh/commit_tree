clocksource/drivers/dw_apb: Add reset control

Add code to retrieve the reset property from the dw-apb timers and if
the property is available, the safe operation is to assert the timer
into reset, and followed by a deassert of the timer reset (brings the
timer out of reset).

This patch is needed for systems where the bootloader has left the timer
not used in reset.

 - Trivial conflict with commit a74bd1ad7a:
    "Convert to using %pOFn instead of device_node.name"
