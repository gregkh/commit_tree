crypto: caam/qi2 - add DPAA2-CAAM driver

Add CAAM driver that works using the DPSECI backend, i.e. manages
DPSECI DPAA2 objects sitting on the Management Complex (MC) fsl-mc bus.

Data transfers (crypto requests) are sent/received to/from CAAM crypto
engine via Queue Interface (v2), this being similar to existing caam/qi.
OTOH, configuration/setup (obtaining virtual queue IDs, authorization
etc.) is done by sending commands to the MC f/w.

Note that the CAAM accelerator included in DPAA2 platforms still has
Job Rings. However, the driver being added does not handle access
via this backend. Kconfig & Makefile are updated such that DPAA2-CAAM
(a.k.a. "caam/qi2") driver does not depend on caam/jr or caam/qi
backends - which rely on platform bus support (ctrl.c).

Support for the following aead and authenc algorithms is also added
in this patch:
-aead:
gcm(aes)
rfc4106(gcm(aes))
rfc4543(gcm(aes))
-authenc:
authenc(hmac({md5,sha*}),cbc({aes,des,des3_ede}))
echainiv(authenc(hmac({md5,sha*}),cbc({aes,des,des3_ede})))
authenc(hmac({md5,sha*}),rfc3686(ctr(aes))
seqiv(authenc(hmac({md5,sha*}),rfc3686(ctr(aes)))
