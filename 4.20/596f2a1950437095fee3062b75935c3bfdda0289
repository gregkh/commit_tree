svcrdma: Remove ->release_rqst call in bc reply handler

Similar to a change made in the client's forward channel reply
handler: The xprt_release_rqst_cong() call is not necessary.

Also, release xprt->recv_lock when taking xprt->transport_lock
to avoid disabling and enabling BH's while holding another
spin lock.
