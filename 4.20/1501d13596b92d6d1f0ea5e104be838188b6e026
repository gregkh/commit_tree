netlink: add nested array policy validation

Sometimes nested netlink attributes are just used as arrays, with
the nla_type() of each not being used; we have this in nl80211 and
e.g. NFTA_SET_ELEM_LIST_ELEMENTS.

Add the ability to validate this type of message directly in the
policy, by adding the type NLA_NESTED_ARRAY which does exactly
this: require a first level of nesting but ignore the attribute
type, and then inside each require a second level of nested and
validate those attributes against a given policy (if present).

Note that some nested array types actually require that all of
the entries have the same index, this is possible to express in
a nested policy already, apart from the validation that only the
one allowed type is used.
