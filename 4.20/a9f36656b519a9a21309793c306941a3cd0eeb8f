mlxsw: spectrum: Init shaper for TCs 8..15

With introduction of MC-aware mode to mlxsw, it became necessary to
configure TCs above 7 as well. There is now code in mlxsw to disable ETS
for these higher classes, but disablement of max shaper was neglected.

By default, max shaper is currently disabled to begin with, so the
problem is just cosmetic. However, for symmetry, do like we do for ETS
configuration, and call mlxsw_sp_port_ets_maxrate_set() for both TC i
and i + 8.
