net: restore call to netdev_queue_numa_node_write when resetting XPS

Before commit 80d19669ecd3 ("net: Refactor XPS for CPUs and Rx queues"),
netif_reset_xps_queues() did netdev_queue_numa_node_write() for all the
queues being reset. Now, this is only done when the "active" variable in
clean_xps_maps() is false, ie when on all the CPUs, there's no active
XPS mapping left.
