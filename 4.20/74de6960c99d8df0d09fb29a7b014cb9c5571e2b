rcu: Provide functions for determining if call_rcu() has been invoked

This commit adds rcu_head_init() and rcu_head_after_call_rcu() functions
to help RCU users detect when another CPU has passed the specified
rcu_head structure and function to call_rcu().  The rcu_head_init()
should be invoked before making the structure visible to RCU readers,
and then the rcu_head_after_call_rcu() may be invoked from within
an RCU read-side critical section on an rcu_head structure that
was obtained during a traversal of the data structure in question.
The rcu_head_after_call_rcu() function will return true if the rcu_head
structure has already been passed (with the specified function) to
call_rcu(), otherwise it will return false.

If rcu_head_init() has not been invoked on the rcu_head structure
or if the rcu_head (AKA callback) has already been invoked, then
rcu_head_after_call_rcu() will do WARN_ON_ONCE().
