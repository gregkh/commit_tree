KVM: s390: introduce and use KVM_REQ_VSIE_RESTART

When we change the crycb (or execution controls), we also have to make sure
that the vSIE shadow datastructures properly consider the changed
values before rerunning the vSIE. We can achieve that by simply using a
VCPU request now.

This has to be a synchronous request (== handled before entering the
(v)SIE again).

The request will make sure that the vSIE handler is left, and that the
request will be processed (NOP), therefore forcing a reload of all
vSIE data (including rebuilding the crycb) when re-entering the vSIE
interception handler the next time.
