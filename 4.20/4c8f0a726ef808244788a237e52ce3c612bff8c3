perf trace augmented_syscalls: Rename augmented_*_syscall__enter to just *_syscall

As we'll also hook into the syscalls:sys_exit_SYSCALL for which there
are enter hooks.

This way we'll be able to iterate the ELF file for the eBPF program,
find the syscalls that have hooks and filter them out from the general
raw_syscalls:sys_{enter,exit} tracepoint for not-yet-augmented (the ones
with pointer arguments not yet being attached to the usual syscalls
tracepoint payload) and non augmentable syscalls (syscalls without
pointer arguments).
