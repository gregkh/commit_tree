ocfs2: fix clusters leak in ocfs2_defrag_extent()

ocfs2_defrag_extent() might leak allocated clusters.  When the file
system has insufficient space, the number of claimed clusters might be
less than the caller wants.  If that happens, the original code might
directly commit the transaction without returning clusters.

This patch is based on code in ocfs2_add_clusters_in_btree().
