powerpc/64: Fix kernel stack 16-byte alignment

Commit 4c2de74cc869 ("powerpc/64: Interrupts save PPR on stack rather
than thread_struct") changed sizeof(struct pt_regs) % 16 from 0 to 8,
which causes the interrupt frame allocation on kernel entry to put the
kernel stack out of alignment.

Quadword (16-byte) alignment for the stack is required by both the
64-bit v1 ABI (v1.9 ยง 3.2.2) and the 64-bit v2 ABI (v1.1 ยง 2.2.2.1).

Add a pad field to fix alignment, and add a BUILD_BUG_ON to catch this
in future.
