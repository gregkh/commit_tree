drm/amd/display: fix gamma not being applied

[WHY]
Previously night light forced a full update by
applying a  transfer function update regardless of if it was changed.
This logic was removed,

Now gamma surface updates are only applied when there is also a plane
info update, this does not work in cases such as using the night light
slider.

[HOW]
When moving the night light slider we will perform a full update if
the gamma has changed and there is a surface, even when the surface
has not changed. Also get stream updates in setgamma prior to
update planes and stream.
