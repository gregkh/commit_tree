bpf, libbpf: simplify and cleanup perf ring buffer walk

Simplify bpf_perf_event_read_simple() a bit and fix up some minor
things along the way: the return code in the header is not of type
int but enum bpf_perf_event_ret instead. Once callback indicated
to break the loop walking event data, it also needs to be consumed
in data_tail since it has been processed already.

Moreover, bpf_perf_event_print_t callback should avoid void * as
we actually get a pointer to struct perf_event_header and thus
applications can make use of container_of() to have type checks.
The walk also doesn't have to use modulo op since the ring size is
required to be power of two.
