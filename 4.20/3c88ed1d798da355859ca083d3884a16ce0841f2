net: hns3: bugfix for handling mailbox while the command queue reinitialized

In a multi-core machine, the mailbox service and reset service
will be executed at the same time. The reset service will re-initialize
the command queue, before that, the mailbox handler can only get some
invalid messages.

The HCLGE_STATE_CMD_DISABLE flag means that the command queue is not
available and needs to be reinitialized. Therefore, when the mailbox
handler recognizes this flag, it should not process the command.
