KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Allow HV module to load without hypervisor mode

With this, the KVM-HV module can be loaded in a guest running under
KVM-HV, and if the hypervisor supports nested virtualization, this
guest can now act as a nested hypervisor and run nested guests.

This also adds some checks to inform userspace that HPT guests are not
supported by nested hypervisors (by returning false for the
KVM_CAP_PPC_MMU_HASH_V3 capability), and to prevent userspace from
configuring a guest to use HPT mode.
