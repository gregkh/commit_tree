brcmsmac: Use kvmalloc() for ucode allocations

The ucode chunk might be relatively large and the allocation with
kmalloc() may fail occasionally.  Since the data isn't DMA-transferred
but by manual loops, we can use vmalloc instead of kmalloc.
For a better performance, though, kvmalloc() would be the best choice
in such a case, so let's replace with it.
