bpf: fix direct packet access for flow dissector progs

Commit d58e468b1112 ("flow_dissector: implements flow dissector BPF
hook") added direct packet access for skbs in may_access_direct_pkt_data()
function where this enables read and write access to the skb->data. This
is buggy because without a prologue generator such as bpf_unclone_prologue()
we would allow for writing into cloned skbs. Original intention might have
been to only allow read access where this is not needed (similar as the
flow_dissector_func_proto() indicates which enables only bpf_skb_load_bytes()
as well), therefore this patch fixes it to restrict to read-only.
