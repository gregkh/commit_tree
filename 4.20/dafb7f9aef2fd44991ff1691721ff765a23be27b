v4l2-controls: add a missing include

As warned by "make headers_check", the definition for the linux-specific
integer types is missing:

	./usr/include/linux/v4l2-controls.h:1105: found __[us]{8,16,32,64} type without #include <linux/types.h>

Fixes: c27bb30e7b6d ("media: v4l: Add definitions for MPEG-2 slice format and metadata")
