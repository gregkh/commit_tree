PCI: pciehp: Rename controller struct members for clarity

Of the members which were just moved from pciehp's slot struct to the
controller struct, rename "lock" to "state_lock" and rename "work" to
"button_work" for clarity.  Perform the rename separately to the
unification of the two structs per Sinan's request.

No functional change intended.
