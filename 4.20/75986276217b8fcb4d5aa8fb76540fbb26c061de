drm/amdgpu: fix the page fault of raven2

While the apg_end address is 0xffffffff, if add 1 with it, the value will be
overflow and roll back to 0. So when 0 is written to
mmMC_VM_SYSTEM_APERTURE_HIGH_ADDR, the system aperture is actually disabled. And
so any access to vram will trigger a page fault.

Raven2's HW issue only need increase the vram end address, and needn't do it on
the agp.
