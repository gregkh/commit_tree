kvm: arm64: Prepare for dynamic stage2 page table layout

Our stage2 page table helpers are statically defined based
on the fixed IPA of 40bits and the host page size. As we are
about to add support for configurable IPA size for VMs, we
need to make the page table checks for each VM. This patch
prepares the stage2 helpers to make the transition to a VM
dependent table layout easier. Instead of statically defining
the table helpers based on the page table levels, we now
check the page table levels in the helpers to do the right
thing. In effect, it simply converts the macros to static
inline functions.
