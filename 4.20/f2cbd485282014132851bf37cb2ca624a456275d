net/sched: act_police: fix race condition on state variables

after 'police' configuration parameters were converted to use RCU instead
of spinlock, the state variables used to compute the traffic rate (namely
'tcfp_toks', 'tcfp_ptoks' and 'tcfp_t_c') are erroneously read/updated in
the traffic path without any protection.

Use a dedicated spinlock to avoid race conditions on these variables, and
ensure proper cache-line alignment. In this way, 'police' is still faster
than what we observed when 'tcf_lock' was used in the traffic path _ i.e.
reverting commit 2d550dbad83c ("net/sched: act_police: don't use spinlock
in the data path"). Moreover, we preserve the throughput improvement that
was obtained after 'police' started using per-cpu counters, when 'avrate'
is used instead of 'rate'.

Changes since v1 (thanks to Eric Dumazet):
- call ktime_get_ns() before acquiring the lock in the traffic path
- use a dedicated spinlock instead of tcf_lock
- improve cache-line usage
