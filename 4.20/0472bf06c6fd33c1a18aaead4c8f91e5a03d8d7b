xhci: Prevent U1/U2 link pm states if exit latency is too long

Don't allow USB3 U1 or U2 if the latency to wake up from the U-state
reaches the service interval for a periodic endpoint.

This is according to xhci 1.1 specification section 4.23.5.2 extra note:

"Software shall ensure that a device is prevented from entering a U-state
 where its worst case exit latency approaches the ESIT."

Allowing too long exit latencies for periodic endpoint confuses xHC
internal scheduling, and new devices may fail to enumerate with a
"Not enough bandwidth for new device state" error from the host.
