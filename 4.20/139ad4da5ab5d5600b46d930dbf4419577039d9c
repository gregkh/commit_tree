rcu: Remove rsp parameter from rcu_report_unblock_qs_rnp()

There now is only one rcu_state structure in a given build of the
Linux kernel, so there is no need to pass it as a parameter to RCU's
functions.  This commit therefore removes the rsp parameter from
rcu_report_unblock_qs_rnp(), which is particularly appropriate in
this case given that this parameter is no longer used.
