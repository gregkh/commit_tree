staging: fsl-dpaa2/eth: Delay netdev_register() call

Only call netdev_register() at the end of the probe function,
once all other necessary bits and pieces are properly initialized.

We keep the rest of the netdevice initialization code in place,
at the earlier point of the probing sequence, including the
settings previously done in ndo_init.
