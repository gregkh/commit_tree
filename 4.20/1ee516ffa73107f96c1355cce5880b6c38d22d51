drm/i915: Fix logic fumble in rotation vs. ccs check

Smatch reports:
../drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_sprite.c:1192 skl_plane_check_fb() warn: was || intended here instead of &&?

Obviously smatch is correct here since we're trying to check if we're
using either of the ccs modifiers. Since we now have is_ccs_modifier()
let's use it to fix this.
