drm: Add drm/drm_util.h header file

We have a bunch of neat little macros all over the place which should
move to kernel.h. But some of them died in bikesheds on lkml, and we
need a decent home for them.

Start out by moving the for_each_if macro there.

v2: Rename to drm_util.h instead (Dave&Sean)
