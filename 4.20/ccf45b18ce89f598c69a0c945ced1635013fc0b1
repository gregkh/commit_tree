rpmsg: char: Migrate to iter versions of read and write

In order to be able to use the aio interface for writing to a rpmsg_char
the write_iter function must be implemented, so migrate to iter version
for read and write functions.

Regular read and write uses the iter methods if present and is as such
unaffected.
