ASoC: simple-card: support snd_soc_dai_link_component style for platform

Current ASoC is supporting snd_soc_dai_link_component for binding,
it is more useful than current legacy style.
Currently only codec is supporting it as multicodec (= codecs).
CPU will support multi style in the future.
We want to have it on Platform too in the future.

If all Codec/CPU/Platform are replaced into snd_soc_dai_link_component
style, we can remove legacy complex style.
This patch supports snd_soc_dai_link_component style
for simple-card for platform.

[current]
struct snd_soc_dai_link {
	...
	*cpu_name;
	*cpu_of_node;
	*cpu_dai_name;

	*codec_name;
	*codec_of_node;
	*codec_dai_name;
	*codecs;
	num_codecs;

	*platform_name;
	*platform_of_node;
	...
}

[in the future]
struct snd_soc_dai_link {
	...
	*cpus
	num_cpus;

	*codecs;
	num_codecs;

	*platform;
	...
}
