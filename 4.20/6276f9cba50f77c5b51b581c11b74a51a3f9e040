coresight: tmc-etr: Refactor for handling errors

Refactor the tmc-etr enable operation to make it easier to
handle errors in enabling the hardware. We need to make
sure that the buffer is compatible with the ETR. This
patch re-arranges to make the error handling easier, by
deferring the hardware enablement until all the errors
are checked. This also avoids turning the CATU on/off
during a sysfs read session.
