ALSA: hda/realtek - fix the pop noise on headphone for lenovo laptops

We have several Lenovo laptops with the codec alc285, when playing
sound via headphone, we can hear click/pop noise in the headphone,
if we let the headphone share the DAC of NID 0x2 with the speaker,
the noise disappears.

The Lenovo laptops here include P52, P72, X1 yoda2 and X1 carbon.

I have tried to set preferred_dacs and override_conn, but neither of
them worked. Thanks for Kailang, he told me to invalidate the NID 0x3
through override_wcaps.
