Compiler Attributes: always use the extra-underscores syntax

The attribute syntax optionally allows to surround attribute names
with "__" in order to avoid collisions with macros of the same name
(see https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Attribute-Syntax.html).

This homogenizes all attributes to use the syntax with underscores.
While there are currently only a handful of cases of some TUs defining
macros like "error" which may collide with the attributes,
this should prevent futures surprises.

This has been done only for "standard" attributes supported by
the major compilers. In other words, those of third-party tools
(e.g. sparse, plugins...) have not been changed for the moment.
