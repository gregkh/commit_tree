drm/i915: Flag any possible writes for a GTT fault

We do not explicitly mark the PTE for the user's GTT mmap as being
wrprotect, so we don't get a refault when we would need to change a
read-only mmapping into read-write. As such, we must presume that if the
vma has PROT_WRITE it may be written to, although this is supposed to be
indicated by set-domain there are cases (e.g. after swap) where
userspace may not be aware of the implicit domain change.
