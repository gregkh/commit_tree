kernel/sched/psi.c: simplify cgroup_move_task()

The existing code triggered an invalid warning about 'rq' possibly being
used uninitialized.  Instead of doing the silly warning suppression by
initializa it to NULL, refactor the code to bail out early instead.

Warning was:

  kernel/sched/psi.c: In function `cgroup_move_task':
  kernel/sched/psi.c:639:13: warning: `rq' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
