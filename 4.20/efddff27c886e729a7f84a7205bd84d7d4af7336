mfd: max8997: Enale irq-wakeup unconditionally

IRQ wake up support for MAX8997 driver was initially configured by
respective property in pdata. However, after the driver conversion to
device-tree, setting it was left as 'todo'. Nowadays most of other PMIC MFD
drivers initialized from device-tree assume that they can be an irq wakeup
source, so enable it also for MAX8997. This fixes support for wakeup from
MAX8997 RTC alarm.
