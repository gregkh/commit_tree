apparmor: don't try to replace stale label in ptraceme check

begin_current_label_crit_section() must run in sleepable context because
when label_is_stale() is true, aa_replace_current_label() runs, which uses
prepare_creds(), which can sleep.

Until now, the ptraceme access check (which runs with tasklist_lock held)
violated this rule.
