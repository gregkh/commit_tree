drm/amd/display: Print DPP DTN log info only for enabled pipes

[why]
There is currently a dependency on the order in which tests are executed.
This is because the non-relevant state info is being printed, which results
in the output based on the state from the previous test.

[how]
Print DPP DTN log only if the pipe is enabled.
In addition to the affected per-submission DTN golden logs, included in this
change is also DTN golden log update for pre-submission tests.
The other DTN golden logs affected by this change will be updated upon
nightly test run (which will generate the updated DTN logs).
