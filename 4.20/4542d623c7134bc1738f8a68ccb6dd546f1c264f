vhost/scsi: truncate T10 PI iov_iter to prot_bytes

Commands with protection information included were not truncating the
protection iov_iter to the number of protection bytes in the command.
This resulted in vhost_scsi mis-calculating the size of the protection
SGL in vhost_scsi_calc_sgls(), and including both the protection and
data SG entries in the protection SGL.
