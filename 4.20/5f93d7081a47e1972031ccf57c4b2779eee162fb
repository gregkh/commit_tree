macintosh/via-macii: Remove BUG_ON assertions

The BUG_ON assertions I added to the via-macii driver over a decade ago
haven't fired AFAIK. Some can never fire (by inspection). One assertion
checks for a NULL pointer, but that would merely substitute a BUG crash
for an Oops crash. Remove the pointless BUG_ON assertions and replace
the others with a WARN_ON and an array bounds check.
