signal/ia64: Use the force_sig(SIGSEGV,...) in ia64_rt_sigreturn

The ia64 handling of failure to return from a signal frame has been trying
to set overlapping fields in struct siginfo since 2.3.43.  The si_code
corresponds to the fields that were stomped (not the field that is
actually written), so I can not imagine a piece of userspace code
making sense of the signal frame if it looks closely.

In practice failure to return from a signal frame is a rare event that
almost never happens.  Someone using an alternate signal stack to
recover and looking in detail is even more rare.  So I presume no one
has ever noticed and reported this ia64 nonsense.

Sort this out by causing ia64 to use force_sig(SIGSEGV) like other architectures.

Fixes: 2.3.43
