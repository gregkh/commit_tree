btrfs: remove redundant variable from btrfs_cross_ref_exist

Since commit d7df2c796d7e ("Btrfs attach delayed ref updates to delayed
ref heads"), check_delayed_ref() won't return -ENOENT.

In btrfs_cross_ref_exist(), two variables 'ret' and 'ret2' are
originally used to handle -ENOENT error case.  Since the code is not
needed anymore, let's just remove 'ret2'.
