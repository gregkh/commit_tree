SUNRPC: Remove xprt_connect_status()

Over the years, xprt_connect_status() has been superseded by
call_connect_status(), which now handles all the errors that
xprt_connect_status() does and more. Since the latter converts
all errors that it doesn't recognise to EIO, then it is time
for it to be retired.
