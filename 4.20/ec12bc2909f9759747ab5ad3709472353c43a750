lib/vsprintf: Hash legacy clock addresses

On platforms using the Common Clock Framework, "%pC" prints the clock's
name. On legacy platforms, it prints the unhashed clock's address,
potentially leaking sensitive information regarding the kernel layout in
memory.

Avoid this leak by printing the hashed address instead.  To distinguish
between clocks, a 32-bit unique identifier is as good as an actual
pointer value.
