soc/tegra: pmc: Fix child-node lookup

Fix child-node lookup during probe, which ended up searching the whole
device tree depth-first starting at the parent rather than just matching
on its children.

To make things worse, the parent pmc node could end up being prematurely
freed as of_find_node_by_name() drops a reference to its first argument.
