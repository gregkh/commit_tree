char: pcmcia: cm4000_cs: Replace mdelay with usleep_range in set_protocol

set_protocol() is never called in atomic context.

The call chains ending up at set_protocol() are:
[1] set_protocol() <- monitor_card()
[2] set_protocol() <- cmm_ioctl()
monitor_card() is only set in setup_timer(), and cmm_ioctl() is only
set as ".unlocked_ioctl" in file_operations structure "cm4000_fops".

Despite never getting called from atomic context, set_protocol() calls
mdelay(10), i.e. busy wait for 10ms.
That is not necessary and can be replaced with usleep_range to
avoid busy waiting.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
