HID: quirks: fix RetroUSB.com devices

SNES RetroPort and RetroPad register only 4 gamepad buttons
when they should register all 8 buttons. This is described here:

https://ask.fedoraproject.org/en/question/128102

This is happening because of:

Commit 190d7f02ce8e ("HID: input: do not increment usages when
    duplicate is found")

Here, I add the quirk HID_QUIRK_INCREMENT_USAGE_ON_DUPLICATE
(created for backward compatibility with the change in 190d7f02ce8e)
for the two products.

Tested with both RetroPort and RetroPad.
