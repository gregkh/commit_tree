staging: most: video: fix registration of an empty comp core_component

Currently we have structrues comp (which is empty) and comp_info being
used to register and deregister the component.  This mismatch in naming
occurred from a previous commit that renamed aim_info to comp. Fix this
to use consistent component naming in line with most/net, most/sound etc.

This fixes the message two issues, one with a null empty name when
loading the module:

[ 1485.269515] most_core: registered new core component (null)

and an Oops when removing the module:
