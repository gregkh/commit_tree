mm: calculate deferred pages after skipping mirrored memory

update_defer_init() should be called only when struct page is about to be
initialized. Because it counts number of initialized struct pages, but
there we may skip struct pages if there is some mirrored memory.

So move, update_defer_init() after checking for mirrored memory.

Also, rename update_defer_init() to defer_init() and reverse the return
boolean to emphasize that this is a boolean function, that tells that the
reset of memmap initialization should be deferred.

Make this function self-contained: do not pass number of already
initialized pages in this zone by using static counters.

I found this bug by reading the code.  The effect is that fewer than
expected struct pages are initialized early in boot, and it is possible
that in some corner cases we may fail to boot when mirrored pages are
used.  The deferred on demand code should somewhat mitigate this.  But
this still brings some inconsistencies compared to when booting without
mirrored pages, so it is better to fix.
