media: vicodec: change codec license to LGPL

The FWHT codec can also be used by userspace utilities and libraries, but
since the current license is GPL and not LGPL it is not possible to include
it in e.g. gstreamer, since LGPL is required for that.

Change the license of these four files to LGPL.
