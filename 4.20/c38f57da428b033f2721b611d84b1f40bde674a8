vhost/vsock: fix reset orphans race with close timeout

If a local process has closed a connected socket and hasn't received a
RST packet yet, then the socket remains in the table until a timeout
expires.

When a vhost_vsock instance is released with the timeout still pending,
the socket is never freed because vhost_vsock has already set the
SOCK_DONE flag.

Check if the close timer is pending and let it close the socket.  This
prevents the race which can leak sockets.
