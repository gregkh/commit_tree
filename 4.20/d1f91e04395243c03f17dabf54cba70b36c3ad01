staging:rtl8192u: Rename Dot11d_UpdateCountryIe - Style

The function Dot11d_UpdateCountryIe causes a checkpatch issue due to
its use of CamelCase naming, the function has been renamed to
dot11d_update_country_ie.

This is a coding style change which should have no impact on runtime
code execution.
