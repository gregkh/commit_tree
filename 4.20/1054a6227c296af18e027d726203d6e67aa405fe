octeontx2-af: Gather RVU blocks HW info

This patch gathers NPA/NIX/SSO/SSOW/TIM/CPT RVU blocks's
HW info like number of LFs. Important register offsets
saved for later use to avoid code duplication for each block.
A bitmap is allocated for each of the blocks which later
on will be used to allocate a LF for a RVU PF/VF.

Also added RVU NIX/NPA block registers and few registers
of other blocks.
