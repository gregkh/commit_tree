locking/lockdep: Make global debug_locks* variables read-mostly

Make the frequently used lockdep global variable debug_locks read-mostly.
As debug_locks_silent is sometime used together with debug_locks,
it is also made read-mostly so that they can be close together.

With false cacheline sharing, cacheline contention problem can happen
depending on what get put into the same cacheline as debug_locks.
