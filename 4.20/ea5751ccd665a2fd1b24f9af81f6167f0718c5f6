proc/sysctl: don't return ENOMEM on lookup when a table is unregistering

proc_sys_lookup can fail with ENOMEM instead of ENOENT when the
corresponding sysctl table is being unregistered. In our case we see
this upon opening /proc/sys/net/*/conf files while network interfaces
are being deleted, which confuses our configuration daemon.

The problem was successfully reproduced and this fix tested on v4.9.122
and v4.20-rc6.

v2: return ERR_PTRs in all cases when proc_sys_make_inode fails instead
of mixing them with NULL. Thanks Al Viro for the feedback.
