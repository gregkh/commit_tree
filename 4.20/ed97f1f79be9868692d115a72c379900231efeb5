xprtrdma: Conventional variable names in rpcrdma_conn_upcall

Clean up: The convention throughout other parts of xprtrdma is to
name variables of type struct rpcrdma_xprt "r_xprt", not "xprt".
This convention enables the use of the name "xprt" for a "struct
rpc_xprt" type variable, as in other parts of the RPC client.
