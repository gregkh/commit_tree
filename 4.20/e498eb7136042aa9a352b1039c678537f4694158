drm/amd/display: Add support for hw_state logging via debugfs

[Why]

We have logging methods for printing hardware state for newer ASICs
but no way to trigger the log output.

[How]

Add support for triggering the output via writing to a debugfs file
entry. Log output currently goes into dmesg for convenience, but
accessing via a read should be possible later.
