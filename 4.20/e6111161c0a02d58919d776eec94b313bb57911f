xen/pvh: don't try to unplug emulated devices

A Xen PVH guest has no associated qemu device model, so trying to
unplug any emulated devices is making no sense at all.

Bail out early from xen_unplug_emulated_devices() when running as PVH
guest. This will avoid issuing the boot message:

[    0.000000] Xen Platform PCI: unrecognised magic value
