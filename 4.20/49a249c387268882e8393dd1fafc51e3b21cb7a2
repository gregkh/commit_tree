tools/bpftool: copy a few net uapi headers to tools directory

Commit f6f3bac08ff9 ("tools/bpf: bpftool: add net support")
added certain networking support to bpftool.
The implementation relies on a relatively recent uapi header file
linux/tc_act/tc_bpf.h on the host which contains the marco
definition of TCA_ACT_BPF_ID.

Unfortunately, this is not the case for all distributions.
See the email message below where rhel-7.2 does not have
an up-to-date linux/tc_act/tc_bpf.h.

Further investigation found that linux/pkt_cls.h is also needed for macro
TCA_BPF_TAG.

This patch fixed the issue by copying linux/tc_act/tc_bpf.h
and linux/pkt_cls.h from kernel include/uapi directory to
tools/include/uapi directory so building the bpftool does not depend
on host system for these files.
