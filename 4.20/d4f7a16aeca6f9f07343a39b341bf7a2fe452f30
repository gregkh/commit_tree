scsi: qla2xxx: Remove ASYNC GIDPN switch command

Using GPNFT/GNNFT command will be able to cover switch database with less
number of scans. This patch removes Get NportID with provided WWPN/GIDPN
switch command. By making this change, in large fabric with lots of remote
port or NPIV ports with noisy SAN, the number of GIDPN commands issued by a
port when it detects large number of remote ports going away or coming back,
can overwhelmn the switch and it can becomde unresponsive. In a case where the
fabric has not change, GIDPN is not required.
