KVM: nVMX: assimilate nested_vmx_entry_failure() into nested_vmx_enter_non_root_mode()

Handling all VMExits due to failed consistency checks on VMEnter in
nested_vmx_enter_non_root_mode() consolidates all relevant code into
a single location, and removing nested_vmx_entry_failure() eliminates
a confusing function name and label.  For a VMEntry, "fail" and its
derivatives has a very specific meaning due to the different behavior
of a VMEnter VMFail versus VMExit, i.e. it wasn't obvious that
nested_vmx_entry_failure() handled VMExit scenarios.
