arm64: dts: marvell: add macro to make distinction between node names

Because the label is different between CPs, the full path of a node is
unique. However, when referring to the end of the path only (the node
name), this name is not unique anymore.

The *thermal_zone_of_sensor_register() functions of the thermal core
present this limitation and prevent having a thermal-zone per CP.

Add a macro to make the distinction between node names to solve this
situation.
