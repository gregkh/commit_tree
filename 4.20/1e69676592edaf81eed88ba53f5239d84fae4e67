rcutorture: Limit reader duration if irq or bh disabled

There are debug checks in some environments that will complain if the
duration of a bh-disabled region of code exceeds about 50 milliseconds.
Because rcu_read_delay() can produce a 50-millisecond delay and because
there could be up to eight reader segments with such delays, this commit
limits the maximum delay to 10 milliseconds if either interrupts or
softirqs are disabled.
