drm/i915/mst: Do not retrain new links

The short pulse handler checks if channel equalization is okay and
goes onto retrain a link if there are active MST links. This retraining
path is not meant for new MST connections, but due to a bug elsewhere, if
active_mst_links is < 0 the boolean check for active_mst_links passes and
we proceed to retrain a new link. This results in a sequence of failed link
training attempts, most likely due to the hardware not setup for link
training at that point i.e., missing the DDI pre_enable sequence.

[   80.301272] [drm:intel_dp_check_mst_status] channel EQ not ok, retraining
[   80.301312] [drm:intel_ddi_prepare_link_retrain] *ERROR* Timeout waiting for DDI BUF C idle bit

The above error gives us a hint something went wrong before link
training started.

Check for a positive value of active_mst_links and throw in a warning for
invalid active_mst_links as debug aid.
