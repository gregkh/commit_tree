rcu: Eliminate grace-period management code use of rsp

Now that there is only one rcu_state structure, there is less point
in maintaining a pointer to it.  This commit therefore replaces
rsp with &rcu_state in rcu_start_this_gp(), rcu_accelerate_cbs(),
__note_gp_changes(), rcu_gp_init(), rcu_gp_fqs(), rcu_gp_cleanup(),
rcu_gp_kthread(), and rcu_report_qs_rsp().
