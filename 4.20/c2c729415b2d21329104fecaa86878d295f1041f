coresight: platform: Cleanup coresight connection handling

The platform code parses the component connections and populates
a platform-description of the output connections in arrays of fields
(which is never freed). This is later copied in the coresight_register
to a newly allocated area, represented by coresight_connection(s).

This patch cleans up the code dealing with connections by making
use of the "coresight_connection" structure right at the platform
code and lets the generic driver simply re-use information provided
by the platform.

Thus making it reader friendly as well as avoiding the wastage of
unused memory.
