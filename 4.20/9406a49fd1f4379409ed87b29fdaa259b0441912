dma-mapping: support non-coherent devices in dma_common_get_sgtable

We can use the arch_dma_coherent_to_pfn hook to provide a ->get_sgtable
implementation.  Note that this isn't an endorsement of this interface
(which is a horrible bad idea), but it is required to move arm64 over
to the generic code without a loss of functionality.
