MIPS/PCI: Call pcie_bus_configure_settings() to set MPS/MRRS

Call pcie_bus_configure_settings() on MIPS, like for other platforms.
The function pcie_bus_configure_settings() makes sure the MPS (Max
Payload Size) across the bus is uniform and provides the ability to
tune the MRSS (Max Read Request Size) and MPS (Max Payload Size) to
higher performance values. Some devices will not operate properly if
these aren't set correctly because the firmware doesn't always do it.
