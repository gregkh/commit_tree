scsi: ufs-bsg: Add support for raw upiu in ufs_bsg_request()

Do that for the currently supported UPIUs: query, nop out, and task
management.

We do not support UPIU of type scsi command yet, while we are using the
job's request and reply pointers to hold the payload.  We will look into
it in later patches. We might need to elaborate the raw upiu api for
that.

We also still not supporting uic commands: For first phase, we plan to
use the existing api, and send only uic commands that are already
supported. Anyway, all that will come in the next patch.
