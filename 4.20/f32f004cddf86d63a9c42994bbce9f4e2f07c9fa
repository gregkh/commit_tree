ida: Convert to XArray

Use the XA_TRACK_FREE ability to track which entries have a free bit,
similarly to how it uses the radix tree's IDR_FREE tag.  This eliminates
the per-cpu ida_bitmap preload, and fixes the memory consumption
regression I introduced when making the IDR able to store any pointer.
