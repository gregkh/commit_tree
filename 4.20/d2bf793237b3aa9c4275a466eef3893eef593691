selftests/powerpc: Add test to verify rfi flush across a system call

This adds a test to verify proper functioning of the rfi flush
capability implemented to mitigate meltdown. The test works by
measuring the number of L1d cache misses encountered while loading
data from memory. Across a system call, since the L1d cache is flushed
when rfi_flush is enabled, the number of cache misses is expected to
be relative to the number of cachelines corresponding to the data
being loaded.

The current system setting is reflected via powerpc/rfi_flush under
debugfs (assumed to be /sys/kernel/debug/). This test verifies the
expected result with rfi_flush enabled as well as when it is disabled.
