powerpc/64: Interrupts save PPR on stack rather than thread_struct

PPR is the odd register out when it comes to interrupt handling, it is
saved in current->thread.ppr while all others are saved on the stack.

The difficulty with this is that accessing thread.ppr can cause a SLB
fault, but the SLB fault handler implementation in C change had
assumed the normal exception entry handlers would not cause an SLB
fault.

Fix this by allocating room in the interrupt stack to save PPR.
