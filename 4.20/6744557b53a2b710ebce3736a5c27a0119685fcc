vfs: allow some remap flags to be passed to vfs_clone_file_range

In overlayfs, ovl_remap_file_range calls vfs_clone_file_range on the
lower filesystem's inode, passing through whatever remap flags it got
from its caller.  Since vfs_copy_file_range first tries a filesystem's
remap function with REMAP_FILE_CAN_SHORTEN, this can get passed through
to the second vfs_copy_file_range call, and this isn't an issue.
Change the WARN_ON to look only for the DEDUP flag.
