KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't access HFSCR, LPIDR or LPCR when running nested

When running as a nested hypervisor, this avoids reading hypervisor
privileged registers (specifically HFSCR, LPIDR and LPCR) at startup;
instead reasonable default values are used.  This also avoids writing
LPIDR in the single-vcpu entry/exit path.

Also, this removes the check for CPU_FTR_HVMODE in kvmppc_mmu_hv_init()
since its only caller already checks this.
