hwmon: (ina3221) Fix INA3221_CONFIG_MODE macros

The three INA3221_CONFIG_MODE macros are not correctly defined here.
The MODE3-1 bits are located at BIT 2-0 according to the datasheet.

So this patch just fixes them by shifting all of them with a correct
offset. However, this isn't a crital bug fix as the driver does not
use any of them at this point.
