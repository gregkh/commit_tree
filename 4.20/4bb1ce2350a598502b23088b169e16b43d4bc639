serial: uartps: console_setup() can't be placed to init section

When console device is rebinded, console_setup() is called again.
But marking it as __init means that function will be clear after boot is
complete. If console device is binded again console_setup() is not found
and error "Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address"
is reported.
