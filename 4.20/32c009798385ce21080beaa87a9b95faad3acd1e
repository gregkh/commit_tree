samples/bpf: fix compilation failure

following commit:
commit d58e468b1112 ("flow_dissector: implements flow dissector BPF hook")
added struct bpf_flow_keys which conflicts with the struct with
same name in sockex2_kern.c and sockex3_kern.c

similar to commit:
commit 534e0e52bc23 ("samples/bpf: fix a compilation failure")
we tried the rename it "flow_keys" but it also conflicted with struct
having same name in include/net/flow_dissector.h. Hence renaming the
struct to "flow_key_record". Also, this commit doesn't fix the
compilation error completely because the similar struct is present in
sockex3_kern.c. Hence renaming it in both files sockex3_user.c and
sockex3_kern.c
