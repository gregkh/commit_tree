tipc: add SYN bit to connection setup messages

Messages intended for intitating a connection are currently
indistinguishable from regular datagram messages. The TIPC
protocol specification defines bit 17 in word 0 as a SYN bit
to allow sanity check of such messages in the listening socket,
but this has so far never been implemented.

We do that in this commit.
