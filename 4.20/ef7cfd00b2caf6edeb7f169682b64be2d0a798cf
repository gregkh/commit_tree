kbuild: fix false positive warning/error about missing libelf

For the same reason as commit 25896d073d8a ("x86/build: Fix compiler
support check for CONFIG_RETPOLINE"), you cannot put this $(error ...)
into the parse stage of the top Makefile.

Perhaps I'd propose a more sophisticated solution later, but this is
the best I can do for now.
