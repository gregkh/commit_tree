drm_dp_cec: add note about good MegaChips 2900 CEC support

A big problem with DP CEC-Tunneling-over-AUX is that it is tricky
to find adapters with a chipset that supports this AND where the
manufacturer actually connected the HDMI CEC line to the chipset.

Add a mention of the MegaChips 2900 chipset which seems to support
this feature well.
