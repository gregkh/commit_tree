vgic: Add support for 52bit guest physical address

Add support for handling 52bit guest physical address to the
VGIC layer. So far we have limited the guest physical address
to 48bits, by explicitly masking the upper bits. This patch
removes the restriction. We do not have to check if the host
supports 52bit as the gpa is always validated during an access.
(e.g, kvm_{read/write}_guest, kvm_is_visible_gfn()).
Also, the ITS table save-restore is also not affected with
the enhancement. The DTE entries already store the bits[51:8]
of the ITT_addr (with a 256byte alignment).
