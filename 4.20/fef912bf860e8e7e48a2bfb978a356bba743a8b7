block: genhd: add 'groups' argument to device_add_disk

Update device_add_disk() to take an 'groups' argument so that
individual drivers can register a device with additional sysfs
attributes.
This avoids race condition the driver would otherwise have if these
groups were to be created with sysfs_add_groups().
