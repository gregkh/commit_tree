drm: refuse ADDFB2 ioctl for broken bigendian drivers

Drivers must set the quirk_addfb_prefer_host_byte_order quirk to make
the drm_mode_addfb() compat code work correctly on bigendian machines.

If they don't they interpret pixel_format values incorrectly for bug
compatibility, which in turn implies the ADDFB2 ioctl does not work
correctly then.  So block it to make userspace fallback to ADDFB.
