scsi: bfa: Avoid implicit enum conversion in bfad_im_post_vendor_event

Clang warns when one enumerated type is implicitly converted to another.

drivers/scsi/bfa/bfa_fcs_lport.c:379:26: warning: implicit conversion
from enumeration type 'enum bfa_lport_aen_event' to different
enumeration type 'enum bfa_ioc_aen_event' [-Wenum-conversion]
                                  BFA_AEN_CAT_LPORT, event);
                                                     ^~~~~

The root cause of these warnings is the bfad_im_post_vendor_event
function, which expects a value from enum bfa_ioc_aen_event but there
are multiple instances of values from enums bfa_port_aen_event,
bfa_audit_aen_event, and bfa_lport_aen_event being used in this
function.

Given that this doesn't appear to be a problem since cat helps with
differentiating the events, just change evt's type to int so that no
conversion needs to happen and Clang won't warn. Update aen_type's type
in bfa_aen_entry_s as members that hold enumerated types should be int.
