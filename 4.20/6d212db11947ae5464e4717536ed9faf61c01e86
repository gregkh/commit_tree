mm: add mm_pxd_folded checks to pgtable_bytes accounting functions

The common mm code calls mm_dec_nr_pmds() and mm_dec_nr_puds()
in free_pgtables() if the address range spans a full pud or pmd.
If mm_dec_nr_puds/mm_dec_nr_pmds are non-empty due to configuration
settings they blindly subtract the size of the pmd or pud table from
pgtable_bytes even if the pud or pmd page table layer is folded.

Add explicit mm_[pmd|pud]_folded checks to the four pgtable_bytes
accounting functions mm_inc_nr_puds, mm_inc_nr_pmds, mm_dec_nr_puds
and mm_dec_nr_pmds. As the check for folded page tables can be
overwritten by the architecture, this allows to keep a correct
pgtable_bytes value for platforms that use a dynamic number of
page table levels.
