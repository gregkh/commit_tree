RDMA: Fully setup the device name in ib_register_device

The current code has two copies of the device name, ibdev->dev and
dev_name(&ibdev->dev), and they are setup at different times, which is
very confusing.

Set them both up at the same time and make dev_name() the lead name, which
is the proper use of the driver core APIs. To make it very clear that the
name is not valid until registration pass it in to the
ib_register_device() call rather than messing with ibdev->name directly.

Also the reorganization now checks that dev_name is unique even if it does
not contain a %.
