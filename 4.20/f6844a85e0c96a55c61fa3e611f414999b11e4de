drm/i915/selftests: Replace opencoded clflush with drm_clflush_virt_range

We occasionally see that the clflush prior to a read of GPU data is
returning stale data, reminiscent of much earlier bugs fixed by adding a
second clflush for serialisation. As drm_clflush_virt_range() already
supplies the workaround, use it rather than open code the clflush
instruction.
