btrfs: relocation: set trans to be NULL after ending transaction

The function relocate_block_group calls btrfs_end_transaction to release
trans when update_backref_cache returns 1, and then continues the loop
body. If btrfs_block_rsv_refill fails this time, it will jump out the
loop and the freed trans will be accessed. This may result in a
use-after-free bug. The patch assigns NULL to trans after trans is
released so that it will not be accessed.
