i2c: uniphier-f: make driver robust against concurrency

This is unlikely to happen, but it is possible for a CPU to enter
the interrupt handler just after wait_for_completion_timeout() has
expired. If this happens, the hardware is accessed from multiple
contexts concurrently.

Disable the IRQ after wait_for_completion_timeout(), and do nothing
from the handler when the IRQ is disabled.
