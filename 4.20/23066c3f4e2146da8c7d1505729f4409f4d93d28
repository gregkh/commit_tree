Compiler Attributes: enable -Wstringop-truncation on W=1 (gcc >= 8)

Commit 217c3e019675 ("disable stringop truncation warnings for now")
disabled -Wstringop-truncation since it was too noisy.

Having __nonstring available allows us to let GCC know that a string
is not meant to be NUL-terminated, which helps suppressing some
-Wstringop-truncation warnings.

Note that using __nonstring actually triggers other warnings
(-Wstringop-overflow, which is on by default) which may be real
problems. Therefore, cleaning up -Wstringop-truncation warnings
also buys us the ability to uncover further potential problems.

To encourage the use of __nonstring, we put the warning back at W=1.
In the future, if we end up with a fairly warning-free tree,
we might want to enable it by default.
