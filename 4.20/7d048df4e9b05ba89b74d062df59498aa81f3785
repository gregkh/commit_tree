xfs: fix inverted return from xfs_btree_sblock_verify_crc

xfs_btree_sblock_verify_crc is a bool so should not be returning
a failaddr_t; worse, if xfs_log_check_lsn fails it returns
__this_address which looks like a boolean true (i.e. success)
to the caller.

(interestingly xfs_btree_lblock_verify_crc doesn't have the issue)
