bpf: add TCP_SAVE_SYN/TCP_SAVED_SYN options for bpf_(set|get)sockopt

Adding support for two new bpf get/set sockopts: TCP_SAVE_SYN (set)
and TCP_SAVED_SYN (get). This would allow for bpf program to build
logic based on data from ingress SYN packet (e.g. doing tcp's tos/
tclass reflection (see sample prog)) and do it transparently from
userspace program point of view.
