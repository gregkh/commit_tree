x86/fsgsbase/64: Fix the base write helper functions

Andy spotted a regression in the fs/gs base helpers after the patch series
was committed. The helper functions which write fs/gs base are not just
writing the base, they are also changing the index. That's wrong and needs
to be separated because writing the base has not to modify the index.

While the regression is not causing any harm right now because the only
caller depends on that behaviour, it's a guarantee for subtle breakage down
the road.

Make the index explicitly changed from the caller, instead of including
the code in the helpers.

Subsequently, the task write helpers do not handle for the current task
anymore. The range check for a base value is also factored out, to minimize
code redundancy from the caller.
