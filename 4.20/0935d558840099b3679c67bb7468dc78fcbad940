netfilter: nf_tables: asynchronous release

Release the committed transaction log from a work queue, moving
expensive synchronize_rcu out of the locked section and providing
opportunity to batch this.

On my test machine this cuts runtime of nft-test.py in half.
Based on earlier patch from Pablo Neira Ayuso.
