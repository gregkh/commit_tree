net-gro: reset skb->pkt_type in napi_reuse_skb()

eth_type_trans() assumes initial value for skb->pkt_type
is PACKET_HOST.

This is indeed the value right after a fresh skb allocation.

However, it is possible that GRO merged a packet with a different
value (like PACKET_OTHERHOST in case macvlan is used), so
we need to make sure napi->skb will have pkt_type set back to
PACKET_HOST.

Otherwise, valid packets might be dropped by the stack because
their pkt_type is not PACKET_HOST.

napi_reuse_skb() was added in commit 96e93eab2033 ("gro: Add
internal interfaces for VLAN"), but this bug always has
been there.
