dmaengine: at_hdmac: fix memory leak in at_dma_xlate()

The leak was found when opening/closing a serial port a great number of
time, increasing kmalloc-32 in slabinfo.

Each time the port was opened, dma_request_slave_channel() was called.
Then, in at_dma_xlate(), atslave was allocated with devm_kzalloc() and
never freed. (Well, it was free at module unload, but that's not what we
want).
So, here, kzalloc is more suited for the job since it has to be freed in
atc_free_chan_resources().
