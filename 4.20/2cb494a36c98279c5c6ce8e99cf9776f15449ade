bpf: add tests for direct packet access from CGROUP_SKB

Tests are added to make sure CGROUP_SKB cannot access:
  tc_classid, data_meta, flow_keys

and can read and write:
  mark, prority, and cb[0-4]

and can read other fields.

To make selftest with skb->sk work, a dummy sk is added in
bpf_prog_test_run_skb().
