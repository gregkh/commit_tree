drm/omap: dss: Move debug message and checks to connection handlers

The connectors, encoders and display duplicate the same debug messages
and connection checks in their omap_dss_device connect and disconnect
handlers. Move the code to the connect and disconnect wrappers.

To simplify the code the connect function returns -EBUSY unconditionally
if the device is already connected. This doesn't cause any change in
practice: the connect handler of displays is never called on a connected
device as it is only invoked during omapdrm initialization.
