net_sched: sch_fq: ensure maxrate fq parameter applies to EDT flows

When EDT conversion happened, fq lost the ability to enfore a maxrate
for all flows. It kept it for non EDT flows.

This commit restores the functionality.

Tested:

tc qd replace dev eth0 root fq maxrate 500Mbit
netperf -P0 -H host -- -O THROUGHPUT
489.75
