serial/sunsu: fix refcount leak

The function of_find_node_by_path() acquires a reference to the node
returned by it and that reference needs to be dropped by its caller.

su_get_type() doesn't do that. The match node are used as an identifier
to compare against the current node, so we can directly drop the refcount
after getting the node from the path as it is not used as pointer.

Fix this by use a single variable and drop the refcount right after
of_find_node_by_path().
