lightnvm: pblk: fix race on sysfs line state

pblk exposes a sysfs interface that represents its internal state. Part
of this state is the map bitmap for the current open line, which should
be protected by the line lock to avoid a race when freeing the line
metadata. Currently, it is not.

This patch makes sure that the line state is consistent and NULL
bitmap pointers are not dereferenced.
