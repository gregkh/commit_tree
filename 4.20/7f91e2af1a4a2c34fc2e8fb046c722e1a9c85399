ASoC: sun4i-i2s: move code from startup/shutdown hooks into pm_runtime hooks

startup() and shutdown() hooks are called for both substreams,
so stopping either substream when another is running breaks the
latter.

E.g. playback breaks if capture is stopped when playback is running.

Move code from startup() and shutdown() to resume() and suspend()
hooks respectively to fix this issue
