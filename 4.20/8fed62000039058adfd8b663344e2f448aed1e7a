x86/mm: Break out kernel address space handling

The page fault handler (__do_page_fault())  basically has two sections:
one for handling faults in the kernel portion of the address space
and another for faults in the user portion of the address space.

But, these two parts don't stick out that well.  Let's make that more
clear from code separation and naming.  Pull kernel fault
handling into its own helper, and reflect that naming by renaming
spurious_fault() -> spurious_kernel_fault().

Also, rewrite the vmalloc() handling comment a bit.  It was a bit
stale and also glossed over the reserved bit handling.
