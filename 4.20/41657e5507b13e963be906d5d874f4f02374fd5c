xfs: Fix xqmstats offsets in /proc/fs/xfs/xqmstat

The addition of FIBT, RMAP and REFCOUNT changed the offsets into
__xfssats structure.

This caused xqmstat_proc_show() to display garbage data via
/proc/fs/xfs/xqmstat, once it relies on the offsets marked via macros.

Fix it.

Fixes: 00f4e4f9 xfs: add rmap btree stats infrastructure
Fixes: aafc3c24 xfs: support the XFS_BTNUM_FINOBT free inode btree type
Fixes: 46eeb521 xfs: introduce refcount btree definitions
