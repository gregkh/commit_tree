drm/amdkfd: Add wavefront context save state retrieval ioctl

Wavefront context save data is of interest to userspace clients for
debugging static wavefront state. The MQD contains two parameters
required to parse the control stack and the control stack itself
is kept in the MQD from gfx9 onwards.

Add an ioctl to fetch the context save area and control stack offsets
and to copy the control stack to a userspace address if it is kept in
the MQD.
