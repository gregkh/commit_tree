tracing: probeevent: Introduce new argument fetching code

Replace {k,u}probe event argument fetching framework with switch-case based.
Currently that is implemented with structures, macros and chain of
function-pointers, which is more complicated than necessary and may get a
performance penalty by retpoline.

This simplify that with an array of "fetch_insn" (opcode and oprands), and
make process_fetch_insn() just interprets it. No function pointers are used.
