net: hns3: Optimize for unicast mac vlan table

In previously implement for unicast mac vlan table, the space is
shared by all the functions, driver does nothing when the space is
exhausted. This patch preallocates the space of unicast mac vlan
table for each function by software. Each function can only use its
private space and available shared space, avoiding single function
exhausts too much space, and other functions are unable to add
unicast mac address.
