i40e: refactor Rx path for re-use

In this commit, the Rx path is refactored some, as a step torwards the
introduction AF_XDP Rx zero-copy.

The page re-use counter is moved into the i40e_reuse_rx_page, instead
of bumping the counter in many places. The Rx buffer page clearing is
moved for better readability. Lastely, functions to update statistics
and bump the XDP Tx ring are introduced.
