ath10k: advertize beacon_int_min_gcd as 100 while bring up multi vaps

With the latest firmware design, the beacon interval should be
greater than 100 to bring the multiple vaps.

Set beacon_int_min_gcd to 100, when the wmi service
WMI_SERVICE_VDEV_DIFFERENT_BEACON_INTERVAL_SUPPORT is enabled
in the firmware. If not, beacon_int_min_gcd will be set
to the default value 1.

Tested in QCA4019 with firmware ver 10.4-3.2.1.1-00015
Tested in QCA9888 with firmware ver 10.4-3.5.1-0005
