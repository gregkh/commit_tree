kbuild: add -Wno-pointer-sign flag unconditionally

We have raised the compiler requirement from time to time.
With commit cafa0010cd51 ("Raise the minimum required gcc version
to 4.6"), the minimum for GCC is 4.6 now.

The -Wno-pointer-sign has been here since the pre-git era. It is
documented in the GCC 4.6 manual, and it is recognized by Clang
and ICC as well.

Let's rip off the cc-disable-warning switch, and see if somebody
complains about it.
