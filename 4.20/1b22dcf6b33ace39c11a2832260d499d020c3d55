pcmcia: pcmcia_resource: Replace mdelay() with msleep()

pcmcia_fixup_iowidth() and pcmcia_enable_device() are
never called in atomic context.
They call mdelay() to busily wait, which is not necessary.
mdelay() can be replaced with msleep().

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
