ovl: relax requirement for non null uuid of lower fs

We use uuid to associate an overlay lower file handle with a lower layer,
so we can accept lower fs with null uuid as long as all lower layers with
null uuid are on the same fs.

This change allows enabling index and nfs_export features for the setup of
single lower fs of type squashfs - squashfs supports file handles, but has
a null uuid. This change also allows enabling index and nfs_export features
for nested overlayfs, where the lower overlay has nfs_export enabled.

Enabling the index feature with single lower squashfs fixes the
unionmount-testsuite test:
  ./run --ov --squashfs --verify

As a by-product, if, like the lower squashfs, upper fs also uses the
generic export_encode_fh() implementation to export 32bit inode file
handles (e.g. ext4), then the xino_auto config/module/mount option will
enable unique overlay inode numbers.
