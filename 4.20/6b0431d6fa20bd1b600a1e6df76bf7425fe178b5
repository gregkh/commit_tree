scsi: qla2xxx: Fix out of order Termination and ABTS response

Following changes are added by this patch

- Prevent ABTS Response from getting in front of Termination of exchange.
  Firmware requires driver to cleanup exchanges before ABTS response can be
  sent. This reduces ABTS response error which triggers extra command
  re-termination and re-sending of ABTS response.

- Add bits in driver and tracks CTIO/ATIO attribute bits for proper command
  Termination. A copy of the ATTR bits will be kept in the ABTS task
  management command as a back up copy, if an ABTS response encounters an
  error.
