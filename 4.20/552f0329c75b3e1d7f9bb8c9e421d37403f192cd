Btrfs: fix race between enabling quotas and subvolume creation

We have a race between enabling quotas end subvolume creation that cause
subvolume creation to fail with -EINVAL, and the following diagram shows
how it happens:

              CPU 0                                          CPU 1

 btrfs_ioctl()
  btrfs_ioctl_quota_ctl()
   btrfs_quota_enable()
    mutex_lock(fs_info->qgroup_ioctl_lock)

                                                  btrfs_ioctl()
                                                   create_subvol()
                                                    btrfs_qgroup_inherit()
                                                     -> save fs_info->quota_root
                                                        into quota_root
                                                     -> stores a NULL value
                                                     -> tries to lock the mutex
                                                        qgroup_ioctl_lock
                                                        -> blocks waiting for
                                                           the task at CPU0

   -> sets BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED in fs_info
   -> sets quota_root in fs_info->quota_root
      (non-NULL value)

   mutex_unlock(fs_info->qgroup_ioctl_lock)

                                                     -> checks quota enabled
                                                        flag is set
                                                     -> returns -EINVAL because
                                                        fs_info->quota_root was
                                                        NULL before it acquired
                                                        the mutex
                                                        qgroup_ioctl_lock
                                                   -> ioctl returns -EINVAL

Returning -EINVAL to user space will be confusing if all the arguments
passed to the subvolume creation ioctl were valid.

Fix it by grabbing the value from fs_info->quota_root after acquiring
the mutex.
