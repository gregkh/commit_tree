mm/memblock.c: warn if zero alignment was requested

After updating all memblock users to explicitly specify SMP_CACHE_BYTES
alignment rather than use 0, it is still possible that uncovered users may
sneak in.  Add a WARN_ON_ONCE for such cases.

[sfr@canb.auug.org.au: use dump_stack() instead of WARN_ON_ONCE for the alignment checks]
