blkcg: remove bio->bi_css and instead use bio->bi_blkg

Prior patches ensured that all bios are now associated with some blkg.
This now makes bio->bi_css unnecessary as blkg maintains a reference to
the blkcg already.

This patch removes the field bi_css and transfers corresponding uses to
access via bi_blkg.
