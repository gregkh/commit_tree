net: stmmac: dwmac-sun8i: fix OF child-node lookup

Use the new of_get_compatible_child() helper to lookup the mdio-internal
child node instead of using of_find_compatible_node(), which searches
the entire tree from a given start node and thus can return an unrelated
(i.e. non-child) node.

This also addresses a potential use-after-free (e.g. after probe
deferral) as the tree-wide helper drops a reference to its first
argument (i.e. the mdio-mux node). Fortunately, this was inadvertently
balanced by a failure to drop the mdio-mux reference after lookup.

While at it, also fix the related mdio-internal- and phy-node reference
leaks.
