s390/qeth: sanitize ARP requests

The ARP_{ADD,REMOVE}_ENTRY cmd structs contain reserved fields.
Introduce a common helper that doesn't raw-copy the user-provided data
into the cmd, but only sets those fields that are strictly needed for
the command.

This also sets the correct command length for ARP_REMOVE_ENTRY.
