mm/kasan/quarantine.c: make quarantine_lock a raw_spinlock_t

The static lock quarantine_lock is used in quarantine.c to protect the
quarantine queue datastructures.  It is taken inside quarantine queue
manipulation routines (quarantine_put(), quarantine_reduce() and
quarantine_remove_cache()), with IRQs disabled.  This is not a problem on
a stock kernel but is problematic on an RT kernel where spin locks are
sleeping spinlocks, which can sleep and can not be acquired with disabled
interrupts.

Convert the quarantine_lock to a raw spinlock_t.  The usage of
quarantine_lock is confined to quarantine.c and the work performed while
the lock is held is used for debug purpose.
