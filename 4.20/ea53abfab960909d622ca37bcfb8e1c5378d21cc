bonding/802.3ad: fix link_failure_count tracking

Commit 4d2c0cda07448ea6980f00102dc3964eb25e241c set slave->link to
BOND_LINK_DOWN for 802.3ad bonds whenever invalid speed/duplex values
were read, to fix a problem with slaves getting into weird states, but
in the process, broke tracking of link failures, as going straight to
BOND_LINK_DOWN when a link is indeed down (cable pulled, switch rebooted)
means we broke out of bond_miimon_inspect()'s BOND_LINK_DOWN case because
!link_state was already true, we never incremented commit, and never got
a chance to call bond_miimon_commit(), where slave->link_failure_count
would be incremented. I believe the simple fix here is to mark the slave
as BOND_LINK_FAIL, and let bond_miimon_inspect() transition the link from
_FAIL to either _UP or _DOWN, and in the latter case, we now get proper
incrementing of link_failure_count again.
