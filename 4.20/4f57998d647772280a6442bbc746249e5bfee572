clk: renesas: r8a77995: Correct RCLK handling

According to R-Car Gen3 Hardware Manual Rev.1.00, R-Car D3 has the
RCLK Frequency Control Register (RCKCR), which determines the OSC and
RINT predivider values, and selection of the RCLK clock source between
RINT and the On-Chip Oscillator.

Hence change the OSC and RINT clock definitions to use the RCKCR
divider, and add the missing On-Chip Oscillator and RCLK clock source
switching logic.
