iwlwifi: mvm: always init rs_fw with 20MHz bandwidth rates

As with the non-offloaded rs case, during assoc on the ap side the phy
context is set to 20MHz until authorization of a client that supports
wider channel-widths. Support this by sending the initial
tlc_config_cmd with max supported channel width of 20MHz until
authorization succeeds.
