net: aquantia: fix potential IOMMU fault after driver unbind

IOMMU fault may occurr on unbind/bind or if_down/if_up sequence.

Although driver disables the rings on down, this is not enough.
Due to internal HW design, during subsequent initialization
NIC sometimes may reuse RX descriptors cache and write to the
host memory from the descriptor cache.
That's get catched by IOMMU on host.

This patch invalidates the descriptor cache in NIC on interface down
to prevent writing to the cached descriptors and to the memory pointed
in those descriptors.
