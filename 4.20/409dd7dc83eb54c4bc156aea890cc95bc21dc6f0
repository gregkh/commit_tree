powerpc/papr_scm: Remove endian conversions

The return values of a h-call are returned in the CPU registers and
written to the provided buffer by the plpar_hcall() wrapper. As a result
the values written to memory are always in the native endian and should
not be byte swapped.

The inital implementation of the H-Call interface was done in qemu and
the returned values were byte swapped unnecessarily in both the
hypervisor and in the driver so this was only noticed when bringing up
the PowerVM implementation.
