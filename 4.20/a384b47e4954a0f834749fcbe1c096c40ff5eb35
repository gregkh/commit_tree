ubifs: Create functions to embed a HMAC in a node

With authentication support some nodes (master node, super block node)
get a HMAC embedded into them. This patch adds functions to prepare and
write such a node.
The difficulty is that besides the HMAC the nodes also have a CRC which
must stay valid. This means we first have to initialize all fields in
the node, then calculate the HMAC (not covering the CRC) and finally
calculate the CRC.
