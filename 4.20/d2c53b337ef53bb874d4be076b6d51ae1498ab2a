drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Fix 0-day build error

0day reports:

>> drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/ti-sn65dsi86.o: In function
mipi_dsi_detach'
>> drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/ti-sn65dsi86.c:630: undefined reference to
ti_sn_bridge_attach':
>> drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/ti-sn65dsi86.c:249: undefined reference to

>> drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/ti-sn65dsi86.c:276: undefined reference to
mipi_dsi_device_unregister'

Quite obviously the driver depends on DRM_MIPI_DSI.
We can not use depends since the driver configuration uses select,
so we'll have to select the missing dependency instead.
