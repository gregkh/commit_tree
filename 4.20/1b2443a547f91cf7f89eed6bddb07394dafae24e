powerpc/book3s64: Avoid multiple endian conversion in pte helpers

In the same spirit as already done in pte query helpers,
this patch changes pte setting helpers to perform endian
conversions on the constants rather than on the pte value.

In the meantime, it changes pte_access_permitted() to use
pte helpers for the same reason.
