scsi: qla4xxx: Remove redundant check on drvr_wait

The check for a non-zero drvr_wait is redundant as the same check is performed
earlier in the outer while loop, the inner check will always be true if we
reached this point inside the while loop.  Remove the redundant if check.

Detected by cppcheck:
(warning) Identical inner 'if' condition is always true.
