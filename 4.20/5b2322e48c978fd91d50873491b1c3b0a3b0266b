nvmet: Introduce helper functions to allocate and free request SGLs

Add helpers to allocate and free the SGL in a struct nvmet_req:

  int nvmet_req_alloc_sgl(struct nvmet_req *req)
  void nvmet_req_free_sgl(struct nvmet_req *req)

This will be expanded in a future patch to implement peer-to-peer memory
DMAs and should be common with all target drivers.

The new helpers are used in nvmet-rdma.  Seeing we use req.transfer_len as
the length of the SGL it is set earlier and cleared on any error.  It also
seems to be unnecessary to accumulate the length as the map_sgl functions
should only ever be called once per request.
