ARM: dts: qcom-msm8974: change invalid flag IRQ NONE to valid value

The following commits used IRQ_TYPE_NONE since that matched what was
already in the file and I do not have access to the datasheets for
these devices. After these patches were submitted, commit dcf145011400
("ARM: dts: qcom-msm8974: change invalid flag IRQ NONE to valid value")
changed all of these values to IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH. This patch corrects
the IRQ type for these two commits:

commit bd9392507588 ("ARM: dts: qcom: msm8974-hammerhead: add device
tree bindings for ALS / proximity")

commit fe8d81fe7d9a ("ARM: dts: qcom: msm8974-hammerhead: add device
tree bindings for mpu6515")

Prior to these patches, I was having issues with the bmp280 sensor
returning temperature / pressure skipped errors, however these errors
have gone away with these patches.

Patches were tested on a LG Nexus 5 (hammerhead) phone.
