cpufreq: ti-cpufreq: Only register platform_device when supported

Currently the ti-cpufreq driver blindly registers a 'ti-cpufreq' to force
the driver to probe on any platforms where the driver is built in.
However, this should only happen on platforms that actually can make use
of the driver. There is already functionality in place to match the
SoC compatible so let's factor this out into a separate call and
make sure we find a match before creating the ti-cpufreq platform device.
