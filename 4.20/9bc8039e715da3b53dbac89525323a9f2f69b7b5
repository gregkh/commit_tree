mm: brk: downgrade mmap_sem to read when shrinking

brk might be used to shrink memory mapping too other than munmap().  So,
it may hold write mmap_sem for long time when shrinking large mapping, as
what commit ("mm: mmap: zap pages with read mmap_sem in munmap")
described.

The brk() will not manipulate vmas anymore after __do_munmap() call for
the mapping shrink use case.  But, it may set mm->brk after __do_munmap(),
which needs hold write mmap_sem.

However, a simple trick can workaround this by setting mm->brk before
__do_munmap().  Then restore the original value if __do_munmap() fails.
With this trick, it is safe to downgrade to read mmap_sem.

So, the same optimization, which downgrades mmap_sem to read for zapping
pages, is also feasible and reasonable to this case.

The period of holding exclusive mmap_sem for shrinking large mapping would
be reduced significantly with this optimization.
