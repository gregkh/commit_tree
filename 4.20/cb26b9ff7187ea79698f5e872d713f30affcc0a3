s390/pkey: Introduce new API for random protected key verification

Introduce a new ioctl API and in-kernel API to verify if a
random protected key is still valid. A protected key is
invalid when its wrapping key verification pattern does not
match the verification pattern of the LPAR. Each time an LPAR
is activated, a new LPAR wrapping key is generated and the
wrapping key verification pattern is updated.
Both APIs are described in detail in the header files
arch/s390/include/asm/pkey.h and arch/s390/include/uapi/asm/pkey.h.
