nvmem: remove the global cell list

Nvmem subsystem keeps a global list of cells that, for non-DT systems,
can only be referenced by cell name, which makes it impossible to have
more than one nvmem device with cells named the same.

This patch makes every nvmem device the owner of the list of its cells.
This effectively removes the support for non-DT systems, but it will
be reintroduced following a different approach in subsequent patches.

This isn't a problem as support for board files in nvmem is currently
broken anyway: any user that would try to get an nvmem cell from the
global cell list would remove the cell after the calling
nvmem_cell_put(). This can cause anything from a subsequent user not
being able to get the cell to double free errors if more users hold
reference to the same cell at the same time.

Fortunately there are no such users which allows us to rework this part.
