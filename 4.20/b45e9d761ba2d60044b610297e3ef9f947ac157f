powerpc/pseries/memory-hotplug: Fix return value type of find_aa_index

The variable 'aa_index' is defined as an unsigned value in
update_lmb_associativity_index(), but find_aa_index() may return -1
when dlpar_clone_property() fails. So change find_aa_index() to return
a bool, which indicates whether 'aa_index' was found or not.
