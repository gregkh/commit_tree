nvme: update node paths after adding new path

The nvme namespace paths were being updated only when the current path
was not set or nonoptimized. If a new path comes online that is a better
path for its NUMA node, the multipath selector may continue using the
previously set path on a potentially further node.

This patch re-runs the path assignment after successfully adding a new
optimized path.
