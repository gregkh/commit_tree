media: pxa_camera: Fix check for pdev->dev.of_node

Clang warns that the address of a pointer will always evaluated as true
in a boolean context.

drivers/media/platform/pxa_camera.c:2400:17: warning: address of
'pdev->dev.of_node' will always evaluate to 'true'
[-Wpointer-bool-conversion]
        if (&pdev->dev.of_node && !pcdev->pdata) {
             ~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~ ~~
1 warning generated.

Judging from the rest of the kernel, it seems like this was an error and
just the value of of_node should be checked rather than the address.
