EDAC, skx_edac: Add address translation for non-volatile DIMMs

Currently, this driver doesn't support address translation for
non-volatile DIMMs.

The ACPI ADXL DSM method provides address translation for both volatile
and non-volatile DIMMs. Enable it to use the ACPI DSM methods if they
are supported and there are non-volatile DIMMs populated on the system.
