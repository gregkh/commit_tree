lightnvm: pblk: remove debug from pblk_[down/up]_page

Remove the debug only iteration within __pblk_down_page, which
then allows us to reduce the number of arguments down to pblk and
the parallel unit from the functions that calls it. Simplifying the
callers logic considerably.

Also, rename the functions pblk_[down/up]_page to
pblk_[down/up]_chunk, to communicate that it manages the write
pointer of the chunk. Note that it also protects the parallel unit
such that at most one chunk is active per parallel unit.
