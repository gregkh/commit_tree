drm/sun4i: tcon: Add dithering support for RGB565/RGB666 LCD panels

The hardware supports dithering on TCON channel 0 which is used for LCD
panels.

Dithering is a method of approximating a color from a mixture of other
colors when the required color isn't available. It reduces color
banding artifacts that can be observed when displaying gradients
(e.g. grayscale gradients). This may occur when the image that needs
to be displayed is 24-bit but the LCD panel is a lower bit depth and
does not perform dithering on its own.
