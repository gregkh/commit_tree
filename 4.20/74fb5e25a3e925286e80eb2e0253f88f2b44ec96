net: phy: improve handling of PHY_RUNNING in state machine

Handling of state PHY_RUNNING seems to be more complex than it needs
to be. If not polling, then we don't have to do anything, we'll
receive an interrupt and go to state PHY_CHANGELINK once the link
goes down. If polling and link is down, we don't have to go the
extra mile over PHY_CHANGELINK and call phy_read_status() again
but can set status PHY_NOLINK directly.
