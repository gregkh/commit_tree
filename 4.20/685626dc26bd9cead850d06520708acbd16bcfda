tools include uapi: Update linux/mmap.h copy

To pick up the changes from:

  20916d4636a9 ("mm/hugetlb: add mmap() encodings for 32MB and 512MB page sizes")

That do not entail changes in in tools, this just shows that we have to
consider bits [26:31] of flags to beautify that in tools like 'perf
trace'

This silences this perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/include/uapi/linux/mman.h' differs from latest version at 'include/uapi/linux/mman.h'
  diff -u tools/include/uapi/linux/mman.h include/uapi/linux/mman.h
