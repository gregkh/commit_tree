spi: omap2-mcspi: Add missing suspend and resume calls

I've been wondering still about omap2-mcspi related suspend and resume
flakeyness and looks like we're missing calls to spi_master_suspend()
and spi_master_resume(). Adding those and using pm_runtime_force_suspend()
and pm_runtime_force_resume() makes things work for suspend and resume
and allows us to stop using noirq suspend and resume.

And while at it, let's use SET_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS to simplify things
further.
