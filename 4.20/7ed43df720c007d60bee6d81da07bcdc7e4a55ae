drm/i915: Restore sane defaults for KMS on GEM error load

If we fail during GEM initialisation, we scrub the HW state by
performing a device level GPU resuet. However, we want to leave the
system in a usable state (with functioning KMS but no GEM) so after
scrubbing the HW state, we need to restore some sane defaults and
re-enable the low-level common parts of the GPU (such as the GMCH).

v2: Restore GTT entries.
