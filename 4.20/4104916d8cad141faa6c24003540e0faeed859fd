platform/x86: touchscreen_dmi: Add min-x and min-y settings for various models

Add min-x and min-y settings now that we've support for this and for some
models also update the width/height settings with slighly more accurate
values.

This fixes touches along the edges registering at the wrong coordinates.

While at it also set max-fingers to 10 in a couple of cases where the
touchpad can handle 10 fingers (rather then the default 5) and that was
missing.
