btrfs: dev-replace: move replace members out of fs_info

The replace_wait and bio_counter were mistakenly added to fs_info in
commit c404e0dc2c843b154f ("Btrfs: fix use-after-free in the finishing
procedure of the device replace"), but they logically belong to
fs_info::dev_replace. Besides, bio_counter is a very generic name and is
confusing in bare fs_info context.
