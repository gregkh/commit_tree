selftests/seccomp: Remove SIGSTOP si_pid check

Commit f149b3155744 ("signal: Never allocate siginfo for SIGKILL or SIGSTOP")
means that the seccomp selftest cannot check si_pid under SIGSTOP anymore.
Since it's believed[1] there are no other userspace things depending on the
old behavior, this removes the behavioral check in the selftest, since it's
more a "extra" sanity check (which turns out, maybe, not to have been
useful to test).
