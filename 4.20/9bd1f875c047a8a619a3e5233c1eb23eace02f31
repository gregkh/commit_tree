lightnvm: pblk: move ring buffer alloc/free rb init

pblk's read/write buffer currently takes a buffer and its size and uses
it to create the metadata around it to use it as a ring buffer. This
puts the responsibility of allocating/freeing ring buffer memory on the
ring buffer user. Instead, move it inside of the ring buffer helpers
(pblk-rb.c). This simplifies creation/destruction routines.
