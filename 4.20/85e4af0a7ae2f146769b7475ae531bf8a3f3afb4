media: rc: ir-rc6-decoder: enable toggle bit for Kathrein RCU-676 remote

The Kathrein RCU-676 remote uses the 32-bit rc6 protocol and toggles
bit 15 (0x8000) on repeated button presses, like MCE remotes.

Add it's customer code 0x80460000 to the 32-bit rc6 toggle
handling code to get proper scancodes and toggle reports.
