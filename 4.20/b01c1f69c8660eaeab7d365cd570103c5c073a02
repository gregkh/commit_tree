perf tools: Restore proper cwd on return from mnt namespace

When reporting on 'record' server we try to retrieve/use the mnt
namespace of the profiled tasks. We use following API with cookie to
hold the return namespace, roughly:

  nsinfo__mountns_enter(struct nsinfo *nsi, struct nscookie *nc)
    setns(newns, 0);
  ...
  new ns related open..
  ...
  nsinfo__mountns_exit(struct nscookie *nc)
    setns(nc->oldns)

Once finished we setns to old namespace, which also sets the current
working directory (cwd) to "/", trashing the cwd we had.

This is mostly fine, because we use absolute paths almost everywhere,
but it screws up 'perf diff':

  # perf diff
  failed to open perf.data: No such file or directory  (try 'perf record' first)
  ...

Adding the current working directory to be part of the cookie and
restoring it in the nsinfo__mountns_exit call.
