locking/qspinlock_stat: Count instances of nested lock slowpaths

Queued spinlock supports up to 4 levels of lock slowpath nesting -
user context, soft IRQ, hard IRQ and NMI. However, we are not sure how
often the nesting happens.

So add 3 more per-CPU stat counters to track the number of instances where
nesting index goes to 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

On a dual-socket 64-core 128-thread Zen server, the following were the
new stat counter values under different circumstances:

         State                         slowpath   index1   index2   index3
         -----                         --------   ------   ------   -------
  After bootup                         1,012,150    82       0        0
  After parallel build + perf-top    125,195,009    82       0        0

So the chance of having more than 2 levels of nesting is extremely low.
