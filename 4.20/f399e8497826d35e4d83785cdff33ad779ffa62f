bnxt_en: Use msix_vec_per_pf_max and msix_vec_per_pf_min devlink params.

This patch adds support for following generic permanent mode
devlink parameters. They can be modified using devlink param
commands.

msix_vec_per_pf_max - This param sets the number of MSIX vectors
that the device requests from the host on driver initialization.
This value is set in the device which limits MSIX vectors per PF.

msix_vec_per_pf_min - This param sets the number of minimal MSIX
vectors required for the device initialization. Value 0 indicates
a default value is selected. This value is set in the device which
limits MSIX vectors per PF.
