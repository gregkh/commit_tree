drm/omap: Store CRTC lookup by channel table in omap_drm_private

The omap_crtcs global array is used to store pointers to omap_crtc
indexed by DISPC channel number, in order to look them up in the dss_mgr
operations. Store the information in the omap_drm_private structure in
the form of an array of omap_drm_pipeline pointers.
