vmw_balloon: change batch/single lock abstractions

The current abstractions for batch vs single operations seem suboptimal
and complicate the implementation of additional features (OOM,
compaction).

The immediate problem of the current abstractions is that they cause
differences in how operations are handled when batching is on or off.
For example, the refused_alloc counter is not updated when batching is
on. These discrepancies are caused by code redundancies.

Instead, this patch presents three type of operations, according to
whether batching is on or off: (1) add page, (2) communication with the
hypervisor and (3) retrieving the status of a page.

To avoid the overhead of virtual functions, and since we do not expect
additional interfaces for communication with the hypervisor, we use
static keys instead of virtual functions.

Finally, while we are at it, change vmballoon_init_batching() to return
int instead of bool, to be consistent in the return type and avoid
potential coding errors.
