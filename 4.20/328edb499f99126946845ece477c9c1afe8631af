net/mlx5: Split FDB fast path prio to multiple namespaces

Towards supporting multi-chains and priorities, split the FDB fast path
to multiple namespaces (sub namespaces), each with multiple priorities.

This patch adds a new flow steering type, FS_TYPE_PRIO_CHAINS, which is
like current FS_TYPE_PRIO, but may contain only namespaces, and those
will be in parallel to one another in terms of managing of the flow
tables connections inside them. Meaning, while searching for the next
or previous flow table to connect for a new table inside such namespace
we skip the parallel namespaces in the same level under the
FS_TYPE_PRIO_CHAINS prio we originated from.

We use this new type for splitting the fast path prio into multiple
parallel namespaces, each containing normal prios.
The prios inside them (and their tables) will be connected to one
another, but not from one parallel namespace to another, instead the
last prio in each namespace will be connected to the next prio in
the containing FDB namespace, which is the slow path prio.
