signal: Introduce COMPAT_SIGMINSTKSZ for use in compat_sys_sigaltstack

The sigaltstack(2) system call fails with -ENOMEM if the new alternative
signal stack is found to be smaller than SIGMINSTKSZ. On architectures
such as arm64, where the native value for SIGMINSTKSZ is larger than
the compat value, this can result in an unexpected error being reported
to a compat task. See, for example:

  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=904385

This patch fixes the problem by extending do_sigaltstack to take the
minimum signal stack size as an additional parameter, allowing the
native and compat system call entry code to pass in their respective
values. COMPAT_SIGMINSTKSZ is just defined as SIGMINSTKSZ if it has not
been defined by the architecture.
