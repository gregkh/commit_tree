rcu: Remove rsp parameter from expedited grace-period functions

There now is only one rcu_state structure in a given build of the
Linux kernel, so there is no need to pass it as a parameter to
RCU's functions.  This commit therefore removes the rsp parameter
from the code in kernel/rcu/tree_exp.h, and removes all of the
rsp local variables while in the area.
