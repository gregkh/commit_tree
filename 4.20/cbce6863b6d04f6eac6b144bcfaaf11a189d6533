md-cluster/bitmap: don't call md_bitmap_sync_with_cluster during reshaping stage

When reshape is happening in one node, other nodes could receive
lots of RESYNCING messages, so md_bitmap_sync_with_cluster is called.

Since the resyncing window is typically small in these RESYNCING
messages, so WARN is always triggered, so we should not call the
func when reshape is happening.
