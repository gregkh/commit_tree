drm/i915/execlists: Flush tasklet directly from reset-finish

On finishing the reset, the intention is to restart the GPU before we
relinquish the forcewake taken to handle the reset - the goal being the
GPU reloads a context before it is allowed to sleep. For this purpose,
we used tasklet_flush() which although it accomplished the goal of
restarting the GPU, carried with it a sting in its tail: it cleared the
TASKLET_STATE_SCHED bit. This meant that if another CPU queued a new
request to this engine, we would clear the flag and later attempt to
requeue the tasklet on the local CPU, breaking the per-cpu softirq
lists.

Remove the dangerous tasklet_kill() and just run the tasklet func
directly as we know it is safe to do so (the tasklets are internally
locked to allow mixed usage from direct submission).
