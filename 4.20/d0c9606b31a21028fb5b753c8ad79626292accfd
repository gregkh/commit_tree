PCI: Add Device IDs for Intel GPU "spurious interrupt" quirk

Add Device IDs to the Intel GPU "spurious interrupt" quirk table.

For these devices, unplugging the VGA cable and plugging it in again causes
spurious interrupts from the IGD.  Linux eventually disables the interrupt,
but of course that disables any other devices sharing the interrupt.

The theory is that this is a VGA BIOS defect: it should have disabled the
IGD interrupt but failed to do so.

See f67fd55fa96f ("PCI: Add quirk for still enabled interrupts on Intel
Sandy Bridge GPUs") and 7c82126a94e6 ("PCI: Add new ID for Intel GPU
"spurious interrupt" quirk") for some history.

[bhelgaas: See link below for discussion about how to fix this more
generically instead of adding device IDs for every new Intel GPU.  I hope
this is the last patch to add device IDs.]
