- added missing calls to the panel,
- custom OF graph code replaced with helpers,
- removed tc358764_poweroff from remove callback.
v5:

- fixed broken console - added connector to fb_helper,
- added detach callback - unbinding works,
- fixed typo in error checking code,
- removed sparse bridge->encoder check - core does it already.
