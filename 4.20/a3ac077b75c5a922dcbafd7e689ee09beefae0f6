KVM: PPC: Remove redundand permission bits removal

The kvmppc_gpa_to_ua() helper itself takes care of the permission
bits in the TCE and yet every single caller removes them.

This changes semantics of kvmppc_gpa_to_ua() so it takes TCEs
(which are GPAs + TCE permission bits) to make the callers simpler.

This should cause no behavioural change.
