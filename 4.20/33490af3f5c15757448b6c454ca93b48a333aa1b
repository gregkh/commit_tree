mm, mmu_notifier: be explicit about range invalition non-blocking mode

If invalidate_range_start() is called for !blocking mode then all
callbacks have to guarantee they will no block/sleep.  The same obviously
applies to invalidate_range_end because this operation pairs with the
former and they are called from the same context.  Make sure this is
appropriately documented.
