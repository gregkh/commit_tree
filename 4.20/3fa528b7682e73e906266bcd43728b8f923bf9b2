net: phy: mscc: fix deadlock in vsc85xx_default_config

The vsc85xx_default_config function called in the vsc85xx_config_init
function which is used by VSC8530, VSC8531, VSC8540 and VSC8541 PHYs
mistakenly calls phy_read and phy_write in-between phy_select_page and
phy_restore_page.

phy_select_page and phy_restore_page actually take and release the MDIO
bus lock and phy_write and phy_read take and release the lock to write
or read to a PHY register.

Let's fix this deadlock by using phy_modify_paged which handles
correctly a read followed by a write in a non-standard page.
