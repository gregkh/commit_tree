IB/umem: Set correct address to the invalidation function

The invalidate range was using PAGE_SIZE instead of the computed 'end',
and had the wrong transformation of page_index due the weird
construction. This can trigger during error unwind and would cause
malfunction.

Inline the code and correct the math.
