tun: switch to new type of msg_control

This patch introduces to a new tun/tap specific msg_control:

#define TUN_MSG_UBUF 1
#define TUN_MSG_PTR  2
struct tun_msg_ctl {
       int type;
       void *ptr;
};

This allows us to pass different kinds of msg_control through
sendmsg(). The first supported type is ubuf (TUN_MSG_UBUF) which will
be used by the existed vhost_net zerocopy code. The second is XDP
buff, which allows vhost_net to pass XDP buff to TUN. This could be
used to implement accepting an array of XDP buffs from vhost_net in
the following patches.
