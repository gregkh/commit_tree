md/raid10: Fix raid10 replace hang when new added disk faulty

[Symptom]

Resync thread hang when new added disk faulty during replacing.

[Root Cause]

In raid10_sync_request(), we expect to issue a bio with callback
end_sync_read(), and a bio with callback end_sync_write().

In normal situation, we will add resyncing sectors into
mddev->recovery_active when raid10_sync_request() returned, and sub
resynced sectors from mddev->recovery_active when end_sync_write()
calls end_sync_request().

If new added disk, which are replacing the old disk, is set faulty,
there is a race condition:
    1. In the first rcu protected section, resync thread did not detect
       that mreplace is set faulty and pass the condition.
    2. In the second rcu protected section, mreplace is set faulty.
    3. But, resync thread will prepare the read object first, and then
       check the write condition.
    4. It will find that mreplace is set faulty and do not have to
       prepare write object.
This cause we add resync sectors but never sub it.

[How to Reproduce]

This issue can be easily reproduced by the following steps:
    mdadm -C /dev/md0 --assume-clean -l 10 -n 4 /dev/sd[abcd]
    mdadm /dev/md0 -a /dev/sde
    mdadm /dev/md0 --replace /dev/sdd
    sleep 1
    mdadm /dev/md0 -f /dev/sde

[How to Fix]

This issue can be fixed by using local variables to record the result
of test conditions. Once the conditions are satisfied, we can make sure
that we need to issue a bio for read and a bio for write.

Previous 'commit 24afd80d99f8 ("md/raid10: handle recovery of
replacement devices.")' will also check whether bio is NULL, but leave
the comment saying that it is a pointless test. So we remove this dummy
check.
