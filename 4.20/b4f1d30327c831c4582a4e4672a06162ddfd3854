net: hns3: Fix tqp array traversal condition for vf

There are two tqp_num variables "hdev->tqp_num" and "kinfo->tqp_num"
used in VF. "hdev->tqp_num" is the total tqp number allocated to the
VF, and "kinfo->tqp_num" indicates the tqp number being used by the
VF. Usually the two variables are equal. But for the case hdev->tqp_num
larger than rss_size_max, and num_tc is 1, "kinfo->tqp_num" will be
less than "hdev->tqp_num".

In original codes, "hdev->tqp_num" is always used to traverse the
tqp array of kinfo. It may cause null pointer error when "hdev->tqp_num"
is larger than "kinfo->tqp_num"
