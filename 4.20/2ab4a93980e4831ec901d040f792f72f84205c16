gpio: vr41xx: Delete vr41xx_gpio_pullupdown() callback

This API is not used anywhere in the kernel and has remained
unused for years after being introduced.

Over time, we have developed a subsystem to deal with pin
control and this now managed pull up/down.

Delete the old and unused API. If this platform needs it,
we should implement a proper pin controller for it instead.
