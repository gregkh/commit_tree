net: sched: cls_u32: disallow linking to root hnode

Operation makes no sense.  Nothing will actually break if we do so
(depth limit in u32_classify() will prevent infinite loops), but
according to maintainers it's best prohibited outright.

NOTE: doing so guarantees that u32_destroy() will trigger the call
of u32_destroy_hnode(); we might want to make that unconditional.

Test:
tc qdisc add dev eth0 ingress
tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: protocol ip prio 100 u32 \
link 800: offset at 0 mask 0f00 shift 6 plus 0 eat match ip protocol 6 ff
should fail with
Error: cls_u32: Not linking to root node
