tls: Remove redundant vars from tls record structure

Structure 'tls_rec' contains sg_aead_in and sg_aead_out which point
to a aad_space and then chain scatterlists sg_plaintext_data,
sg_encrypted_data respectively. Rather than using chained scatterlists
for plaintext and encrypted data in aead_req, it is efficient to store
aad_space in sg_encrypted_data and sg_plaintext_data itself in the
first index and get rid of sg_aead_in, sg_aead_in and further chaining.

This requires increasing size of sg_encrypted_data & sg_plaintext_data
arrarys by 1 to accommodate entry for aad_space. The code which uses
sg_encrypted_data and sg_plaintext_data has been modified to skip first
index as it points to aad_space.
