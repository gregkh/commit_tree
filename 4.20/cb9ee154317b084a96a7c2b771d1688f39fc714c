md-cluster: send BITMAP_NEEDS_SYNC message if reshaping is interrupted

We need to continue the reshaping if it was interrupted in
original node. So original node should call resync_bitmap
in case reshaping is aborted.

Then BITMAP_NEEDS_SYNC message is broadcasted to other nodes,
node which continues the reshaping should restart reshape from
mddev->reshape_position instead of from the first beginning.
