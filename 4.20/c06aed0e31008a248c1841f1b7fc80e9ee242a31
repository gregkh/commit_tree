rcu: Compute jiffies_till_sched_qs from other kernel parameters

The jiffies_till_sched_qs value used to determine how old a grace period
must be before RCU enlists the help of the scheduler to force a quiescent
state on the holdout CPU.  Currently, this defaults to HZ/10 regardless of
system size and may be set only at boot time.  This can be a problem for
very large systems, because if the values of the jiffies_till_first_fqs
and jiffies_till_next_fqs kernel parameters are left at their defaults,
they are calculated to increase as the number of CPUs actually configured
on the system increases.  Thus, on a sufficiently large system, RCU would
enlist the help of the scheduler before the grace-period kthread had a
chance to scan for idle CPUs, which wastes CPU time.

This commit therefore allows jiffies_till_sched_qs to be set, if desired,
but if left as default, computes is as jiffies_till_first_fqs plus twice
jiffies_till_next_fqs, thus allowing three force-quiescent-state scans
for idle CPUs.  This scales with the number of CPUs, providing sensible
default values.
