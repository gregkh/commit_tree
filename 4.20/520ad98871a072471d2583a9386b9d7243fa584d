arm64/cpufeatures: Factorize emulate_mrs()

MRS emulation gets triggered with exception class (0x00 or 0x18) eventually
calling the function emulate_mrs() which fetches the user space instruction
and analyses it's encodings (OP0, OP1, OP2, CRN, CRM, RT). The kernel tries
to emulate the given instruction looking into the encoding details. Going
forward these encodings can also be parsed from ESR_ELx.ISS fields without
requiring to fetch/decode faulting userspace instruction which can improve
performance. This factorizes emulate_mrs() function in a way that it can be
called directly with MRS encodings (OP0, OP1, OP2, CRN, CRM) for any given
target register which can then be used directly from 0x18 exception class.
