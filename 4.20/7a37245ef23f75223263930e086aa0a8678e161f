octeontx2-af: NPA block admin queue init

Initialize NPA admin queue (AQ) i.e alloc memory for
AQ instructions and for the results. All NPA LFs will submit
instructions to AQ to init/write/read Aura/Pool contexts
and in case of read, get context from result memory.

Added some common APIs for allocating memory for a queue
and get IOVA in return, these APIs will be used by
NIX AQ and for other purposes.
