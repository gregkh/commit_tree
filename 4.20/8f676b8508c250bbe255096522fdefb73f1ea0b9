nvme: make sure ns head inherits underlying device limits

Whenever we update ns_head info, we need to make sure it is still
compatible with all underlying backing devices because although nvme
multipath doesn't have any explicit use of these limits, other devices
can still be stacked on top of it which may rely on the underlying limits.
Start with unlimited stacking limits, and every info update iterate over
siblings and adjust queue limits.
