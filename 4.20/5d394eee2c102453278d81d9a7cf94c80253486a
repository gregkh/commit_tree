libnvdimm, region: Fail badblocks listing for inactive regions

While experimenting with region driver loading the following backtrace
was triggered:

 INFO: trying to register non-static key.
 the code is fine but needs lockdep annotation.
 turning off the locking correctness validator.
 [..]
 Call Trace:
  dump_stack+0x85/0xcb

  badblocks_show+0x70/0x190
  ? dev_attr_show+0x1c/0x50
  dev_attr_show+0x1c/0x50

This results from a missing successful call to devm_init_badblocks()
from nd_region_probe(). Block attempts to show badblocks while the
region is not enabled.
