drm/sun4i: Use __drm_atomic_helper_plane_reset instead of copying the logic

A new helper function(__drm_atomic_helper_plane_reset) has been added
for linking a plane with its state and resetting the core
properties(alpha, rotation, etc.) to their default values.
Use that instead of duplicating the logic.

__drm_atomic_helper_plane_reset initializes the alpha property to its
max value, which is defined by the drm core as DRM_BLEND_ALPHA_OPAQUE,
so nothing changes regarding the alpha value.
