KVM: nVMX: add KVM_CAP_HYPERV_ENLIGHTENED_VMCS capability

Enlightened VMCS is opt-in. The current version does not contain all
fields supported by nested VMX so we must not advertise the
corresponding VMX features if enlightened VMCS is enabled.

Userspace is given the enlightened VMCS version supported by KVM as
part of enabling KVM_CAP_HYPERV_ENLIGHTENED_VMCS. The version is to
be advertised to the nested hypervisor, currently done via a cpuid
leaf for Hyper-V.
