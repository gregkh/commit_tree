KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Framework and hcall stubs for nested virtualization

This starts the process of adding the code to support nested HV-style
virtualization.  It defines a new H_SET_PARTITION_TABLE hypercall which
a nested hypervisor can use to set the base address and size of a
partition table in its memory (analogous to the PTCR register).
On the host (level 0 hypervisor) side, the H_SET_PARTITION_TABLE
hypercall from the guest is handled by code that saves the virtual
PTCR value for the guest.

This also adds code for creating and destroying nested guests and for
reading the partition table entry for a nested guest from L1 memory.
Each nested guest has its own shadow LPID value, different in general
from the LPID value used by the nested hypervisor to refer to it.  The
shadow LPID value is allocated at nested guest creation time.

Nested hypervisor functionality is only available for a radix guest,
which therefore means a radix host on a POWER9 (or later) processor.
