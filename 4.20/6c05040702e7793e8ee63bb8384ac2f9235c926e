btrfs: Make btrfs_find_device_missing_or_by_path return directly a device

This function returns a numeric error value and additionally the
device found in one of its input parameters. Simplify this by making
the function directly return a pointer to btrfs_device. Additionally
adjust the caller to handle the case when we want to remove the
'missing' device and ENOENT is returned to return the expected
positive error value, parsed by progs. Finally, unexport the function
since it's not called outside of volume.c. No functional changes.
