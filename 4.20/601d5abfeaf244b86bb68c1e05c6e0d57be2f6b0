Looking at the kernel code the historical behavior has alwasy been to prefer
the signal number passed in by the kernel.

So sigh.  Implmenet __copy_siginfo_from_user and __copy_siginfo_from_user32 to
take that signal number and prefer it.  The user of ptrace will still
use copy_siginfo_from_user and copy_siginfo_from_user32 as they do not and
never have had a signal number there.

Luckily this change has never made it farther than linux-next.
