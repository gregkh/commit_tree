OPP: Create separate kref for static OPPs list

The static OPPs don't always get freed with the OPP table, it can happen
before that as well. For example, if the OPP table is first created
using helpers like dev_pm_opp_set_supported_hw() and the OPPs are
created at a later point. Now when the OPPs are removed, the OPP table
stays until the time dev_pm_opp_put_supported_hw() is called.

Later patches will streamline the freeing of OPP table and that requires
the static OPPs to get freed with help of a separate kernel reference.
This patch prepares for that by creating a separate kref for static OPPs
list.
