scsi: core: Remove scsi_block_when_processing_errors: message

This message floods the log when enabling mask 0x7 for
/proc/sys/dev/scsi/logging_level:

 xxxxxxxx kernel: scsi_block_when_processing_errors: rtn: 1

It's not needed and makes tracing just scsi_eh* messages way too
verbose so get rid of it.

[mkp: mangled patch, applied by hand]
