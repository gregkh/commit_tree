net: xsk: add a simple buffer reuse queue

XSK UMEM is strongly single producer single consumer so reuse of
frames is challenging.  Add a simple "stash" of FILL packets to
reuse for drivers to optionally make use of.  This is useful
when driver has to free (ndo_stop) or resize a ring with an active
AF_XDP ZC socket.
