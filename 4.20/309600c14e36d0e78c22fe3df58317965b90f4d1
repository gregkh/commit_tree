mtd: rawnand: Allow selection of ECC byte ordering at runtime

Currently, the selection of ECC byte ordering for software hamming is
done at compilation time, which doesn't make sense when ECC byte
calculation is done in hardware and byte ordering is forced by the
hardware engine.
In this case, only the correction is done in software and we want to
force the byte-ordering no matter the value of CONFIG_MTD_NAND_ECC_SMC.

This is typically the case for the FSMC (Smart Media ordering), TMIO and
TXX9NDFMC (regular byte ordering) blocks.

For all other use cases (pure software implementation, SM FTL and
nandecctest), we keep selecting the byte ordering based on the
CONFIG_MTD_NAND_ECC_SMC value. It might not be ideal for SM FTL (I'd
expect Smart Media ordering to be employed by the Smart Media FTL), but
this option doesn't seem to be enabled in the existing _defconfig, so
I can't tell setting sm_order to true is the right choice.
