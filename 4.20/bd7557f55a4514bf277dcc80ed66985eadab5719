thermal: tsens: Prepare 8916 and 8974 tsens to use SROT and TM address space

We've already converted over the devicetree of platforms using v2
version of the TSENS IP to use two address spaces. Now prepare to
convert over the 8916 and 8974 platforms to use separate SROT and TM
address spaces.

This patch will work with device trees with one or two address spaces
because we set the tm_offset in commit 5b1283984fa3 ("thermal: tsens:
Add support to split up register address space into two").
