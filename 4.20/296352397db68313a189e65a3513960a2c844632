s390/kasan: avoid kasan crash with standby memory defined

Kasan early memory allocator simply chops off memory blocks from the
end of the physical memory. Reuse mem_detect info to identify actual
online memory end rather than using max_physmem_end. This allows to run
the kernel with kasan enabled and standby memory defined.
