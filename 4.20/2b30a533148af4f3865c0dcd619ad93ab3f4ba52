fuse: add locking to max_background and congestion_threshold changes

Functions sequences like request_end()->flush_bg_queue() require that
max_background and congestion_threshold are constant during their
execution. Otherwise, checks like

	if (fc->num_background == fc->max_background)

made in different time may behave not like expected.
