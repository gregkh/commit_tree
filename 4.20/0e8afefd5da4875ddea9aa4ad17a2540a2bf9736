drm: panel-orientation-quirks: Add quirk for Acer One 10 (S1003)

The Acer One 10 uses a clamshell design with a detachable keyboard.
As such in normal operating mode, with the keyboard attach the device
is in landscape mode (and the Acer logo at boot also shows in landscape
mode).

But the device uses a portrait screen rotated 90 degrees (sigh). This
commit adds a quirk for this device so that we shown the fbcon the
right way up and that we hint userspace to also show e.g. plymouth and
gdm the right way up.
