lib/bitmap.c: remove wrong documentation

This promise is violated in a number of places, e.g.  already in the
second function below this paragraph.  Since I don't think anybody relies
on this being true, and since actually honouring it would hurt performance
and code size in various places, just remove the paragraph.
