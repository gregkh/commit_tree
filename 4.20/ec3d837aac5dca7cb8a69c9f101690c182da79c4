net/flow_dissector: correctly cap nhoff and thoff in case of BPF

We want to make sure that the following condition holds:
0 <= nhoff <= thoff <= skb->len

BPF program can set out-of-bounds nhoff and thoff, which is dangerous, see
recent commit d0c081b49137 ("flow_dissector: properly cap thoff field")'.
