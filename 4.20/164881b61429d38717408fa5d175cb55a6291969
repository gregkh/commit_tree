signal/x86/traps: Simplify trap generation

Update the DO_ERROR macro to take si_code and si_addr values for a siginfo,
removing the need for the fill_trap_info function.

Update do_trap to also take the sicode and si_addr values for a sigininfo
and modify the code to call force_sig when a sicode is not passed in
and to call force_sig_fault when all of the information is present.

Making this a more obvious, simpler and less error prone construction.
