signal: Always deliver the kernel's SIGKILL and SIGSTOP to a pid namespace init

Instead of playing whack-a-mole and changing SEND_SIG_PRIV to
SEND_SIG_FORCED throughout the kernel to ensure a pid namespace init
gets signals sent by the kernel, stop allowing a pid namespace init to
ignore SIGKILL or SIGSTOP sent by the kernel.  A pid namespace init is
only supposed to be able to ignore signals sent from itself and
children with SIG_DFL.
