net/kconfig: Make QCOM_QMI_HELPERS available when COMPILE_TEST

The networking merge brought in the experimental support for the
Qualcomm ath10k system NOC, which selects QCOM_QMI_HELPERS as a
dependency.

But the ATH10K_SNOC option (which selects QCOM_QMI_HELPERS) depends on
ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST in order to get wider build testing than just
the unusual QCOM architecture build, while the QCOM_QMI_HELPERS option
doesn't have that COMPILE_TEST option and is limited to only ARCH_QCOM.

As a result, a "make allmodconfig" complains

  WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for QCOM_QMI_HELPERS
    Depends on [n]: ARCH_QCOM && NET [=y]
    Selected by [m]:
    - ATH10K_SNOC [=m] && NETDEVICES [=y] && WLAN [=y] && WLAN_VENDOR_ATH [=y] && ATH10K [=m] && (ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST [=y])

Fix the config-time warning by making QCOM_QMI_HELPERS available when
COMPILE_TEST, since the result seems to build fine.
