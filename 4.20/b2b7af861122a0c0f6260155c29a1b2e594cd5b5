tcp: fix NULL ref in tail loss probe

TCP loss probe timer may fire when the retranmission queue is empty but
has a non-zero tp->packets_out counter. tcp_send_loss_probe will call
tcp_rearm_rto which triggers NULL pointer reference by fetching the
retranmission queue head in its sub-routines.

Add a more detailed warning to help catch the root cause of the inflight
accounting inconsistency.
