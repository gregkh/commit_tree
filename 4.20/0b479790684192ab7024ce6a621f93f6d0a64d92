mmc: omap_hsmmc: fix DMA API warning

While booting with rootfs on MMC, the following warning is encountered
on OMAP4430:

omap-dma-engine 4a056000.dma-controller: DMA-API: mapping sg segment longer than device claims to support [len=69632] [max=65536]

This is because the DMA engine has a default maximum segment size of 64K
but HSMMC sets:

        mmc->max_blk_size = 512;       /* Block Length at max can be 1024 */
        mmc->max_blk_count = 0xFFFF;    /* No. of Blocks is 16 bits */
        mmc->max_req_size = mmc->max_blk_size * mmc->max_blk_count;
        mmc->max_seg_size = mmc->max_req_size;

which ends up telling the block layer that we support a maximum segment
size of 65535*512, which exceeds the advertised DMA engine capabilities.

Fix this by clamping the maximum segment size to the lower of the
maximum request size and of the DMA engine device used for either DMA
channel.
