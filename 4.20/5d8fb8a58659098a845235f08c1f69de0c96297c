signal/powerpc: Specialize _exception_pkey for handling pkey exceptions

Now that _exception no longer calls _exception_pkey it is no longer
necessary to handle any signal with any si_code.  All pkey exceptions
are SIGSEGV with paired with SEGV_PKUERR.  So just handle
that case and remove the now unnecessary parameters from _exception_pkey.
