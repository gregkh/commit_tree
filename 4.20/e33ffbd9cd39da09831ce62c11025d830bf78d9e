ASoC: dpcm: Properly initialise hw->rate_max

If the CPU DAI does not initialise rate_max, say if using
using KNOT or CONTINUOUS, then the rate_max field will be
initialised to 0. A value of zero in the rate_max field of
the hardware runtime will cause the sound card to support no
sample rates at all. Obviously this is not desired, just a
different mechanism is being used to apply the constraints. As
such update the setting of rate_max in dpcm_init_runtime_hw
to be consistent with the non-DPCM cases and set rate_max to
UINT_MAX if nothing is defined on the CPU DAI.
