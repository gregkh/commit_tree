fuse: add FOPEN_CACHE_DIR

Add flag returned by OPENDIR request to allow kernel to cache directory
contents in page cache.  The effect of FOPEN_CACHE_DIR is twofold:

 a) if not already cached, it writes entries into the cache

 b) if already cached, it allows reading entries from the cache

The FOPEN_KEEP_CACHE has the same effect as on regular files: unless this
flag is given the cache is cleared upon completion of open.

So FOPEN_KEEP_CACHE and FOPEN_KEEP_CACHE flags should be used together to
make use of the directory caching facility introduced in the following
patches.

The FUSE_AUTO_INVAL_DATA flag returned in INIT reply also has the same
affect on the directory cache as it has on data cache for regular files.
