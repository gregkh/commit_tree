drm/mxsfb: Add pm_runtime calls to pipe_enable/disable

Adding lcdif nodes to a power domain currently results in
black/corrupted screens or hangs because power is not correctly enabled
when required.

Ensure power is on when display is active by adding
pm_runtime_get/put_sync to mxsfb_pipe_enable/disable.
