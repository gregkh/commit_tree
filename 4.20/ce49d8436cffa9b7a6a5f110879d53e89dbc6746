perf strbuf: Match va_{add,copy} with va_end

Ensure that all code paths in strbuf_addv() call va_end() on the
ap_saved copy that was made.

Fixes the following coverity complaint:

  Error: VARARGS (CWE-237): [#def683]
  tools/perf/util/strbuf.c:106: missing_va_end: va_end was not called
  for "ap_saved".
