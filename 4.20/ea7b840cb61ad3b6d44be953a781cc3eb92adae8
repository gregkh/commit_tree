staging:rtl8192u: Refactor union delba_param_set - Style

remove member 'charData' from the union delba_param_set, as it is not
used in code. The remaining member variables have all been renamed to
clear the checkpatch issue with CamelCase naming.

shortData  to short_data
Reserved   to reserved
Initiator  to initiator
TID        to tid

These changes are all coding style changes which should have no
impact on runtime code execution.
