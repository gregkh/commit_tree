iommu/of: make of_pci_map_rid() available for other devices too

iommu-map property is also used by devices with fsl-mc. This
patch moves the of_pci_map_rid to generic location, so that it
can be used by other busses too.

'of_pci_map_rid' is renamed here to 'of_map_rid' and there is no
functional change done in the API.
