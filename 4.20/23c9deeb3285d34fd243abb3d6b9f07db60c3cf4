fanotify: deprecate uapi FAN_ALL_* constants

We do not want to add new bits to the FAN_ALL_* uapi constants
because they have been exposed to userspace.  If there are programs
out there using these constants, those programs could break if
re-compiled with modified FAN_ALL_* constants and run on an old kernel.

We deprecate the uapi constants FAN_ALL_* and define new FANOTIFY_*
constants for internal use to replace them. New feature bits will be
added only to the new constants.
