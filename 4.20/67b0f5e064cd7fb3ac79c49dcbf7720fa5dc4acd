thermal: tsens: Rename map field in order to add a second address map

The TSENS driver currently only uses a limited set of registers from the TM
address space. So it was ok to map just that set of registers and call it
"map".

We'd now like to map a second set: SROT registers to introduce new
functionality. Rename the "map" field to a more appropriate "tm_map".

The 8960 doesn't have a clear split between TM and SROT registers. To avoid
complicating the data structure, it will switchover to using tm_map for its
maps.

There is no functional change with this patch.
