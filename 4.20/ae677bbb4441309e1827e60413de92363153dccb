net: Don't return invalid table id error when dumping all families

When doing a route dump across all address families, do not error out
if the table does not exist. This allows a route dump for AF_UNSPEC
with a table id that may only exist for some of the families.

Do return the table does not exist error if dumping routes for a
specific family and the table does not exist.
