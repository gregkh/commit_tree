gpio: max7301: fix driver for use with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK

spi_read() and spi_write() require DMA-safe memory. When
CONFIG_VMAP_STACK is selected, those functions cannot be used
with buffers on stack.

This patch replaces calls to spi_read() and spi_write() by
spi_write_then_read() which doesn't require DMA-safe buffers.
