MAINTAINERS: Daniel for drm co-maintainer

lkml and Linus gained a CoC, and it's serious this time. Which means
my no 1 reason for declining to officially step up as drm maintainer
is gone, and I didn't find any new good excuse.

I chatted with a few people in private already, and the biggest
concern is that I mislay my community hat and start running around
with my intel hat only. Or some other convenient abuse of trust.

That's why this patch doesn't just need a lot of acks that mean "yeah
seems fine to me", but a lot of acks that mean "yeah we'll tell you
when you're over the line and usurp you from that comfy chair if you
don't get it". Which I think we've been done a fairly good job here at
dri-devel in general, but better to be clear.

Rough idea is that I'll do this for maybe 2-3 years, helping Dave
figure out a group model for drm overall. And getting the tooling and
infrastructure for that off the ground. Then step down again because
some other shiny thing that needs chasing. Of course as plans tend to
do, this one will probably pan out a bit different in reality.
