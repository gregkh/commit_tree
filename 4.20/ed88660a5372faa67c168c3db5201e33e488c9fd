block: move call of scheduler's ->completed_request() hook

Commit 4bc6339a583c ("block: move blk_stat_add() to
__blk_mq_end_request()") consolidated some calls using ktime_get() so
we'd only need to call it once. Kyber's ->completed_request() hook also
calls ktime_get(), so let's move it to the same place, too.
