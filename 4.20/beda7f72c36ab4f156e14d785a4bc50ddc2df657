mlxsw: spectrum: Seed LAG hash function

Currently, the seed of the LAG hash function is always set to 0, which
means it is identical across all switches. Instead, use a random number.

This is especially important now that VxLAN is supported, as the LAG
hash function is used to calculate the UDP source port of the
encapsulated packet.
