Revert "drm/amd/display: set backlight level limit to 1"

This reverts commit 0cafc82fae41531b0162150f9a97f2c74f97118f.

This breaks some apps that assume 0 is minimum brightness.

Revert for 4.20.  This is fixed properly for drm-next/4.21 in:
"drm/amd: Don't fail on backlight = 0"
However, that patch depends on more extensive changes to the
backlight interface which are too invasive for -fixes.
