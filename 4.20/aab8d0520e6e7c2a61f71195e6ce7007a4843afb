mm/rmap: map_pte() was not handling private ZONE_DEVICE page properly

Private ZONE_DEVICE pages use a special pte entry and thus are not
present.  Properly handle this case in map_pte(), it is already handled in
check_pte(), the map_pte() part was lost in some rebase most probably.

Without this patch the slow migration path can not migrate back to any
private ZONE_DEVICE memory to regular memory.  This was found after stress
testing migration back to system memory.  This ultimatly can lead to the
CPU constantly page fault looping on the special swap entry.
