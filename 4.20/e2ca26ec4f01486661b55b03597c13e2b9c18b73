Input: omap-keypad - fix idle configuration to not block SoC idle states

With PM enabled, I noticed that pressing a key on the droid4 keyboard will
block deeper idle states for the SoC. Let's fix this by using IRQF_ONESHOT
and stop constantly toggling the device OMAP4_KBD_IRQENABLE register as
suggested by Dmitry Torokhov <dmitry.torokhov@gmail.com>.

From the hardware point of view, looks like we need to manage the registers
for OMAP4_KBD_IRQENABLE and OMAP4_KBD_WAKEUPENABLE together to avoid
blocking deeper SoC idle states. And with toggling of OMAP4_KBD_IRQENABLE
register now gone with IRQF_ONESHOT, also the SoC idle state problem is
gone during runtime. We still also need to clear OMAP4_KBD_WAKEUPENABLE in
omap4_keypad_close() though to pair it with omap4_keypad_open() to prevent
blocking deeper SoC idle states after rmmod omap4-keypad.
