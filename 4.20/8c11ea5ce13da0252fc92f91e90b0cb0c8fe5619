bpf, arm64: fix getting subprog addr from aux for calls

The arm64 JIT has the same issue as ppc64 JIT in that the relative BPF
to BPF call offset can be too far away from core kernel in that relative
encoding into imm is not sufficient and could potentially be truncated,
see also fd045f6cd98e ("arm64: add support for module PLTs") which adds
spill-over space for module_alloc() and therefore bpf_jit_binary_alloc().
Therefore, use the recently added bpf_jit_get_func_addr() helper for
properly fetching the address through prog->aux->func[off]->bpf_func
instead. This also has the benefit to optimize normal helper calls since
their address can use the optimized emission. Tested on Cavium ThunderX
CN8890.
