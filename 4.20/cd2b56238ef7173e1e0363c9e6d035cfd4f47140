drm/amdgpu/gmc9: rework stolen vga memory handling

No functional change, just rework it in order to adjust the
behavior on a per asic level.  The problem is that on vega10,
something corrupts the lower 8 MB of vram on the second
resume from S3.  This does not seem to affect Raven, other
gmc9 based asics need testing.
