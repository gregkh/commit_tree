svm: Add mutex_lock to protect apic_access_page_done on AMD systems

There is a race condition when accessing kvm->arch.apic_access_page_done.
Due to it, x86_set_memory_region will fail when creating the second vcpu
for a svm guest.

Add a mutex_lock to serialize the accesses to apic_access_page_done.
This lock is also used by vmx for the same purpose.
