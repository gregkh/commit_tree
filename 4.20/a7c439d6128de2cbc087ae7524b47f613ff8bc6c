ASoC: soc-core: remove dai->driver NULL check

It is strange if it has "dai" but doesn't have "dai->driver".
And more over "dai->driver->xxx" is used everywhere without
"dai->driver" pointer NULL checking.
It got Oops already if "dai->driver" was NULL.
Let's remove un-needed "dai->driver" NULL check.
