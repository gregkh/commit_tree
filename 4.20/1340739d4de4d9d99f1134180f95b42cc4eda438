ASoC: audio-graph-scu-card: use simple_dai_props

audi-graph-card and audio-graph-scu-card are very similar driver,
but using different feature. Thus we are keeping synchronization
on these 2 drivers style, because it is easy to confirm / check.

Current big difference between these 2 drivers are "dai_props" on
graph_card_data (= priv).
It will be difficult to keep synchronize if we will add new feature
on audio-graph-scu-card. Thus, this patch synchronize it.

[audio-graph]
struct graph_card_data {
	...
	struct graph_dai_props {
		...
	} *dai_props;
	...
};

[audio-graph-scu]
struct graph_card_data {
	...
	struct asoc_simple_dai *dai_props;
	...
};
