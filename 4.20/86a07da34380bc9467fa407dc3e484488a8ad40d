Revert "net: vhost: lock the vqs one by one"

This reverts commit 78139c94dc8c96a478e67dab3bee84dc6eccb5fd. We don't
protect device IOTLB with vq mutex, which will lead e.g use after free
for device IOTLB entries. And since we've switched to use
mutex_trylock() in previous patch, it's safe to revert it without
having deadlock.
