Documentation: cpu-freq: Frequencies aren't always sorted

The order in which the frequencies are displayed in cpufreq stats
depends on the order in which the frequencies were sorted in the
frequency table provided to cpufreq core by the cpufreq driver. They can
be completely unsorted as well.

The documentation's claim that the stats will be sorted in descending
order is hence incorrect and here is an attempt to fix it.
