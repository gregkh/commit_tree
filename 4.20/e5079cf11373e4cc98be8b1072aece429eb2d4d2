media: vb2: set reqbufs/create_bufs capabilities

Set the capabilities field of v4l2_requestbuffers and v4l2_create_buffers.

The various mapping modes were easy, but for signaling the request capability
a new 'supports_requests' bitfield was added to videobuf2-core.h (and set in
vim2m and vivid). Drivers have to set this bitfield for any queue where
requests are supported.
