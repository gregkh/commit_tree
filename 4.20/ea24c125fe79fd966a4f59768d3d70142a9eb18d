doc: Improve rcu_dynticks::dynticks documentation

The very useful RCU Data-Structures describes that the dynticks counter
of the rcu_dynticks data structure is incremented when we transitions to
or from dynticks-idle mode. However it doesn't mention that it is also
incremented due to transitions to and from user mode which for dynticks
purposes is an extended quiescent state.

I found this with tracing calls to rcu_dynticks_eqs_enter which can also
happen from rcu_user_enter. Lets add this information to the
Data-Structures document.
