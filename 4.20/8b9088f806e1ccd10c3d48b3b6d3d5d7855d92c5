tcp, ulp: enforce sock_owned_by_me upon ulp init and cleanup

Whenever the ULP data on the socket is mangled, enforce that the
caller has the socket lock held as otherwise things may race with
initialization and cleanup callbacks from ulp ops as both would
mangle internal socket state.

Joint work with John.
