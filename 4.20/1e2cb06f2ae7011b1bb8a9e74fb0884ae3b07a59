media: i2c: adv748x: Register only enabled inputs

The adv748x assumes input endpoints are always enabled, and registers
a subdevice for each of them when the corresponding output subdevice
is registered.

Fix this by conditionally registering the input subdevice only if it is
actually described in device tree.
