staging: erofs: fix a bug when appling cache strategy

As described in Kconfig, the last compressed pack should be cached
for further reading for either `EROFS_FS_ZIP_CACHE_UNIPOLAR' or
`EROFS_FS_ZIP_CACHE_BIPOLAR' by design.

However, there is a bug in z_erofs_do_read_page, it will
switch `initial' to `false' at the very beginning before it decides
to cache the last compressed pack.

caching strategy should work properly after appling this patch.
