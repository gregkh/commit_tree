soc: qcom: Allow COMPILE_TEST of qcom SoC Kconfigs

Since commit cab673583d96 ("soc: Unconditionally include qcom Makefile"),
we unconditionally include the soc/qcom/Makefile.

This opens up the possibility to compile test the code even when building
for other architectures.

Allow COMPILE_TEST for all qcom SoC Kconfigs, except for two Kconfigs
that depend on QCOM_SCM, since that triggers lots of build errors in
qcom_scm.
