xdp: unlikely instrumentation for xdp map redirect

Notice the compiler generated ASM code layout was suboptimal.  It
assumed map enqueue errors as the likely case, which is shouldn't.
It assumed that xdp_do_flush_map() was a likely case, due to maps
changing between packets, which should be very unlikely.
