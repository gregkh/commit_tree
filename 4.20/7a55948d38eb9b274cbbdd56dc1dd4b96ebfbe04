bcache: account size of buckets used in uuid write to ca->meta_sectors_written

UUIDs are considered as metadata. __uuid_write should add the number
of buckets (in sectors) written to disk to ca->meta_sectors_written.
Currently only 1 bucket is used in uuid write.

Steps to test:
1) create a fresh backing device and a fresh cache device separately.
   The backing device didn't attach to any cache set.
2) cd /sys/block/<cache device>/bcache
   cat metadata_written      // record the output value
   cat bucket_size
3) attach the backing device to cache set
4) cat metadata_written
   The output value is almost the same as the value in step 2
   before the change.
   After the change, the value is bigger about 1 bucket size.
