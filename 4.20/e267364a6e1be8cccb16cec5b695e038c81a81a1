drm/atomic: Initialise planes with opaque alpha values

Planes without an alpha property, using __drm_atomic_helper_plane_reset
will have their plane state alpha initialised as zero, which represents
a transparent alpha.

If this value is then used for the plane, it may not be visible by
default, and thus doesn't represent a good initialisation state.

Update the default state->alpha value to DRM_BLEND_ALPHA_OPAQUE
unconditionally when the plane is reset.
