x86-32/asm/power: Create stack frames in hibernate_asm_32.S

swsusp_arch_suspend() is callable non-leaf function which doesn't
honor CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER, which can result in bad stack traces.
Also it's not annotated as ELF callable function which can confuse tooling.

Create a stack frame for it when CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER is enabled and
give it proper ELF function annotation.

Also in this patch introduces the restore_registers() symbol and
gives it ELF function annotation, thus to prepare for later register
restore.

Analogous changes were made for 64bit before in commit ef0f3ed5a4ac
(x86/asm/power: Create stack frames in hibernate_asm_64.S) and
commit 4ce827b4cc58 (x86/power/64: Fix hibernation return address
corruption).
