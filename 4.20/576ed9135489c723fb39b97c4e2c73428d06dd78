block: use bio_add_page in bio_iov_iter_get_pages

Replace a nasty hack with a different nasty hack to prepare for multipage
bio_vecs.  By moving the temporary page array as far up as possible in
the space allocated for the bio_vec array we can iterate forward over it
and thus use bio_add_page.  Using bio_add_page means we'll be able to
merge physically contiguous pages once support for multipath bio_vecs is
merged.
