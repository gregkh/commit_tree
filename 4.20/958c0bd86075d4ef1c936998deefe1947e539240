usb: xhci: fix uninitialized completion when USB3 port got wrong status

Realtek USB3.0 Card Reader [0bda:0328] reports wrong port status on
Cannon lake PCH USB3.1 xHCI [8086:a36d] after resume from S3,
after clear port reset it works fine.

Since this device is registered on USB3 roothub at boot,
when port status reports not superspeed, xhci_get_port_status will call
an uninitialized completion in bus_state[0].
Kernel will hang because of NULL pointer.

Restrict the USB2 resume status check in USB2 roothub to fix hang issue.
