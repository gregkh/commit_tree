mm: export add_swap_extent()

Btrfs currently does not support swap files because swap's use of bmap
does not work with copy-on-write and multiple devices.  See 35054394c4b3
("Btrfs: stop providing a bmap operation to avoid swapfile corruptions").

However, the swap code has a mechanism for the filesystem to manually add
swap extents using add_swap_extent() from the ->swap_activate() aop.
iomap has done this since 67482129cdab ("iomap: add a swapfile activation
function").  Btrfs will do the same in a later patch, so export
add_swap_extent().
