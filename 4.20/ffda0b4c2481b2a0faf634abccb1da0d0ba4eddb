media: v4l2-ctrls: improve media_request_(un)lock_for_update

The request reference count was decreased again once a reference to the
request object was taken. Postpone this until we finished using the object.

In theory I think it is possible that the request_fd can be closed by
the application from another thread. In that case when request_put is
called the whole request would be freed.

It's highly unlikely, but let's just be safe and fix this potential
race condition.
