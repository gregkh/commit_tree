Revert "HID: uhid: use strlcpy() instead of strncpy()"

This reverts commit 336fd4f5f25157e9e8bd50e898a1bbcd99eaea46.

Please note that `strlcpy()` does *NOT* do what you think it does.
strlcpy() *ALWAYS* reads the full input string, regardless of the
'length' parameter. That is, if the input is not zero-terminated,
strlcpy() will *READ* beyond input boundaries. It does this, because it
always returns the size it *would* copy if the target was big enough,
not the truncated size it actually copied.

The original code was perfectly fine. The hid device is
zero-initialized and the strncpy() functions copied up to n-1
characters. The result is always zero-terminated this way.

This is the third time someone tried to replace strncpy with strlcpy in
this function, and gets it wrong. I now added a comment that should at
least make people reconsider.
