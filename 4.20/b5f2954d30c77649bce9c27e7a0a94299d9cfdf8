blkcg: revert blkcg cleanups series

This reverts a series committed earlier due to null pointer exception
bug report in [1]. It seems there are edge case interactions that I did
not consider and will need some time to understand what causes the
adverse interactions.

The original series can be found in [2] with a follow up series in [3].
