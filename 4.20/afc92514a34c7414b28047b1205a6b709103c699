usb: gadget: udc: renesas_usb3: Fix b-device mode for "workaround"

If the "workaround_for_vbus" is true, the driver will not call
usb_disconnect(). So, since the controller keeps some registers'
value, the driver doesn't re-enumarate suitable speed after
the b-device mode is disabled. To fix the issue, this patch
adds usb_disconnect() calling in renesas_usb3_b_device_write()
if workaround_for_vbus is true.
