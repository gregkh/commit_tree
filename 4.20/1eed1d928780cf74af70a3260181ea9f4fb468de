staging:rtl8192u: Remove definition of HTSetConnectBwMode - Style

Remove the redundant declaration of the function HTSetConnectBwMode()
as it is not needed in the code. The function is already declared
in header file, multiple declarations add nothing.

This is a style change which should have no impact on runtime code
execution.
