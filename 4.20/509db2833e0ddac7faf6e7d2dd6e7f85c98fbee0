bpf: error handling when map_lookup_elem isn't supported

The error value returned by map_lookup_elem doesn't differentiate
whether lookup was failed because of invalid key or lookup is not
supported.

Lets add handling for -EOPNOTSUPP return value of map_lookup_elem()
method of map, with expectation from map's implementation that it
should return -EOPNOTSUPP if lookup is not supported.

The errno for bpf syscall for BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM command will be set
to EOPNOTSUPP if map lookup is not supported.
