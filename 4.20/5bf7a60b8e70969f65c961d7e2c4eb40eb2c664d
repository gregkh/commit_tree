bpf: permit CGROUP_DEVICE programs accessing helper bpf_get_current_cgroup_id()

Currently, helper bpf_get_current_cgroup_id() is not permitted
for CGROUP_DEVICE type of programs. If the helper is used
in such cases, the verifier will log the following error:

  0: (bf) r6 = r1
  1: (69) r7 = *(u16 *)(r6 +0)
  2: (85) call bpf_get_current_cgroup_id#80
  unknown func bpf_get_current_cgroup_id#80

The bpf_get_current_cgroup_id() is useful for CGROUP_DEVICE
type of programs in order to customize action based on cgroup id.
This patch added such a support.
