cpuidle: menu: Drop redundant comparison

Since the correction factor cannot be greater than RESOLUTION * DECAY,
the result of the predicted_us computation in menu_select() cannot be
greater than data->next_timer_us, so it is not necessary to compare
the "typical interval" value coming from get_typical_interval() with
data->next_timer_us separately.

It is sufficient to copmare predicted_us with the return value of
get_typical_interval() directly, so do that and drop the now
redundant expected_interval variable.

No intentional changes of behavior.
