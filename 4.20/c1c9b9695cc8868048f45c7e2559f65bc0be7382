perf script: Allow extended console debug output

The script tool isn't using a browser, yet use_browser wasn't set
explicitly to zero. This in turn lead to confusing output such as:

  ```
  $ perf script -vvv ...
  ...
  overlapping maps in /home/milian/foobar (disable tui for more info)
  ...
  ```

Explicitly set use_browser to 0 now, which gives us the extended
debug information now in perf script as expected.
