usb: quirk: add no-LPM quirk on SanDisk Ultra Flair device

Some lower volume SanDisk Ultra Flair in 16GB, which the VID:PID is
in 0781:5591, will aggressively request LPM of U1/U2 during runtime,
when using this thumb drive as the OS installation key we found the
device will generate failure during U1 exit path making it dropped
from the USB bus, this causes a corrupted installation in system at
the end.

i.e.,
[  166.918296] hub 2-0:1.0: state 7 ports 7 chg 0000 evt 0004
[  166.918327] usb usb2-port2: link state change
[  166.918337] usb usb2-port2: do warm reset
[  166.970039] usb usb2-port2: not warm reset yet, waiting 50ms
[  167.022040] usb usb2-port2: not warm reset yet, waiting 200ms

...

Analyzed the USB trace in the link layer we realized it is because
of the 6-ms timer of tRecoveryConfigurationTimeout which documented
on the USB 3.2 Revision 1.0, the section 7.5.10.4.2 of "Exit from
Recovery.Configuration"; device initiates U1 exit -> Recovery.Active
-> Recovery.Configuration, then the host timer timeout makes the link
transits to eSS.Inactive -> Rx.Detect follows by a Warm Reset.

Interestingly, the other higher volume of SanDisk Ultra Flair sharing
the same VID:PID, such as 64GB, would not request LPM during runtime,
it sticks at U0 always, thus disabling LPM does not affect those thumb
drives at all.

The same odd occures in SanDisk Ultra Fit 16GB, VID:PID in 0781:5583.
