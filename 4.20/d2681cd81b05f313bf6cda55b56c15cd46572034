mmc: meson-mx-sdio: mark expected switch fall-through

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases
where we are expecting to fall through.

Notice that in this particular case, I replaced the "fall-through:"
comment with a proper "fall through", which is what GCC is
expecting to find.
