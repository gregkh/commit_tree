dmaengine: cppi41: delete channel from pending list when stop channel

The driver defines three states for a cppi channel.
- idle: .chan_busy == 0 && not in .pending list
- pending: .chan_busy == 0 && in .pending list
- busy: .chan_busy == 1 && not in .pending list

There are cases in which the cppi channel could be in the pending state
when cppi41_dma_issue_pending() is called after cppi41_runtime_suspend()
is called.

cppi41_stop_chan() has a bug for these cases to set channels to idle state.
It only checks the .chan_busy flag, but not the .pending list, then later
when cppi41_runtime_resume() is called the channels in .pending list will
be transitioned to busy state.

Removing channels from the .pending list solves the problem.
