ath10k: add bus type check in ath10k_init_hw_params

The bus type is used together with the other hw parameters
to find a matching entry in ath10k_hw_params_list for the device.

This is necessary since HL devices can have the same dev_id and
target_version as a corresponding LL device (same chipset) and
yet use a totally different configuration.
