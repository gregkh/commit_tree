asm-generic: Move common compat types to asm-generic/compat.h

While converting compat system call handlers to work on 32-bit
architectures, I found a number of types used in those handlers
that are identical between all architectures.

Let's move all the identical ones into asm-generic/compat.h to avoid
having to add even more identical definitions of those types.

For unknown reasons, mips defines __compat_gid32_t, __compat_uid32_t
and compat_caddr_t as signed, while all others have them unsigned.
This seems to be a mistake, but I'm leaving it alone here. The other
types all differ by size or alignment on at least on architecture.

compat_aio_context_t is currently defined in linux/compat.h but
also needed for compat_sys_io_getevents(), so let's move it into
the same place.

While we still have not decided whether the 32-bit time handling
will always use the compat syscalls, or in which form, I think this
is a useful cleanup that we can merge regardless.
