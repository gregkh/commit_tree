kvm: x86: Defer setting of CR2 until #PF delivery

When exception payloads are enabled by userspace (which is not yet
possible) and a #PF is raised in L2, defer the setting of CR2 until
the #PF is delivered. This allows the L1 hypervisor to intercept the
fault before CR2 is modified.

For backwards compatibility, when exception payloads are not enabled
by userspace, kvm_multiple_exception modifies CR2 when the #PF
exception is raised.
