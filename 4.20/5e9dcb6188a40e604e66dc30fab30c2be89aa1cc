powerpc/boot: Expose Kconfig symbols to wrapper

Currently the wrapper is built without including anything in
$(src)/include/, which means there are no CONFIG_ symbols defined.
This means the platform specific serial drivers were never enabled.

We now copy the definitions into the boot directory, so any C file can
now include autoconf.h to depend on configuration options.
