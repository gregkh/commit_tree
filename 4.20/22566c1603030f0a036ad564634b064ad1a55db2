objtool: Fix segfault in .cold detection with -ffunction-sections

Because find_symbol_by_name() traverses the same lists as
read_symbols(), changing sym->name in place without copying it affects
the result of find_symbol_by_name().  In the case where a ".cold"
function precedes its parent in sec->symbol_list, it can result in a
function being considered a parent of itself. This leads to function
length being set to 0 and other consequent side-effects including a
segfault in add_switch_table().  The effects of this bug are only
visible when building with -ffunction-sections in KCFLAGS.

Fix by copying the search string instead of modifying it in place.
