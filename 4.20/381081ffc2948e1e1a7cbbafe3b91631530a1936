clk: renesas: r8a77970: Add SD0H/SD0 clocks for SDHI

On R-Car V3M (AKA R8A77970), the SD0CKCR is laid out differently than on
the other R-Car gen3 SoCs. In fact, the layout is the same as on R-Car gen2
SoCs, so we'll need to copy the divisor tables from the R-Car gen2 driver.
We'll also need to support the SoC specific clock types, thus we're adding
CLK_TYPE_GEN3_SOC_BASE at the end of 'enum rcar_gen3_clk_types', declare
SD0H/SDH clocks in 'enum r8a77970_clk_types', and handle those clocks in
the overridden cpg_clk_register() method; then, finally, add the SD-IF
module clock (derived from the SD0 clock).
