net/ncsi: Extend NC-SI Netlink interface to allow user space to send NC-SI command

The new command (NCSI_CMD_SEND_CMD) is added to allow user space application
to send NC-SI command to the network card.
Also, add a new attribute (NCSI_ATTR_DATA) for transferring request and response.

The work flow is as below.

Request:
User space application
	-> Netlink interface (msg)
	-> new Netlink handler - ncsi_send_cmd_nl()
	-> ncsi_xmit_cmd()

Response:
Response received - ncsi_rcv_rsp()
	-> internal response handler - ncsi_rsp_handler_xxx()
	-> ncsi_rsp_handler_netlink()
	-> ncsi_send_netlink_rsp ()
	-> Netlink interface (msg)
	-> user space application

Command timeout - ncsi_request_timeout()
	-> ncsi_send_netlink_timeout ()
	-> Netlink interface (msg with zero data length)
	-> user space application

Error:
Error detected
	-> ncsi_send_netlink_err ()
	-> Netlink interface (err msg)
	-> user space application
