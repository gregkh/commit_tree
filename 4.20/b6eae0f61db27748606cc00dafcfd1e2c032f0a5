libnvdimm: Hold reference on parent while scheduling async init

Unlike asynchronous initialization in the core we have not yet associated
the device with the parent, and as such the device doesn't hold a reference
to the parent.

In order to resolve that we should be holding a reference on the parent
until the asynchronous initialization has completed.
