net/mlx4: Fix UBSAN warning of signed integer overflow

UBSAN: Undefined behavior in
drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx4/resource_tracker.c:626:29
signed integer overflow: 1802201963 + 1802201963 cannot be represented
in type 'int'

The union of res_reserved and res_port_rsvd[MLX4_MAX_PORTS] monitors
granting of reserved resources. The grant operation is calculated and
protected, thus both members of the union cannot be negative.  Changed
type of res_reserved and of res_port_rsvd[MLX4_MAX_PORTS] from signed
int to unsigned int, allowing large value.
