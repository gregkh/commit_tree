iio: adc: meson-saradc: do not use meson_sar_adc_iio_channels directly

In the future we may support two different channel sets:
- one which includes the voltage pads and the temperature sensor output
  (for Meson8, Meson8b and Meson8m2)
- one which only includes the voltage pads (GXBB, GXL, GXM and AXG)

Channel 7 has a special function on all of these platforms. However,
since we will have different channel array definitions we want our code
to always use whatever channels struct iio_dev uses.

No functional changes for now. This is the preparation for adding
temperature sensor support to this driver.
