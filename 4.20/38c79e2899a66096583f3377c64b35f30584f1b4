clk: renesas: rcar-gen3: Add support for OSC EXTAL predivider

Add a clock type and macro for defining clocks using the OSC EXTAL
predivider combined with a fixed divider.

On most R-Car Gen3 SoCs, the predivider value depends on mode pins, and
thus must be specified in the configuration structure.

Inspired by a patch in the BSP by Takeshi Kihara
