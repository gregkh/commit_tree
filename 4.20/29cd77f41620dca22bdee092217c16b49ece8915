libbpf: Support loading individual progs

Allow the individual program load to be invoked. This will help with
testing, where a single ELF may contain several sections, some of which
denote subprograms that are expected to fail verification, along with
some which are expected to pass verification. By allowing programs to be
iterated and individually loaded, each program can be independently
checked against its expected verification result.
