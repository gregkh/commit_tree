scsi: NCR5380: Check for invalid reselection target

The X3T9.2 specification (draft) says, under "6.1.4.1 RESELECTION", that "the
initiator shall not respond to a RESELECTION phase if other than two SCSI ID
bits are on the DATA BUS." This issue (too many bits set) has been observed in
the wild, so add a check.
