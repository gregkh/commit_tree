xen/netfront: tolerate frags with no data

At least old Xen net backends seem to send frags with no real data
sometimes. In case such a fragment happens to occur with the frag limit
already reached the frontend will BUG currently even if this situation
is easily recoverable.

Modify the BUG_ON() condition accordingly.
