nfp: bpf: rename nfp_prog->stack_depth as nfp_prog->stack_frame_depth

In preparation for support for BPF to BPF calls in offloaded programs,
rename the "stack_depth" field of the struct nfp_prog as
"stack_frame_depth". This is to make it clear that the field refers to
the maximum size of the current stack frame (as opposed to the maximum
size of the whole stack memory).
