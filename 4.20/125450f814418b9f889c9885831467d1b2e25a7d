PCI: hotplug: Embed hotplug_slot

When the PCI hotplug core and its first user, cpqphp, were introduced in
February 2002 with historic commit a8a2069f432c, cpqphp allocated a slot
struct for its internal use plus a hotplug_slot struct to be registered
with the hotplug core and linked the two with pointers:
https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/a8a2069f432c

Nowadays, the predominant pattern in the tree is to embed ("subclass")
such structures in one another and cast to the containing struct with
container_of().  But it wasn't until July 2002 that container_of() was
introduced with historic commit ec4f214232cf:
https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/ec4f214232cf

pnv_php, introduced in 2016, did the right thing and embedded struct
hotplug_slot in its internal struct pnv_php_slot, but all other drivers
cargo-culted cpqphp's design and linked separate structs with pointers.

Embedding structs is preferrable to linking them with pointers because
it requires fewer allocations, thereby reducing overhead and simplifying
error paths.  Casting an embedded struct to the containing struct
becomes a cheap subtraction rather than a dereference.  And having fewer
pointers reduces the risk of them pointing nowhere either accidentally
or due to an attack.

Convert all drivers to embed struct hotplug_slot in their internal slot
struct.  The "private" pointer in struct hotplug_slot thereby becomes
unused, so drop it.
