drm/fb_helper: Allow leaking fbdev smem_start

Since "drm/fb: Stop leaking physical address", the default behaviour of
the DRM fbdev emulation is to set the smem_base to 0 and pass the new
FBINFO_HIDE_SMEM_START flag.

The main reason is to avoid leaking physical addresse to user-space, and
it follows a general move over the kernel code to avoid user-space to
manipulate physical addresses and then use some other mechanisms like
dma-buf to transfer physical buffer handles over multiple subsystems.

But, a lot of devices depends on closed sources binaries to enable
OpenGL hardware acceleration that uses this smem_start value to
pass physical addresses to out-of-tree modules in order to render
into these physical adresses. These should use dma-buf buffers allocated
from the DRM display device instead and stop relying on fbdev overallocation
to gather DMA memory (some HW vendors delivers GBM and Wayland capable
binaries, but older unsupported devices won't have these new binaries
and are doomed until an Open Source solution like Lima finalizes).

Since these devices heavily depends on this kind of software and because
the smem_start population was available for years, it's a breakage to
stop leaking smem_start without any alternative solutions.

This patch adds a Kconfig depending on the EXPERT config and an unsafe
kernel module parameter tainting the kernel when enabled.

A clear comment and Kconfig help text was added to clarify why and when
this patch should be reverted, but in the meantime it's a necessary
feature to keep.
