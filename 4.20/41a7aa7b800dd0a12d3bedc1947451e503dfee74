octeontx2-af: NIX Rx flowkey configuration for RSS

Configure NIX RX flowkey algorithm configuration to support
RSS (receive side scaling). Currently support for only L3/L4
2-tuple and 4-tuple hash of IPv4/v6/TCP/UDP/SCTP is added.
HW supports upto 32 different flowkey algorithms which SW
can define, this patch defines 9. NPC RX ACTION has to point
to one of these flowkey indices for RSS to work.

The configuration is dependent on NPC parse result's layer
info. So if NPC KPU profile changes suchthat LID/LTYPE values
of above said protocols change then this configuration will
most likely be effected.
