crypto: arm/ghash-ce - implement support for 4-way aggregation

Speed up the GHASH algorithm based on 64-bit polynomial multiplication
by adding support for 4-way aggregation. This improves throughput by
~85% on Cortex-A53, from 1.7 cycles per byte to 0.9 cycles per byte.

When combined with AES into GCM, throughput improves by ~25%, from
3.8 cycles per byte to 3.0 cycles per byte.
