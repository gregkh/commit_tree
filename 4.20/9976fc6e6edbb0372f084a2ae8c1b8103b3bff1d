netfilter: conntrack: remove the l4proto->new() function

->new() gets invoked after ->error() and before ->packet() if
a conntrack lookup has found no result for the tuple.

We can fold it into ->packet() -- the packet() implementations
can check if the conntrack is confirmed (new) or not
(already in hash).

If its unconfirmed, the conntrack isn't in the hash yet so current
skb created a new conntrack entry.

Only relevant side effect -- if packet() doesn't return NF_ACCEPT
but -NF_ACCEPT (or drop), while the conntrack was just created,
then the newly allocated conntrack is freed right away, rather than not
created in the first place.
