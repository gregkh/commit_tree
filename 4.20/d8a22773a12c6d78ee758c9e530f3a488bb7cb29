ubifs: Enable authentication support

With the preparations all being done this patch now enables authentication
support for UBIFS. Authentication is enabled when the newly introduced
auth_key and auth_hash_name mount options are passed. auth_key provides
the key which is used for authentication whereas auth_hash_name provides
the hashing algorithm used for this FS. Passing these options make
authentication mandatory and only UBIFS images that can be authenticated
with the given key are allowed.
