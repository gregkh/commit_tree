usb: dwc2: gadget: enable WKUP_ALERT interrupt

WKUP_ALERT interrupt should be unmask when lpm mode is enabled.

This interrupt is asserted when the device is in L1 for the duration
mentioned in GREFCLK.SOF_CNN_WKUP_ALERT. This is used to alert SW to
initiate Remote wake up so that the device resumes in time in order not
to lose sync with the host frame number.
