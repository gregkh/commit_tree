IB/mlx5: Set uid as part of CQ creation

Set uid as part of CQ creation so that the firmware can manage the
CQ object in a secured way.

The uid for the destroy and the modify commands is set by mlx5_core.

This will enable using a CQ that was created by verbs application to
be used by the DEVX flow in case the uid is equal.
