serial: uartps: Do not allow use aliases >= MAX_UART_INSTANCES

Aliases >= MAX_UART_INSTANCES is no problem to find out and use but in
error path is necessary skip clearing bits in bitmap to ensure that only
bits in allocated bitmap are handled and nothing beyond that.
Without this patch when for example serial90 alias is used then in error
patch bit 90 is clear in 32bit wide bitmap.
