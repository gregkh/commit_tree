v9fs_dir_readdir: fix double-free on p9stat_read error

p9stat_read will call p9stat_free on error, we should only free the
struct content on success.

There also is no need to "p9stat_init" st as the read function will
zero the whole struct for us anyway, so clean up the code a bit while
we are here.
