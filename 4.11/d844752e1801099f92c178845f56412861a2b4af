scsi: aacraid: Fix a potential spinlock double unlock bug

The driver does not unlock the reply  queue spin lock after handling SMART
adapter events. Instead it might attempt to unlock an already unlocked
spin lock.

Fixed by making sure the driver locks the spin lock before freeing it.

Thank you dan for finding this issue out.
