rdmacg: Fixed uninitialized current resource usage

Fixed warning reported by kbuild test robot.
When reading current resource usage value, when no resources are
allocated, its possible that it can report a uninitialized value
for current resource usage.
This fix avoids it by initializing it to zero as no resource is
allocated.
