openvswitch: Simplify do_execute_actions().

do_execute_actions() implements a worthwhile optimization: in case
an output action is the last action in an action list, skb_clone()
can be avoided by outputing the current skb. However, the
implementation is more complicated than necessary.  This patch
simplify this logic.
