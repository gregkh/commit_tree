rtc: sun6i: Switch to the external oscillator

The RTC is clocked from either an internal, imprecise, oscillator or an
external one, which is usually much more accurate.

The difference perceived between the time elapsed and the time reported by
the RTC is in a 10% scale, which prevents the RTC from being useful at all.

Fortunately, the external oscillator is reported to be mandatory in the
Allwinner datasheet, so we can just switch to it.
