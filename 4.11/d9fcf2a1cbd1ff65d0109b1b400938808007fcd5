s390: fix in-kernel program checks

A program check inside the kernel takes a slightly different path in
entry.S compare to a normal user fault. A recent change moved the store
of the breaking event address into the path taken for in-kernel program
checks as well, but %r14 has not been setup to point to the correct
location. A wild store is the consequence.

Move the store of the breaking event address to the code path for
user space faults.
