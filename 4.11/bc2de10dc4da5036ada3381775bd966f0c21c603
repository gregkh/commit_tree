ceph: convert bools in ceph_mds_request to a new r_req_flags field

Currently, we have a bunch of bool flags in struct ceph_mds_request. We
need more flags though, but each bool takes (at least) a byte. Those
add up over time.

Merge all of the existing bools in this struct into a single unsigned
long, and use the set/test/clear_bit macros to manipulate them. These
are atomic operations, but that is required here to prevent
load/modify/store races. The existing flags are protected by different
locks, so we can't rely on them for that purpose.
