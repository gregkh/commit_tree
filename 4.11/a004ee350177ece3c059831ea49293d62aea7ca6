arm64: dts: allwinner: add USB1-related nodes of Allwinner A64

Allwinner A64 have two HCI USB controllers, a OTG controller and a USB
PHY device which have two ports. One of the port is wired to both a HCI
USB controller and the OTG controller, which is currently not supported.
The another one is only wired to a HCI controller, and the device node of
OHCI/EHCI controller of the port can be added now.

Also the A64 USB PHY device node is also added for the HCI controllers to
work.
