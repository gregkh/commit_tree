staging: rtl8188eu: remove unused field bRxRSSIDisplay in struct adapter

Since commit da25a8ec6b2d ("staging: rtl8188eu: remove unused
debugging functions") this field is never set set to any nonzero
value, so it is actually always zero.

It is also used only once, as a boolean inside an if(). This means the
code under that if() is dead code, so remove it as well.
