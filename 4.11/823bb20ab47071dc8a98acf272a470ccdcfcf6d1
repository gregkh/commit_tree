btrfs: add wrapper for counting BTRFS_MAX_EXTENT_SIZE

The expression is open-coded in several places, this asks for a wrapper.
As we know the MAX_EXTENT fits to u32, we can use the appropirate
division helper. This cascades to the result type updates.

Compiler is clever enough to use shift instead of integer division, so
there's no change in the generated assembly.
