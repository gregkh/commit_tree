staging: comedi: daqboard2000: define macros for CPLD registers

The Daqboard/2000 uses a write-only data register and a read-only status
register in a pre-programmed CPLD device to program the main firmware on
the board.  Both registers are at offset 0x1000 from PCI BAR 2.  Define
macros for the register offsets.  Rename the existing macros for the
status register values for consistency.  (Two status bits are defined,
but the driver code only seems to use one of them.)
