powerpc/mm: refactor radix physical page mapping

Move the page mapping code in radix_init_pgtable() into a separate
function that will also be used for memory hotplug.

The current goto loop progressively decreases its mapping size as it
covers the tail of a range whose end is unaligned. Change this to a for
loop which can do the same for both ends of the range.
