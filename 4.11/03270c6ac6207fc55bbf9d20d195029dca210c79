parport: fix attempt to write duplicate procfiles

Usually every parallel port will have a single pardev registered with
it. But ppdev driver is an exception. This userspace parallel port
driver allows to create multiple parrallel port devices for a single
parallel port. And as a result we were having a nice warning like:
"sysctl table check failed:
/dev/parport/parport0/devices/ppdev0/timeslice Sysctl already exists"

Use the same logic as used in parport_register_device() and register
the proc files only once for each parallel port.
