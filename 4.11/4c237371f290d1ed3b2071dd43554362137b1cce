ACPI / EC: Remove old CLEAR_ON_RESUME quirk

IRQ polling logic has been implemented to drain the post-boot/resume
EC events:

 1. Triggered by the following code, invoked from acpi_ec_enable_event():

	if (!test_bit(EC_FLAGS_QUERY_PENDING, &ec->flags))
		advance_transaction(ec);

 2. Drained by the following code, invoked after acpi_ec_complete_query():

	if (status & ACPI_EC_FLAG_SCI)
		acpi_ec_submit_query(ec);

This facility is safer than the old CLEAR_ON_RESUME quirk as the
CLEAR_ON_RESUME quirk sends EC query commands unconditionally. The
behavior is apparently not suitable for firmware that requires
QUERY_HANDSHAKE quirk. Though the QUERY_HANDSHAKE quirk isn't used
now because of the improvement done in the EC transaction state
machine (ec_event_clearing=QUERY), it is the proof that we cannot
send EC query command unconditionally.

So it's time to delete the out-dated CLEAR_ON_RESUME quirk to let the
users to try the newer approach.
