ia64: move ia64_done_with_exception out of asm/uaccess.h

Move ia64_done_with_exception out of asm/uaccess.h (which is widely
used) and into asm/exception.h (like ARM has) and then ensure the
few callers of it include this new header.

Most of the other C content in asm files is implemented in macro form.
So we do that conversion at the same time as the move.

There are two C exception prototypes that move along with the macro.
One of them will become redundant when we switch over to using the
<linux/extable.h> instead of <linux/module.h> header in a subsequent
commit.

Also relocate a couple of the automated asm --> linux uaccess
conversions to preserve the linux and asm independent grouping, since
we are in the file at that location anyway.
