ktest: Make sure wait_for_input does honor the timeout

The function wait_for_input takes in a timeout, and even has a default
timeout. But if for some reason the STDIN descriptor keeps sending in data,
the function will never time out. The timout is to wait for the data from
the passed in file descriptor, not for STDIN. Adding a test in the case
where there's no data from the passed in file descriptor that checks to see
if the timeout passed, will ensure that it will timeout properly even if
there's input in STDIN.
