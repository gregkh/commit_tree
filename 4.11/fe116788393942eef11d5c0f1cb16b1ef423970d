mwifiex: pcie: read FROMDEVICE DMA-able memory with READ_ONCE()

In mwifiex_delay_for_sleep_cookie(), we're looping and waiting for the
PCIe endpoint to write a magic value back to memory, to signal that it
has finished going to sleep. We're not letting the compiler know that
this might change underneath our feet though. Let's do that, for good
hygiene.

I'm not aware of this fixing any concrete problems. I also give no
guarantee that this loop is actually correct in any other way, but at
least this looks like an improvement to me.
