scripts/spelling.txt: add "comsume(r)" pattern and fix typo instances

Fix typos and add the following to the scripts/spelling.txt:

  comsume||consume
  comsumer||consumer
  comsuming||consuming

I see some variable names with this pattern, but this commit is only
touching comment blocks to avoid unexpected impact.
