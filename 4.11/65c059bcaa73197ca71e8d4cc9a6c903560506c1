powerpc: Enable support for GCC plugins

Enable support for GCC plugins on powerpc.

Add an additional version check in gcc-plugins-check to advise users to
upgrade to gcc 5.2+ on powerpc to avoid issues with header files (gcc <=
4.6) or missing copies of rs6000-cpus.def (4.8 to 5.1 on 64-bit
targets).
