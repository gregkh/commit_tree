scsi: ufs: fix setting init power mode

Immediately after successful UFS link startup, UFS link power mode would
be in PWM-G1, 1-lane, SLOW-AUTO mode. But currently we are doing few
of the DME local/peer attributes access before setting the "hba->pwr_info"
to default power mode. If we are doing link startup as part of error
recovery then old power mode might be set to FAST mode and doing DME peer
access (after link startup but before updating "hba->pwr_info" to default
power mode) unintentionally tries to switch from FAST to FAST_AUTO mode (if
UFSHCD_QUIRK_DME_PEER_ACCESS_AUTO_MODE quirk is enabled).

Above issue is fixed by setting the default power mode immediately after
successful link startup.
