net: introduce keepalive function in struct proto

Direct call of tcp_set_keepalive() function from protocol-agnostic
sock_setsockopt() function in net/core/sock.c violates network
layering. And newly introduced protocol (SMC-R) will need its own
keepalive function. Therefore, add "keepalive" function pointer
to "struct proto", and call it from sock_setsockopt() via this pointer.
