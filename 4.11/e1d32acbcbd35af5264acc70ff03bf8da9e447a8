qed*: Change maximal number of queues

Today qede requests contexts that would suffice for 64 'whole'
combined queues [192 meant for 64 rx, tx and xdp tx queues],
but registers netdev and limits the number of queues based on
information received by qed. In turn, qed doesn't take context
into account when informing qede how many queues it can support.

This would lead to a configuration problem in case user tries
configuring >64 combined queues to interface [or >96 in case
xdp isn't enabled]. Since we don't have a mangement firware
that actually provides so many interrupt lines to a single
device we're currently safe but that's about to change soon.

The new maximum is hence changed:
  - For RoCE devices, the limit would remain 64.
  - For non-RoCE devices, the limit might be higher [depending
    on the actual configuration of the device].
qed would start enforcing that limit in both scenarios.
