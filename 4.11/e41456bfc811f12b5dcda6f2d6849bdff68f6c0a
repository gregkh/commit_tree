drm/exynos: g2d: prevent integer overflow in

The size computations done in the ioctl function use an integer.
If userspace submits a request with req->cmd_nr or req->cmd_buf_nr
set to INT_MAX, the integer computations overflow later, leading
to potential (kernel) memory corruption.

Prevent this issue by enforcing a limit on the number of submitted
commands, so that we have enough headroom later for the size
computations.

Note that this change has no impact on the currently available
users in userspace, like e.g. libdrm/exynos.

While at it, also make a comment about the size computation more
detailed.
