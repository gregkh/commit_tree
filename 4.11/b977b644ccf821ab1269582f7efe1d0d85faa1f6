sunrpc: Allow xprt->ops->timer method to sleep

The transport lock is needed to protect the xprt_adjust_cwnd() call
in xs_udp_timer, but it is not necessary for accessing the
rq_reply_bytes_recvd or tk_status fields. It is correct to sublimate
the lock into UDP's xs_udp_timer method, where it is required.

The ->timer method has to take the transport lock if needed, but it
can now sleep safely, or even call back into the RPC scheduler.

This is more a clean-up than a fix, but the "issue" was introduced
by my transport switch patches back in 2005.
