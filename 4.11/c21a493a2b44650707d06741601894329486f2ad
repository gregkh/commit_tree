powerpc/xmon: Fix data-breakpoint

Currently xmon data-breakpoint feature is broken.

Whenever there is a watchpoint match occurs, hw_breakpoint_handler will
be called by do_break via notifier chains mechanism. If watchpoint is
registered by xmon, hw_breakpoint_handler won't find any associated
perf_event and returns immediately with NOTIFY_STOP. Similarly, do_break
also returns without notifying to xmon.

Solve this by returning NOTIFY_DONE when hw_breakpoint_handler does not
find any perf_event associated with matched watchpoint, rather than
NOTIFY_STOP, which tells the core code to continue calling the other
breakpoint handlers including the xmon one.
