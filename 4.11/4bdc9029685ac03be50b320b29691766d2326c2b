iio: bmg160: reset chip when probing

The gyroscope chip might need to be reset to be used.

Without the chip being reset, the driver stopped at the first
regmap_read (to get the CHIP_ID) and failed to probe.

The datasheet of the gyroscope says that a minimum wait of 30ms after
the reset has to be done.

This patch has been checked on a BMX055 and the datasheet of the BMG160
and the BMI055 give the same reset register and bits.
