powerpc/pseries: Introduce memory hotplug READD operation

Currently, memory must be hot removed and subsequently re-added in order
to dynamically update the affinity of LMBs specified by a PRRN event.
Earlier implementations of the PRRN event handler ran into issues in which
the hot remove would occur successfully, but a hotplug event would be
initiated from another source and grab the hotplug lock preventing the hot
add from occurring. To prevent this situation, this patch introduces the
notion of a hot "readd" action for memory which atomizes a hot remove and
a hot add into a single, serialized operation on the hotplug queue.
