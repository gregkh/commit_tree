i2c: acpi: Initialize info.type from of_compatible

When using devicetree i2c_board_info.type is set to the compatible
string with the vendor prefix removed. For I2C devices described via
ACPI the i2c_board_info.type string is set to the ACPI device name. When
using ACPI and DT ids this string ends up something like "PRP0001:00".

If the of_compatible property is present try to use that instead. This
makes it easier to instantiate i2c drivers through ACPI with DT ids.
