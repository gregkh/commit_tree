iw_cxgb4: Guard against null cm_id in dump_ep/qp

Endpoints that are aborting can have already dereferenced the
cm_id and set ep->com.cm_id to NULL.  So guard against that in
dump_ep() and dump_qp().

Also create a common function for setting up ip address pointers
since the same logic is needed in several places.
