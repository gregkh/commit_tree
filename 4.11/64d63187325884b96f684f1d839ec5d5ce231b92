scsi: hisi_sas: lock sensitive regions when servicing CQ interrupt

There is a bug in the current driver in that certain hisi_hba and port
structure elements which we access when servicing the CQ interrupt do
not use thread-safe accesses; these include hisi_sas_port linked-list of
active slots (hisi_sas_port.entry), bitmap of currently allocated IPTT
(in hisi_hba.slot_index_tags), and completion queue read pointer.

As a solution, lock these elements with the hisi_hba.lock.
