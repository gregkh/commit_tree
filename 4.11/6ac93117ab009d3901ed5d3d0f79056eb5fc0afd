blktrace: use existing disk debugfs directory

We may already have a directory to put the blktrace stuff in if

1. The disk uses blk-mq
2. CONFIG_BLK_DEBUG_FS is enabled
3. We are tracing the whole disk and not a partition

Instead of hardcoding this very specific case, let's use the new
debugfs_lookup(). If the directory exists, we use it, otherwise we
create one and clean it up later.
