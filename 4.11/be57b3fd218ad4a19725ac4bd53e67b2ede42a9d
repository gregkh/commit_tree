perf diff: Change default setting to "delta-abs"

The "delta-abs" compute method will show most changed entries on top.
So users can easily see how much effect between the data.  Note that it
also changes the default of -o option to 1 in order to apply the compute
method.  To see original-style (sorted by baseline) use -o 0 option.
