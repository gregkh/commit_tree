net: ipv6: send unsolicited NA if enabled for all interfaces

When arp_notify is set to 1 for either a specific interface or for 'all'
interfaces, gratuitous arp requests are sent. Since ndisc_notify is the
ipv6 equivalent to arp_notify, it should follow the same semantics.
Commit 4a6e3c5def13 ("net: ipv6: send unsolicited NA on admin up") sends
the NA on admin up. The final piece is checking devconf_all->ndisc_notify
in addition to the per device setting. Add it.
