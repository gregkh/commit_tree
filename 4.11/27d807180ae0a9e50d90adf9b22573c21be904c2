ISDN: eicon: reduce stack size of sig_ind function

I noticed that this function uses a lot of kernel stack when the
"latent entropy" plugin is enabled:

drivers/isdn/hardware/eicon/message.c: In function 'sig_ind':
drivers/isdn/hardware/eicon/message.c:6113:1: error: the frame size of 1168 bytes is larger than 1152 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

We currently don't warn about this, as we raise the warning limit
to 2048 bytes in mainline, but I'd like to lower that limit again
in the future, and this function can easily be changed to be more
efficient and avoid that warning, by making some of its local
variables 'const'.
