ahci: imx: fix building without hwmon or thermal

When CONFIG_HWMON is disabled, we now get a link failure:

ERROR: "devm_hwmon_device_register_with_groups" [drivers/ata/ahci_imx.ko] undefined!
drivers/ata/ahci_imx.o: In function `imx_ahci_probe':
ahci_imx.c:(.text.imx_ahci_probe+0x304): undefined reference to `devm_thermal_zone_of_sensor_register'

This makes the code calling into the hwmon subsystem compile-time
conditional, and adds a Kconfig dependency to avoid the corner
case of having HWMON=m and AHCI_IMX=y, by forcing AHCI_IMX=m in this
case. The thermal subsystem already has a check in its header, but
that also doesn't cover the THERMAL=m case, so we need a somewhat
complex Kconfig expression to handle all cases.
