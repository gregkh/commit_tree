scsi: aacraid: Fix for excessive prints on EEH

This issue showed up on a kdump debug(single CPU on powerkvm), when EEH
errors rendered the adapter unusable. The driver correctly detected the
issue and attempted to restart the controller, in doing so the driver
attempted to read the status registers of the controller. This triggered
additional eeh errors which continued for a good 6 minutes.

Fixed by returning without waiting when EEH error is reported.
