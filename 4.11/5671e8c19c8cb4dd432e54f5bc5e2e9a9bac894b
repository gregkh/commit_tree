fddi: skfp: Use more common logging styles

Several macros use non-standard styles where format and arguments
are not verified.  Convert these to a more typical fmt, ##__VA_ARGS__
use so format and arguments match as appropriate.

Miscellanea:

o Fix format and argument mismatches
o Realign and reindent misindented block
o Strip newlines from formats and add to macro defines
o Coalesce a few consecutive logging uses to more simple single uses
