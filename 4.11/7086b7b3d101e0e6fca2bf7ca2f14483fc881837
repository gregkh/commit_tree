ALSA: usb-audio: Tidy up mixer_us16x08.c

A few more cleanups and improvements that have been overlooked:

- Use ARRAY_SIZE() macro appropriately
- Code shuffling for minor optimization
- Omit superfluous variable initializations
- Get rid of superfluous NULL checks
- Add const to snd_us16x08_control_params definitions

No functional changes.
