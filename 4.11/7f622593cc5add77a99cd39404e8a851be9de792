ath10k: fix reading sram contents for QCA4019

With QCA4019 platform, SRAM address can be accessed directly from host but
currently, we are assuming sram addresses cannot be accessed directly and
hence we convert the addresses.

While there, clean up growing hw checks during conversion of target CPU
address to CE address. Now we have function pointer pertaining to different
chips.
