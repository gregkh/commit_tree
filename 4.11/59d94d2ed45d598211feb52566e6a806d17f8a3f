ARM: dts: watchdog0 cannot reliably trigger reset

On the Arria10, because of hardware bug, watchdog0 cannot reliably trigger
a reset to the CPU. The workaround would be to use watchdog1 instead.

Also for watchdog1, there is a dependency on the bootloader to enable the
boot_clk source to be from the cb_intosc_hs_clk/2, versus from EOSC1. This
corresponds to the (SWCTRLBTCLKEN & SWCTRLBTCLKSEL) bits enabled in the
control register in the clock manager module of Arria10.
