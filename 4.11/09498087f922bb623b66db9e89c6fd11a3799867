serial: 8250_dw: Honor clk_round_rate errors in dw8250_set_termios

clk_round_rate returns a signed long and may possibly return errors
in it, for example if there is no possible rate.

Till now dw8250_set_termios ignored any error, the signednes and would
just use the value as input to clk_set_rate. This of course falls apart
if there is an actual error, so check for errors and only try to set
a rate if the value is actually valid.

This turned up on some Rockchip platforms after commit
6a171b299379 ("serial: 8250_dw: Allow hardware flow control to be used")
enabled set_termios callback in all cases, not only ACPI.
