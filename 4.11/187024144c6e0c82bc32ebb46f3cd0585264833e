phy: marvell: remove conflicting initializer

One line was apparently pasted incorrectly during a new feature patch:

drivers/net/phy/marvell.c:2090:15: error: initialized field overwritten [-Werror=override-init]
   .features = PHY_GBIT_FEATURES,

I'm removing the extraneous line here to avoid the W=1 warning and restore
the previous flags value, and I'm slightly reordering the lines for consistency
to make it less likely to happen again in the future. The ordering in the
array is still not the same as in the structure definition, instead I picked
the order that is most common in this file and that seems to make more sense
here.
