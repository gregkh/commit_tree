x86/reboot/quirks: Fix typo in ASUS EeeBook X205TA reboot quirk

The reboot quirk for ASUS EeeBook X205TA contains a typo in
DMI_PRODUCT_NAME, improperly referring to X205TAW instead of
X205TA, which prevents the quirk from being triggered. The
model X205TAW already has a reboot quirk of its own.

This fix simply removes the inappropriate final letter W.
