bridge: resolve a false alarm of lockdep

Andrei reported a false alarm of lockdep at net/bridge/br_fdb.c:109,
this is because in Andrei's case, a spin_bug() was already triggered
before this, therefore the debug_locks is turned off, lockdep_is_held()
is no longer accurate after that. We should use lockdep_assert_held_once()
instead of lockdep_is_held() to respect debug_locks.
