USB: serial: ark3116: fix open error handling

Fix open error handling which failed to detect errors when reading the
MSR and LSR registers, something which could lead to the shadow
registers being initialised from errnos.

Note that calling the generic close implementation is sufficient in the
error paths as the interrupt urb has not yet been submitted and the
register updates have not been made.

and add close and release functions.")
