cpufreq: schedutil: Fix per-CPU structure initialization in sugov_start()

sugov_start() only initializes struct sugov_cpu per-CPU structures
for shared policies, but it should do that for single-CPU policies too.

That in particular makes the IO-wait boost mechanism work in the
cases when cpufreq policies correspond to individual CPUs.
