drm: qxl: Let DRM core handle connector registering

Registering the connector explicitly right after creation is not
necessary for modesetting drivers, because drm_dev_register already takes
care of this on the core side, by calling drm_modeset_register_all.

In addition, performing the initialization too early will get in the way
of the load() hook removal, because the connector interface cannot be
published prior to registering the minors.
