iio: Add gravity sensor support

Gravity sensor is a soft sensor, which derives value from
standard accelerometer device by filtering out the acceleration
which is not caused by gravity.

Gravity sensor provides a three dimensional vector indicating
the direction and magnitude of gravity. Typically, this sensor
is used to determine the device's relative orientation in space.
The units and the coordinate system is the same as the one used by
the acceleration sensor.
When a device is at rest, the output of the gravity sensor should
be identical to that of the accelerometer.

More information can be found in:

Gravity sensor and accelerometer have similar channels and
share channel usage ids. So the most of the code for accel_3d
can be reused.
