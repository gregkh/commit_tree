thermal: Fix potential deadlock in cpu_cooling

cooling_list_lock is covering not just cpufreq_dev_count, but also the
calls to cpufreq_register_notifier() and cpufreq_unregister_notifier().

Since cooling_list_lock is also used within cpufreq_thermal_notifier(),
lockdep reports a potential deadlock. Fix it by testing the condition
under cooling_list_lock and dropping the lock before calling
cpufreq_register_notifier(). And variable cpufreq_dev_count is removed
at the same time, because it's no longer needed after the fix.
