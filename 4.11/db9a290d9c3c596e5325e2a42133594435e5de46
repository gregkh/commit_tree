KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Rename kvm_alloc_hpt() for clarity

The difference between kvm_alloc_hpt() and kvmppc_alloc_hpt() is not at
all obvious from the name.  In practice kvmppc_alloc_hpt() allocates an HPT
by whatever means, and calls kvm_alloc_hpt() which will attempt to allocate
it with CMA only.

To make this less confusing, rename kvm_alloc_hpt() to kvm_alloc_hpt_cma().
Similarly, kvm_release_hpt() is renamed kvm_free_hpt_cma().
