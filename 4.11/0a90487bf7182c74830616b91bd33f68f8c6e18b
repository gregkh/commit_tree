xprtrdma: Handle stale connection rejection

A server rejects a connection attempt with STALE_CONNECTION when a
client attempts to connect to a working remote service, but uses a
QPN and GUID that corresponds to an old connection that was
abandoned. This might occur after a client crashes and restarts.

Fix rpcrdma_conn_upcall() to distinguish between a normal rejection
and rejection of stale connection parameters.

As an additional clean-up, remove the code that retries the
connection attempt with different ORD/IRD values. Code audit of
other ULP initiators shows no similar special case handling of
initiator_depth or responder_resources.
