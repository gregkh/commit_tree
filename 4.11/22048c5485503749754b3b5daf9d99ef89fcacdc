tools/power turbostat: bugfix: GFXMHz column not changing

turbostat displays a GFXMHz column, which comes from reading
/sys/class/graphics/fb0/device/drm/card0/gt_cur_freq_mhz

But GFXMHz was not changing, even when a manual
cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/device/drm/card0/gt_cur_freq_mhz
showed a new value.

It turns out that a rewind() on the open file is not sufficient,
fflush() (or a close/open) is needed to read fresh values.
