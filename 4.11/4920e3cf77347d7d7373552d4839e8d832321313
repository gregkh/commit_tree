s390: use correct input data address for setup_randomness

The current implementation of setup_randomness uses the stack address
and therefore the pointer to the SYSIB 3.2.2 block as input data
address. Furthermore the length of the input data is the number of
virtual-machine description blocks which is typically one.

This means that typically a single zero byte is fed to
add_device_randomness.

Fix both of these and use the address of the first virtual machine
description block as input data address and also use the correct
length.
