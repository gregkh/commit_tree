secure_seq: downgrade to per-host timestamp offsets

Unfortunately too many devices (not under our control) use tcp_tw_recycle=1,
which depends on timestamps being identical of the same saddr.

Although tcp_tw_recycle got removed in net-next we can't make
such end hosts disappear so downgrade to per-host timestamp offsets.
