usb: gadget: function: f_fs: pass companion descriptor along

If we're dealing with SuperSpeed endpoints, we need
to make sure to pass along the companion descriptor
and initialize fields needed by the Gadget
API. Eventually, f_fs.c should be converted to use
config_ep_by_speed() like all other functions,
though.
