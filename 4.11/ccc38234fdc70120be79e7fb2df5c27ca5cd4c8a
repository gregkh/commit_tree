mtd: bcm47xxsflash: support reading flash out of mapping window

For reading flash content we use MMIO but it's possible to read only
first 16 MiB this way. It's simply an arch design/limitation.
To support flash sizes bigger than 16 MiB implement indirect access
using ChipCommon registers.
This has been tested using MX25L25635F.
