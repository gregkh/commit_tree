ARM: defconfig: omap2plus: switch LIS3LV02DL driver

The OMAP2 plus defconfig lists the LIS3LC02D MISC driver
but there is nowadays a proper IIO driver for this accelerometer.
Switch the config to the new driver.

The IIO software triggers are helpful when using these devices
without a dedicated IRQ line, so activate those too.
