s390/sclp: make early sclp irq handler more robust

Make the early sclp interrupt handler more robust:

- disable all interrupt sub classes except for the service signal subclass
- extend ctlreg0 union so it is easily possible to set the service signal
  subclass mask bit without using a magic number
- disable lowcore protection before writing to it
- make sure that all write accesses are done before the original content
  of control register 0 is restored, which could enable lowcore protection
