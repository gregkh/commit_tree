tipc: modify struct tipc_plist to be more versatile

During multicast reception we currently use a simple linked list with
push/pop semantics to store port numbers.

We now see a need for a more generic list for storing values of type
u32. We therefore make some modifications to this list, while replacing
the prefix 'tipc_plist_' with 'u32_'. We also add a couple of new
functions which will come to use in the next commits.
