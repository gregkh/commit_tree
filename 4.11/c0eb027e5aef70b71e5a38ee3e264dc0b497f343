vfs: don't do RCU lookup of empty pathnames

Normal pathname lookup doesn't allow empty pathnames, but using
AT_EMPTY_PATH (with name_to_handle_at() or fstatat(), for example) you
can trigger an empty pathname lookup.

And not only is the RCU lookup in that case entirely unnecessary
(because we'll obviously immediately finalize the end result), it is
actively wrong.

Why? An empth path is a special case that will return the original
'dirfd' dentry - and that dentry may not actually be RCU-free'd,
resulting in a potential use-after-free if we were to initialize the
path lazily under the RCU read lock and depend on complete_walk()
finalizing the dentry.
