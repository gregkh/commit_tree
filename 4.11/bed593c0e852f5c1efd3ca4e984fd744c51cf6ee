crypto: arm64/aes - add scalar implementation

This adds a scalar implementation of AES, based on the precomputed tables
that are exposed by the generic AES code. Since rotates are cheap on arm64,
this implementation only uses the 4 core tables (of 1 KB each), and avoids
the prerotated ones, reducing the D-cache footprint by 75%.

On Cortex-A57, this code manages 13.0 cycles per byte, which is ~34% faster
than the generic C code. (Note that this is still >13x slower than the code
that uses the optional ARMv8 Crypto Extensions, which manages <1 cycles per
byte.)
