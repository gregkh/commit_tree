ASoC: core: Add API to use DMI name in sound card long name

Intel DSP platform drivers are used by many different devices but are
difficult for userspace to differentiate. This patch adds an API to allow
the DMI name to be used in the sound card long name, thereby helping
userspace load the correct UCM configuration. Usually machine drivers
uses their own name as the sound card name (short name), and leave the
long name and driver name blank. This API will use the DMI info like
vendor, product and board to make up the card long name. If the machine
driver has already explicitly set the long name, this API will do nothing.

This patch also allows for further differentiation as many devices that
share the same DMI name i.e. Minnowboards, UP boards may be configured
with different codecs or firmwares. The API supports flavoring the DMI
name into the card longname to provide the extra differentiation required
for these devices.

For Use Case Manager (UCM) in the user space, changing card long name by
this API is backward compatible, since the card name does not change. For
a given sound card, even if there is no device-specific UCM configuration
file that uses the card long name, UCM will fall back to load the default
configuration file that uses the card name.
