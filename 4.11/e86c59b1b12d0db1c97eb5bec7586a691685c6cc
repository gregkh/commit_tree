mm/ksm: improve deduplication of zero pages with colouring

Some architectures have a set of zero pages (coloured zero pages)
instead of only one zero page, in order to improve the cache
performance.  In those cases, the kernel samepage merger (KSM) would
merge all the allocated pages that happen to be filled with zeroes to
the same deduplicated page, thus losing all the advantages of coloured
zero pages.

This behaviour is noticeable when a process accesses large arrays of
allocated pages containing zeroes.  A test I conducted on s390 shows
that there is a speed penalty when KSM merges such pages, compared to
not merging them or using actual zero pages from the start without
breaking the COW.

This patch fixes this behaviour.  When coloured zero pages are present,
the checksum of a zero page is calculated during initialisation, and
compared with the checksum of the current canditate during merging.  In
case of a match, the normal merging routine is used to merge the page
with the correct coloured zero page, which ensures the candidate page is
checked to be equal to the target zero page.

A sysfs entry is also added to toggle this behaviour, since it can
potentially introduce performance regressions, especially on
architectures without coloured zero pages.  The default value is
disabled, for backwards compatibility.

With this patch, the performance with KSM is the same as with non
COW-broken actual zero pages, which is also the same as without KSM.
