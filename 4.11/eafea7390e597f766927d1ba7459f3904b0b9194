net: ipv4: remove disable of bottom half in inet_rtm_getroute

Nothing about the route lookup requires bottom half to be disabled.
Remove the local_bh_disable ... local_bh_enable around ip_route_input.
This appears to be a vestige of days gone by as it has been there
since the beginning of git time.
