ACPI / scan: Set the visited flag for all enumerated devices

Commit 10c7e20b2ff3 (ACPI / scan: fix enumeration (visited) flags for
bus rescans) attempted to fix a problem with ACPI-based enumerateion
of I2C/SPI devices, but it forgot to ensure that the visited flag
will be set for all of the other enumerated devices, so fix that.
