cgroup: cosmetic update to cgroup_taskset_add()

cgroup_taskset_add() was using list_add_tail() when for source csets
but list_move_tail() for destination.  As the operations are gated by
list_empty() test, list_move_tail() is equivalent to list_add_tail()
here.  Use list_add_tail() too for destination csets too.

This doesn't cause any functional changes.
