watchdog: mena21_wdt: Convert to use device managed functions and other improvements

Use device managed functions to simplify error handling, reduce
source code size, improve readability, and reduce the likelyhood of bugs.
Other improvements as listed below.

The conversion was done automatically with coccinelle using the
following semantic patches. The semantic patches and the scripts used
to generate this commit log are available at
https://github.com/groeck/coccinelle-patches

- Replace 'goto l; ... l: return e;' with 'return e;'
- Drop assignments to otherwise unused variables
- Drop remove function
- Drop unnecessary mutex_destroy() on allocated data
- Use devm_watchdog_register_driver() to register watchdog device
