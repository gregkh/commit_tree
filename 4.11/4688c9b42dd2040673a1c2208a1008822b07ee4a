EDAC, amd64: Don't treat ECC disabled as failure

Having ECC disabled on a node doesn't necessarily mean that it's
disabled for the entire system. So let's return a non-failing code when
ECC is disabled on a node. This way we can skip initialization for the
node but still continue with the remaining nodes.

After probing all instances, make sure we have at least one MC device
allocated.

This issue is seen and fix tested on Fam15h and Fam17h MCM systems.
