scsi: remove gfp_flags member in scsi_host_cmd_pool

When using the slab allocator we already decide at cache creation time if
an allocation comes from a GFP_DMA pool using the SLAB_CACHE_DMA flag,
and there is no point passing the kmalloc-family only GFP_DMA flag to
kmem_cache_alloc.  Drop all the infrastructure for doing so.
