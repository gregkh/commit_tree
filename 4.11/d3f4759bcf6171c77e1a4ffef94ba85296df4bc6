arm64: dts: marvell: Add DT for MACCHIATOBin board

Add a cut-down version of the DTS file for the community board
MACCHIATOBin from SolidRun based on Marvell Armada 8040 SoC to suit
the current mainlined Armada 8040 state.

This brings support for mainly SATA, SPI flash and UART.  The USB
descriptions are included but are not tested in this form due to the
lack of mainline GPIO.
