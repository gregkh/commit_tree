watchdog: coh901327_wdt: Keep clock enabled after loading driver

Enabling the clock before accessing chip registers and disabling it
afterwards does not really make sense and only adds complexity to
the driver. In addition to that, a comment int the driver suggests
that it does not serve a useful purpose either.

"The watchdog block is of course always clocked, the
 clk_enable()/clk_disable() calls are mainly for performing reference
 counting higher up in the clock hierarchy."

Just keep the clock enabled instead.
