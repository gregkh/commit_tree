PM / devfreq: Fix available_governor sysfs

The devfreq using passive governor is not able to change the governor.
So, the user can not change the governor through 'available_governor' sysfs
entry. Also, the devfreq which don't use the passive governor is not able to
change to 'passive' governor on the fly.
