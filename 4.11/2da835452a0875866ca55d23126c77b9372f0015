PM / Domains: Power off masters immediately in the power off sequence

Once a subdomain is powered off, genpd queues a power off work for each of
the subdomain's corresponding masters, thus postponing the masters to be
powered off to a later point.

When genpd used intermediate power off states, which was removed in
commit ba2bbfbf6307 ("PM / Domains: Remove intermediate states from the
power off sequence"), this behaviour made sense, but now it simply doesn't.

Genpd can easily try to power off the masters in the same context as the
subdomain, of course by acquiring/releasing the lock. Then, let's convert
to this behaviour, as it avoids unnecessary works from being queued.
