powerpc: Add a prototype for mcount() so it can be versioned

Currently we get a warning that _mcount() can't be versioned:

  WARNING: EXPORT symbol "_mcount" [vmlinux] version generation failed, symbol will not be versioned.

Add a prototype to asm-prototypes.h to fix it.

The prototype is not really correct, mcount() is not a normal function,
it has a special ABI. But for the purpose of versioning it doesn't
matter.
