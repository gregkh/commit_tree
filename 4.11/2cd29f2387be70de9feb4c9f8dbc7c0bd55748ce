gpio:mcp23s08 Fixed missing interrupts

When an interrupt occurs on an MCP23S08 chip, the INTF register will only
contain one bit as causing the interrupt.  If more than two pins change at
the same time on the chip, this causes one of the pins to not be reported.
This patch fixes the logic for checking if a pin has changed, so that
multiple pins will always cause more than one change.
