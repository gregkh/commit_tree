drm/armada: Fix compile fail

I reported the include issue for tracepoints a while ago, but nothing
seems to have happened. Now it bit us, since the drm_mm_print
conversion was broken for armada. Fix it, so I can re-enable armada
in the drm-misc build configs.

v2: Rebase just the compile fix on top of Chris' build fix.
