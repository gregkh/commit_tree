powerpc/mm: add radix__remove_section_mapping()

Tear down and free the four-level page tables of physical mappings
during memory hotremove.

Borrow the basic structure of remove_pagetable() and friends from the
identically-named x86 functions. Reduce the frequency of tlb flushes and
page_table_lock spinlocks by only doing them in the outermost function.
There was some question as to whether the locking is needed at all.
Leave it for now, but we could consider dropping it.

Memory must be offline to be removed, thus not in use. So there
shouldn't be the sort of concurrent page walking activity here that
might prompt us to use RCU.
