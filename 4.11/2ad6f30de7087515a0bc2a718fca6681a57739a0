ASoC: sun4i-i2s: Add quirks to handle a31 compatible

Some SoCs have a reset line that must be asserted/deasserted.
This patch adds a quirk to handle the new compatible
"allwinner,sun6i-a31-i2s" which will deassert the reset
line on probe function and assert it on remove's one.

This new compatible is useful in case of A33 codec driver, for example.
