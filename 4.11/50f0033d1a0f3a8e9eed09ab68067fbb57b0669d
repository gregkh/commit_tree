drm: Add some kselftests for the DRM range manager (struct drm_mm)

First we introduce a smattering of infrastructure for writing selftests.
The idea is that we have a test module that exercises a particular
portion of the exported API, and that module provides a set of tests
that can either be run as an ensemble via kselftest or individually via
an igt harness (in this case igt/drm_mm). To accommodate selecting
individual tests, we export a boolean parameter to control selection of
each test - that is hidden inside a bunch of reusable boilerplate macros
to keep writing the tests simple.

v2: Choose a random random_seed unless one is specified by the user.
v3: More parameters to control max_iterations and max_prime of the
tests.
