scsi: storvsc: properly set residual data length on errors

On I/O errors, the Windows driver doesn't set data_transfer_length
on error conditions other than SRB_STATUS_DATA_OVERRUN.
In these cases we need to set data_transfer_length to 0,
indicating there is no data transferred. On SRB_STATUS_DATA_OVERRUN,
data_transfer_length is set by the Windows driver to the actual data transferred.
