ASoC: soc-core: remove OF adjusting for snd_soc_of_parse_audio_prefix

Because prototype of OF-graph sound card support didn't have Sound Card
node, commit b6defcca0a604129155ae472b116a2e1688d8995
("ASoC: soc-core: adjust for graph on snd_soc_of_parse_audio_prefix")
adjusted to it on each functions.

But final discussion result of ALSA SoC / OF-graph ML, OF-graph sound
card has node. Thus, this commit became no longer needed.

This reverts commit b6defcca0a604129155ae472b116a2e1688d8995.
