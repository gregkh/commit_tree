PM / OPP: Take kref from _find_opp_table()

Take reference of the OPP table from within _find_opp_table(). Also
update the callers of _find_opp_table() to call
dev_pm_opp_put_opp_table() after they have used the OPP table.

Note that _find_opp_table() increments the reference under the
opp_table_lock.

Now that the OPP table wouldn't get freed until the callers of
_find_opp_table() call dev_pm_opp_put_opp_table(), there is no need to
take the opp_table_lock or rcu_read_lock() around it. Drop them.
