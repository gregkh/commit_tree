mlxsw: acl: Use PBS type for forward action

Current behaviour of "mirred redirect" action (forward) offload is a bit
odd. For matched packets the action forwards them to the desired
destination, but it also lets the packet duplicates to go the original
way down (bridge, router, etc). That is more like "mirred mirror".
Fix this by using PBS type which behaves exactly like "mirred redirect".
Note that PBS does not support loopback mode.
