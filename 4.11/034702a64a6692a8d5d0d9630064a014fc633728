xen/netfront: set default upper limit of tx/rx queues to 8

The default for the number of tx/rx queues of one interface is the
number of vcpus of the system today. As each queue pair reserves 512
grant pages this default consumes a ridiculous number of grants for
large guests.

Limit the queue number to 8 as default. This value can be modified
via a module parameter if required.
