bpf: split check_mem_access logic for map values

Move the logic to check memory accesses to a PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE_ADJ from
check_mem_access() to a separate helper check_map_access_adj(). This
enables to use those checks in other parts of the verifier as well,
where boundaries on PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE_ADJ might need to be checked, for
example when checking helper function arguments. The same thing is
already happening for other types such as PTR_TO_PACKET and its
check_packet_access() helper.

The code has been copied verbatim, with the only difference of removing
the "off += reg->max_value" statement and moving the sum into the call
statement to check_map_access(), as that was only needed due to the
earlier common check_map_access() call.
