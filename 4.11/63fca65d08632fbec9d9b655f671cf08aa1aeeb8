net: add confirm_neigh method to dst_ops

Add confirm_neigh method to dst_ops and use it from IPv4 and IPv6
to lookup and confirm the neighbour. Its usage via the new helper
dst_confirm_neigh() should be restricted to MSG_PROBE users for
performance reasons.

For XFRM prefer the last tunnel address, if present. With help
from Steffen Klassert.
