ARM: dts: NSP: DT Clean-ups

The QSPI entry was added out of the sequental order that the rest of the
DTSI file is in.  Move it to make it fit in properly.  Also, some other
entries have been added in a non-alphabetical order in the DTS files,
making them different from the other NSP DTS files.  Move the relevant
peices to make it match.  Finally, remove errant new lines.
