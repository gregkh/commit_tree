apparmor: provide userspace flag indicating binfmt_elf_mmap change

Commit 9f834ec18def ("binfmt_elf: switch to new creds when switching to new mm")
changed when the creds are installed by the binfmt_elf handler. This
affects which creds are used to mmap the executable into the address
space. Which can have an affect on apparmor policy.

Add a flag to apparmor at
/sys/kernel/security/apparmor/features/domain/fix_binfmt_elf_mmap

to make it possible to detect this semantic change so that the userspace
tools and the regression test suite can correctly deal with the change.
