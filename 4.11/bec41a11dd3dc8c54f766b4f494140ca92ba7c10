tcp: remove early retransmit

This patch removes the support of RFC5827 early retransmit (i.e.,
fast recovery on small inflight with <3 dupacks) because it is
subsumed by the new RACK loss detection. More specifically when
RACK receives DUPACKs, it'll arm a reordering timer to start fast
recovery after a quarter of (min)RTT, hence it covers the early
retransmit except RACK does not limit itself to specific inflight
or dupack numbers.
