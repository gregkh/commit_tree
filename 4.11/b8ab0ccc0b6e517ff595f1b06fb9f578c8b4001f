ASoC: Revert "samsung: Remove unneeded initialization of chan_name"

This reverts commit cdaf9af1eaeb539e32bfd6da6310b41ad6c3ba23
which breaks I2S support on the non-DT Samsung SoC platforms,
since the default "tx", "rx" DMA channel names for playback
and capture streams or custom channel names in struct
snd_dmaengine_pcm_config are supported in the ASoC dmaengine
module only for devicetree booting case.
