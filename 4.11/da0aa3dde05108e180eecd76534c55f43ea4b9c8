x86/microcode/AMD: Remove struct cont_desc.eq_id

The equivalence ID was needed outside of the container scanning logic
but now, after this has been cleaned up, not anymore. Now, cont_desc.mc
is used to denote whether the container we're looking at has the proper
microcode patch for this CPU or not.
