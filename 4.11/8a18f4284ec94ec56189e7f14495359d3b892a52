platform: Print the resource range if device failed to claim

Sometimes we have the following error message:
 platform MSFT0101:00: failed to claim resource 1
 acpi MSFT0101:00: platform device creation failed: -16
But there is not enough information to figure out which resource range
failed to claim.

Thus print the resource range at first-place thus /proc/iomem or
ioports should tell us who already claimed this resource, then
the driver bug or incorrect resource assignment which is running
into this conflict can be diagnosed:
 platform MSFT0101:00: failed to claim resource 1: [mem 0xfed40000-0xfed40fff]
 acpi MSFT0101:00: platform device creation failed: -16
