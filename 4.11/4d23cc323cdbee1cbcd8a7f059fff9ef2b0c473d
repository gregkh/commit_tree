tpm: add securityfs support for TPM 2.0 firmware event log

Unlike the device driver support for TPM 1.2, the TPM 2.0 does
not support the securityfs pseudo files for displaying the
firmware event log.

This patch enables support for providing the TPM 2.0 event log in
binary form. TPM 2.0 event log supports a crypto agile format that
records multiple digests, which is different from TPM 1.2. This
patch enables the tpm_bios_log_setup for TPM 2.0  and adds the
event log parser which understand the TPM 2.0 crypto agile format.
