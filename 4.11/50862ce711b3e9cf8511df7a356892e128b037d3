slab: remove slub sysfs interface files early for empty memcg caches

With kmem cgroup support enabled, kmem_caches can be created and
destroyed frequently and a great number of near empty kmem_caches can
accumulate if there are a lot of transient cgroups and the system is not
under memory pressure.  When memory reclaim starts under such
conditions, it can lead to consecutive deactivation and destruction of
many kmem_caches, easily hundreds of thousands on moderately large
systems, exposing scalability issues in the current slab management
code.  This is one of the patches to address the issue.

Each cache has a number of sysfs interface files under /sys/kernel/slab.
On a system with a lot of memory and transient memcgs, the number of
interface files which have to be removed once memory reclaim kicks in
can reach millions.
