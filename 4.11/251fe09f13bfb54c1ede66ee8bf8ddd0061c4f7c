iwlwifi: mvm: writing zero bytes to debugfs causes a crash

This is a static analysis fix.  The warning is:

	drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/mvm/fw-dbg.c:912 iwl_mvm_fw_dbg_collect()
	warn: integer overflows 'sizeof(*desc) + len'

I guess this code is supposed to take a NUL character, but if we write
zero bytes then it tries to write -1 characters and crashes.
