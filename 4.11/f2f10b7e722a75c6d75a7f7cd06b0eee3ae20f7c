HID: chicony: Add support for another ASUS Zen AiO keyboard

Add support for media keys on the keyboard that comes with the
Asus V221ID and ZN241IC All In One computers.

The keys to support here are WLAN, BRIGHTNESSDOWN and BRIGHTNESSUP.

This device is not visibly branded as Chicony, and the USB Vendor ID
suggests that it is a JESS device. However this seems like the right place
to put it: the usage codes are identical to the currently supported
devices, and this driver already supports the ASUS AIO keyboard AK1D.
