dmaengine: ipu: Make sure the interrupt routine checks all interrupts.

Commit 3d8cc00073d6 ("dmaengine: ipu: Consolidate duplicated irq handlers")
consolidated the two interrupts routines into one, but the remaining
interrupt routine only checks the status of the error interrupts, not the
normal interrupts.

This patch fixes that problem (tested on i.MX31 PDK board).
