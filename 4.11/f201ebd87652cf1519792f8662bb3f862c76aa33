mm/z3fold.c: limit first_num to the actual range of possible buddy indexes

At present, Tying the first_num size to NCHUNKS_ORDER is confusing.  the
number of chunks is completely unrelated to the number of buddies.

The patch limits the first_num to actual range of possible buddy indexes.
and that is more reasonable and obvious without functional change.
