watchdog: wm831x_wdt: Convert to use device managed functions

Use device managed functions to simplify error handling, reduce
source code size, improve readability, and reduce the likelyhood of bugs.

The conversion was done automatically with coccinelle using the
following semantic patches. The semantic patches and the scripts used
to generate this commit log are available at
https://github.com/groeck/coccinelle-patches

- Replace 'goto l; ... l: return e;' with 'return e;'
- Replace 'val = e; return val;' with 'return e;'
- Drop assignments to otherwise unused variables
- Replace 'if (e) { return expr; }' with 'if (e) return expr;'
- Drop remove function
- Drop platform_set_drvdata()
- Use devm_watchdog_register_driver() to register watchdog device
