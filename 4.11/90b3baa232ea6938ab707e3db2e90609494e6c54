s390: proper type casts for csum_partial invocations

Keep sparse and other static code checkers from emitting warnings like:

arch/s390/kernel/ipl.c:1549:14: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
arch/s390/kernel/ipl.c:1549:14:    expected unsigned int [unsigned] csum
arch/s390/kernel/ipl.c:1549:14:    got restricted __wsum

All usages in s390 code are ok. Therefore add proper casts.
