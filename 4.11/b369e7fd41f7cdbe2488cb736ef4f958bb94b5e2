tcp: make TCP_INFO more consistent

tcp_get_info() has to lock the socket, so lets lock it
for an extended critical section, so that various fields
have consistent values.

This solves an annoying issue that some applications
reported when multiple counters are updated during one
particular rx/rx event, and TCP_INFO was called from
another cpu.
