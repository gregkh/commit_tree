powerpc/pseries: Update affinity for memory and cpus specified in a PRRN event

Extend the existing PRRN infrastructure to perform the actual affinity
updating for cpus and memory in addition to the device tree updating.
For cpus, dynamic affinity updating already appears to exist in the
kernel in the form of arch_update_cpu_topology(). For memory, we must
place a READD operation on the hotplug queue for any phandle included in
the PRRN event that is determined to be an LMB.
