drm: kselftest for drm_mm_replace_node()

Reuse drm_mm_insert_node() with a temporary node to exercise
drm_mm_replace_node(). We use the previous test in order to exercise the
various lists following replacement.

v2: Check that we copy across the important (user) details of the node.
The internal details (such as lists and hole tracking) we hope to detect
errors by exercise.
