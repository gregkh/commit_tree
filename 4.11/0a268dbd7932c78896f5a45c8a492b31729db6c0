cgroup: move cgroup v1 specific code to kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c

cgroup.c is getting too unwieldy.  Let's move out cgroup v1 specific
code along with the debug controller into kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c.

v2: cgroup_mutex and css_set_lock made available in cgroup-internal.h
    regardless of CONFIG_PROVE_RCU.
