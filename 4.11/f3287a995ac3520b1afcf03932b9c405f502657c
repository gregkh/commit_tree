HID: multitouch: fix LG Melfas touchscreen

The LG Melfas touchscreen has a bad firmware where it declares the Contact ID
field as constant while it shouldn't. This messes up the autodetection and the
reporting of the events by hid-multitouch given that hid-input ignores constant
fields.

The autodetection is simply worked around by manually adding the device to
hid_have_special_driver[].

The processing of the events requires either a report fixup, or some specific
case handling. Given that the report fixup would require to basically rewrite
all the report descriptor, I went for the programatic way of fixing that after
the report descriptors are loaded.
