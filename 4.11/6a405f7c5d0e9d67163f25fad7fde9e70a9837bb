dt-bindings: Add Tegra186 BPMP I2C binding

In Tegra186, the BPMP (Boot and Power Management Processor) owns certain
HW devices, such as the I2C controller for the power management I2C bus.
Software running on other CPUs must perform IPC to the BPMP in order to
execute transactions on that I2C bus. This binding describes an I2C bus
that is accessed in such a fashion.
