IB/ipoib: Fix deadlock over vlan_mutex

This patch fixes Deadlock while executing ipoib_vlan_delete.

The function takes the vlan_rwsem semaphore and calls
unregister_netdevice. The later function calls
ipoib_mcast_stop_thread that cause workqueue flush.

When the queue has one of the ipoib_ib_dev_flush_xxx events,
a deadlock occur because these events also tries to catch the
same vlan_rwsem semaphore.

To fix, unregister_netdevice should be called after releasing
the semaphore.
