rcu: Design documentation for expedited grace periods

This commit adds design documentation for expedited grace periods.
This documentation is in HTML rather than the new documentation
format because (1) I have prototype documentation already in HTML,
and (2) Attempting to learn the new documentation format while
creating the design documentation seems likely to result in neither
happening in a timely fashion.

Once the design documentation is complete, we can start a conversion effort.
