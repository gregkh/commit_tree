sunrpc: flag transports as having congestion control

NFSv4 requires a transport protocol with congestion control in most
cases.

On an IP network, that means that NFSv4 over UDP should be forbidden.

The situation with RDMA is a bit more nuanced, but most RDMA transports
are suitable for this. For now, we assume that all RDMA transports are
suitable, but we may need to revise that at some point.
