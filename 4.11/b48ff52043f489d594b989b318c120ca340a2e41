Documentation:powerpc: Add device-tree bindings for power-mgt

Document the device-tree bindings defining the the properties under
the @power-mgt node in the device tree that describe the idle states
for Linux running on baremetal POWER servers.

These bindings are documented separately instead of using the the
common idle state bindings since the idle-states on POWER servers
are exposed as property arrays where as the common idle state bindings
expect idle-states to be described as nodes.
