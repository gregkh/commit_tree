ARM: 8655/1: improve NOMMU definition of pgprot_*()

The tegra DRM driver produces a harmless warning when built for NOMMU:

drivers/gpu/drm/tegra/gem.c: In function 'tegra_drm_mmap':
drivers/gpu/drm/tegra/gem.c:508:12: unused variable 'prot'

This is because pgprot_writecombine() on ARM returns a constant and
ignores its argument. The version in asm-generic doesn't have that
problem, so let's use that one instead. We don't actually care
about the value on NOMMU, and this is consistent with what some
other architectures do.
