gpiolib: Switch to for_each_set_bit()

The macro for_each_set_bit() effectively looks up to the next
set bit in array of bits.

Instead of open coding that switch to for_each_set_bit() in
gpio_chip_set_multiple().

While here, make gpio_chip_set_multiple() non-destructive
against its parameters. We are safe since all callers, i.e.
gpiod_set_array_value_complex(), handle that already.
