PCI: dwc: designware: Get device pointer at the start of dw_pcie_host_init()

No functional change. Get device pointer at the beginning of
dw_pcie_host_init() instead of getting it all over dw_pcie_host_init().
This is in preparation for splitting struct pcie_port into host and core
structures (once split pcie_port will not have device pointer).
