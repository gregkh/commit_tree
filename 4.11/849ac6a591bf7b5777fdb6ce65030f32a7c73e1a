scsi: aacraid: Skip wellness sync on controller failure

aac_command_thread checks on the health of controller periodically,
using aac_check_health. If the status is an error state KERNEL_PANIC or
anything else. The driver will attempt to restart the adapter, but the
response is not checked in aac_command_thread. This allows the periodic
sync to go thru and lead the driver to a hung state.

Fixed by terminating the periodic loop(intended per original design),
if the controller is not restored to a healthy state.
