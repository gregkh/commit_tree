sparc64: kern_addr_valid regression

I encountered this bug when using /proc/kcore to examine the kernel. Plus a
coworker inquired about debugging tools. We computed pa but did
not use it during the maximum physical address bits test. Instead we used
the identity mapped virtual address which will always fail this test.

I believe the defect came in here:
[bpicco@zareason linus.git]$ git describe --contains bb4e6e85daa52
v3.18-rc1~87^2~4
