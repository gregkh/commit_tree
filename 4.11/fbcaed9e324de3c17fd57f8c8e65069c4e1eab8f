staging: vc04_services: Add vchi_queue_kernel_message function

The vchi_msg_queue function which is used by other drivers
to queue a message is difficult to understand and overly
generic.

Add a new function which is a wrapper on top of vchi_msg_queue
that is specifically for queuing a message located in kernel
address space.

int
vchi_queue_kernel_message(VCHI_SERVICE_HANDLE_T handle,
			  void *data,
			  unsigned int size)
