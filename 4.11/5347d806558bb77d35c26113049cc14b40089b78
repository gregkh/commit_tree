ARM: dts: at91: add dts file for sama5d36ek CMP board

The sama5d36ek CMP board is the variant of sama5d3xek board.
It is equipped with the low-power DDR2 SDRAM, PMIC ACT8865 and
some power rail. Its main purpose is used to measure the power
consumption.
The difference of the sama5d36ek CMP dts from sama5d36ek dts is
listed as below.
 1. The USB host nodes are removed, that is, the USB host is disabled.
 2. The gpio_keys node is added to wake up from the sleep.
 3. The LCD isn't supported due to the pins for LCD are conflicted
    with gpio_keys.
 4. The adc0 node support the pinctrl sleep state to fix the over
    consumption on VDDANA.

As said in errata, "When the USB host ports are used in high speed
mode (EHCI), it is not possible to suspend the ports if no device is
attached on each port. This leads to increased power consumption even
if the system is in a low power mode." That is why the the USB host
is disabled.
