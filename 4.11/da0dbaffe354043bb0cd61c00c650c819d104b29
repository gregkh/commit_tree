mmc: block: inline command abortions

Setting rqc to NULL followed by a goto to cmd_abort is just a way
to do unconditional abort without starting any new command.
Inline the calls to mmc_blk_rw_cmd_abort() and return immediately
in those cases.

Add some comments to the code flow so it is clear that this is
where the asynchronous requests come back in and the result of
them gets handled.
