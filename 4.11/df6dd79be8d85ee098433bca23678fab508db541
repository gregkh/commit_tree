mlxsw: spectrum_router: Don't reflect LINKDOWN nexthops

The kernel resolves the nexthops for a given route using
FIB_LOOKUP_IGNORE_LINKSTATE which means a notification can be sent for a
route with one of its nexthops being LINKDOWN.

In case IGNORE_ROUTES_WITH_LINKDOWN is set for the nexthop netdev, then
we shouldn't reflect the nexthop to the device's table.

Once the nexthop netdev's carrier goes up we'll be notified using NH_ADD
and reflect it to the device.
