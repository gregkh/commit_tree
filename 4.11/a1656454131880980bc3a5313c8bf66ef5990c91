Drivers: hv: vmbus: Use all supported IC versions to negotiate

Previously, we were assuming that each IC protocol version was tied to a
specific host version. For example, some Windows 10 preview hosts only
support v3 TimeSync even though driver assumes v4 is supported by all
Windows 10 hosts.

The guest will stop trying to negotiate even though older supported
versions may still be offered by the host.

Make IC version negotiation more robust by going through all versions
that are supported by the guest.

version and protocol to use")
