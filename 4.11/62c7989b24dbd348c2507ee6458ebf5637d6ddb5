bpf: allow b/h/w/dw access for bpf's cb in ctx

When structs are used to store temporary state in cb[] buffer that is
used with programs and among tail calls, then the generated code will
not always access the buffer in bpf_w chunks. We can ease programming
of it and let this act more natural by allowing for aligned b/h/w/dw
sized access for cb[] ctx member. Various test cases are attached as
well for the selftest suite. Potentially, this can also be reused for
other program types to pass data around.
