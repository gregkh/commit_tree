drm/exynos: remove unnecessary codes

This patch removes exynos_drm_crtc_cancel_page_flip call
when drm is closed because at that time, events will be released
by drm_events_release function.

Changelog v1:
- remove exynos_drm_crtc_cancel_page_flip function also because
  this funtion isn't used anymore.
