[media] staging: lirc_imon: port remaining usb ids to imon and remove

The staging lirc_imon driver contains 4 usb ids. Two of those have a VFD
and two don't. The VFD code is exactly the same in the mainline imon
driver, so that part is easily ported.

The staging driver produces raw IR rather than scancodes for the four
devices, so I've ported the raw IR code from staging to mainline imon.

Now that mainline imon can handle these four devices, lirc_imon is no
longer needed.

Compile tested only.
