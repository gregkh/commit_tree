ASoC: hdac_hdmi: Add support for multiple ports to a PCM

Since we have the MST feature enabled and Pin-Port mux for user to
select the converter routing, multiple port mapping to same converter
needs to be supported.

To support multiple port mapped to same converter following changes are
done for this:.
o Add port list to pcm, so that multiple ports can be mapped to a PCM.
o Jack reporting in case where multiple port are attached to same PCM.
o Change hdac_hdmi_get_port_from_cvt(), channel_map, remove functions
to parse through all ports mapped to same the PCM.
