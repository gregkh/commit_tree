tty_port: Add port client functions

Introduce a client (upward direction) operations struct for tty_port
clients. Initially supported operations are for receiving data and write
wake-up. This will allow for having clients other than an ldisc.

Convert the calls to the ldisc to use the client ops as the default
operations.
