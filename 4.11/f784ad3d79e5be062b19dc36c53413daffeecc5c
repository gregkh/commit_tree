ipv6: do not send RTM_DELADDR for tentative addresses

RTM_NEWADDR notification is sent when IFA_F_TENTATIVE is cleared from
the address. So if the address is added and deleted before DAD probes
completes, the RTM_DELADDR will be sent for which there was no
RTM_NEWADDR causing asymmetry in notification. However if the same
logic is used while sending RTM_DELADDR notification, this asymmetry
can be avoided.
