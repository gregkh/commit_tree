regulator: tps65217: Allow DCDC1 and DCDC3 up to 3.3V

The data sheet statement that DCDC1 and DCDC3 only can be set in the range
0.9V - 1.5V refers to storage on its internal EEPROM and therefore cold boot
configuration. After power-on the device can be reconfigured over i2c and
DCDC1/3 set up to 3.3V.
