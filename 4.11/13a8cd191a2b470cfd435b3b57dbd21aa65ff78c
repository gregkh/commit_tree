i40e: Do not enable NAPI on q_vectors that have no rings

When testing the epoll w/ busy poll code I found that I could get into a
state where the i40e driver had q_vectors w/ active NAPI that had no rings.
This was resulting in a divide by zero error.  To correct it I am updating
the driver code so that we only support NAPI on q_vectors that have 1 or
more rings allocated to them.
