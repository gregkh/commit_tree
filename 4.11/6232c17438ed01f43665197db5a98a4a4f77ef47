rt2x00: avoid introducing a USB dependency in the rt2x00lib module

As reported by Felix:

Though protected by an ifdef, introducing an usb symbol dependency in
the rt2x00lib module is a major inconvenience for distributions that
package kernel modules split into individual packages.

Get rid of this unnecessary dependency by calling the usb related
function from a more suitable place.
