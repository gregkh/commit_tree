HID: wacom: call _query_tablet_data() for BAMBOO_TOUCH

Commit a544c619a54b ("HID: wacom: do not attempt to switch mode
while in probe") introduces delayed work for querying (setting the
mode) on all tablets. Bamboo Touch (056a:00d0) has a ghost
interface which claims to be a pen device. Though this device can
be removed, we have to set the mode on the ghost pen interface
before we remove it. After the aforementioned delay was introduced
the device was being removed before the mode setting could be
executed.
