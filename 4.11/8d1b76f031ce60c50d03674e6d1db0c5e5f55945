dmaengine: stm32-dma: Rework starting transfer management

This patch reworks the way to manage transfer starting.
Now, starting DMA is only allowed when the channel is not busy.
Then, stm32_dma_start_transfer is declared as void.
At least, after each transfer completion, we start the next transfer if a
new descriptor as been queued in the issued list during an ongoing
transfer.
