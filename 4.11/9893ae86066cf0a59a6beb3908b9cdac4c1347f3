platform/x86: dell-smbios: Auto-select as needed

Dell-smbios is a helper module, it serves no purpose on its own, so
do not present it as an option to the user. Instead, select it
automatically whenever a driver which needs it is selected.

Also select DCDBAS as needed, instead of depending on it, so that
the Dell driver options are always visible.

As a clean-up, I removed the "default n" statements as they are not
needed (n is the default default.)
