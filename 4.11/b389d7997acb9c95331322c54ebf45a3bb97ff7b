arm64: cpufeature: treat unknown fields as RES0

Any fields not defined in an arm64_ftr_bits entry are propagated to the
system-wide register value in init_cpu_ftr_reg(), and while we require
that these strictly match for the sanity checks, we don't update them in
update_cpu_ftr_reg().

Generally, the lack of an arm64_ftr_bits entry indicates that the bits
are currently RES0 (as is the case for the upper 32 bits of all
supposedly 32-bit registers).

A better default would be to use zero for the system-wide value of
unallocated bits, making all register checking consistent, and allowing
for subsequent simplifications to the arm64_ftr_bits arrays.

This patch updates init_cpu_ftr_reg() to treat unallocated bits as RES0
for the purpose of the system-wide safe value. These bits will still be
sanity checked with strict match requirements, as is currently the case.
