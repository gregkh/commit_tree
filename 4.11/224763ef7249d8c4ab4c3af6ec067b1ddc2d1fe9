rtc: stm32: fix building without CONFIG_OF

The new driver has a stray #ifdef in it that causes a build error:

drivers/rtc/rtc-stm32.c:718:21: error: 'stm32_rtc_of_match' undeclared here (not in a function); did you mean 'stm32_rtc_pm_ops'?

As the #ifdef serves no purpose here, let's just remove it.
