tipc: Fix missing connection request handling

In filter_connect, we use waitqueue_active() to check for any
connections to wakeup. But waitqueue_active() is missing memory
barriers while accessing the critical sections, leading to
inconsistent results.

In this commit, we replace this with an SMP safe wq_has_sleeper()
using the generic socket callback sk_data_ready().
