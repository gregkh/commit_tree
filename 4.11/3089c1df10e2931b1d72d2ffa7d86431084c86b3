drm/ttm: fix use-after-free races in vm fault handling

The vm fault handler relies on the fact that the VMA owns a reference
to the BO. However, once mmap_sem is released, other tasks are free to
destroy the VMA, which can lead to the BO being freed. Fix two code
paths where that can happen, both related to vm fault retries.

Found via a lock debugging warning which flagged &bo->wu_mutex as
locked while being destroyed.
