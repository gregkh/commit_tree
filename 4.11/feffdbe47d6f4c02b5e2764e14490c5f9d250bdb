i40e: rename i40e_put_mac_in_vlan and i40e_del_mac_all_vlan

These functions purpose is to add a new MAC filter correctly, whether
we're using VLANs or not. Their goal is to ensure that all active VLANs
get the new MAC filter. Rename them so that their intent is clear. They
function correctly regardless of whether we have any active VLANs or
only have I40E_VLAN_ANY filters. The new names convey how they function
in a more clear manner.
