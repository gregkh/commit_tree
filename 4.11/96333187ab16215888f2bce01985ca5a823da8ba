userfaultfd_copy: return -ENOSPC in case mm has gone

In the non-cooperative userfaultfd case, the process exit may race with
outstanding mcopy_atomic called by the uffd monitor.  Returning -ENOSPC
instead of -EINVAL when mm is already gone will allow uffd monitor to
distinguish this case from other error conditions.
