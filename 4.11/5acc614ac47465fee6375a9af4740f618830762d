drm: Protect master->unique with dev->master_mutex

No one looks at the major/minor versions except the unique/busid
stuff. If we protect that with the master_mutex (since it also affects
the unique of each master, oh well) we can mark these two IOCTL with
DRM_UNLOCKED.

While doing this I realized that the comment for the magic_map is
outdated, I've forgotten to update it in:
