drm/i915: Fix tracepoint compilation

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/./i915_trace.h: In function ‘trace_event_raw_event_i915_gem_evict’:
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/./i915_trace.h:409:24: error: ‘struct i915_address_space’ has no member named ‘dev’
       __entry->dev = vm->dev->primary->index;

A couple of macros missed in the s/vm->dev/vm->i915/ conversion.

Fixes: 49d73912cbfc ("drm/i915: Convert vm->dev backpointer to vm->i915")
