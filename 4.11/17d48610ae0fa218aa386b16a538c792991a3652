KVM: PPC: Book 3S: XICS: Implement ICS P/Q states

This patch implements P(Presented)/Q(Queued) states for ICS irqs.

When the interrupt is presented, set P. Present if P was not set.
If P is already set, don't present again, set Q.
When the interrupt is EOI'ed, move Q into P (and clear Q). If it is
set, re-present.

The asserted flag used by LSI is also incorporated into the P bit.

When the irq state is saved, P/Q bits are also saved, they need some
qemu modifications to be recognized and passed around to be restored.
KVM_XICS_PENDING bit set and saved should also indicate
KVM_XICS_PRESENTED bit set and saved. But it is possible some old
code doesn't have/recognize the P bit, so when we restore, we set P
for PENDING bit, too.

The idea and much of the code come from Ben.
