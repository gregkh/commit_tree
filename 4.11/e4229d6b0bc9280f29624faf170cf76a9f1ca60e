xfs: fix eofblocks race with file extending async dio writes

It's possible for post-eof blocks to end up being used for direct I/O
writes. dio write performs an upfront unwritten extent allocation, sends
the dio and then updates the inode size (if necessary) on write
completion. If a file release occurs while a file extending dio write is
in flight, it is possible to mistake the post-eof blocks for speculative
preallocation and incorrectly truncate them from the inode. This means
that the resulting dio write completion can discover a hole and allocate
new blocks rather than perform unwritten extent conversion.

This requires a strange mix of I/O and is thus not likely to reproduce
in real world workloads. It is intermittently reproduced by generic/299.
The error manifests as an assert failure due to transaction overrun
because the aforementioned write completion transaction has only
reserved enough blocks for btree operations:

  XFS: Assertion failed: tp->t_blk_res_used <= tp->t_blk_res, \
   file: fs/xfs//xfs_trans.c, line: 309

The root cause is that xfs_free_eofblocks() uses i_size to truncate
post-eof blocks from the inode, but async, file extending direct writes
do not update i_size until write completion, long after inode locks are
dropped. Therefore, xfs_free_eofblocks() effectively truncates the inode
to the incorrect size.

Update xfs_free_eofblocks() to serialize against dio similar to how
extending writes are serialized against i_size updates before post-eof
block zeroing. Specifically, wait on dio while under the iolock. This
ensures that dio write completions have updated i_size before post-eof
blocks are processed.
