irqchip/gicv3-its: Add workaround for QDF2400 ITS erratum 0065

On Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies QDF2400 SoCs, the ITS hardware
implementation uses 16Bytes for Interrupt Translation Entry (ITE),
but reports an incorrect value of 8Bytes in GITS_TYPER.ITTE_size.

It might cause kernel memory corruption depending on the number
of MSI(x) that are configured and the amount of memory that has
been allocated for ITEs in its_create_device().

This patch fixes the potential memory corruption by setting the
correct ITE size to 16Bytes.
