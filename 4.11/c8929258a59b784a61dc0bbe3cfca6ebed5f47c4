Documentation/sphinx: make targets independent of Sphinx work for HAVE_SPHINX=0

Make targets that don't depend on Sphinx work without warnings about
missing Sphinx. 'make cleandocs' will work without Sphinx just fine, and
the targets that are no-ops for Sphinx should just be skipped. Move them
outside of the HAVE_SPHINX checks to take precedence over the .DEFAULT
target for HAVE_SPHINX=0.
