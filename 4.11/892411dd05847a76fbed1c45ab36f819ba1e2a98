ACPICA: Tools: Update common signon, remove compilation bit width

ACPICA commit 43e04e75a9849072a1557b674004d8093bddb9ef

Remove the bit width of the compiler that generated the tool
from the tool signon. This was confusing and unnecessary.

Changed the iASL signon to add "disassembler" to the name.
