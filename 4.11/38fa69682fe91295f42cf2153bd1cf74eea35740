dt-bindings: power: supply: add AXP20X/AXP22X AC power supply

The X-Powers AXP20X and AXP22X PMICs have an AC entry to supply power to
the board. They have a few registers dedicated to the status of the AC
power supply.

This adds the DT binding documentation for the AC power supply for
AXP20X and AXP22X PMICs.
