batman-adv: Treat NET_XMIT_CN as transmit successfully

The tc could return NET_XMIT_CN as one congestion notification, but
it does not mean the packet is lost. Other modules like ipvlan,
macvlan, and others treat NET_XMIT_CN as success too.

So batman-adv should handle NET_XMIT_CN also as NET_XMIT_SUCCESS.
