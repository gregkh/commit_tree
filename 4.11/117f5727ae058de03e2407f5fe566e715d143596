arm64: add missing printk newlines

A few printk calls in arm64 omit a trailing newline, even though there
is no subsequent KERN_CONT printk associated with them, and we actually
want a newline.

This can result in unrelated lines being appended, rather than appearing
on a new line. Additionally, timestamp prefixes may appear in-line. This
makes the logs harder to read than necessary.

Avoid this by adding a trailing newline.

These were found with a shortlist generated by:

$ git grep 'pr\(intk\|_.*\)(.*)' -- arch/arm64 | grep -v pr_fmt | grep -v '\\n"'
