KVM: x86: replace kvm_apic_id with kvm_{x,x2}apic_id

There were three calls sites:
 - recalculate_apic_map and kvm_apic_match_physical_addr, where it would
   only complicate implementation of x2APIC hotplug;
 - in apic_debug, where it was still somewhat preserved, but keeping the
   old function just for apic_debug was not worth it
