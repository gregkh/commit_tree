md/raid5-cache: exclude reclaiming stripes in reclaim check

stripes which are being reclaimed are still accounted into cached
stripes. The reclaim takes time. r5c_do_reclaim isn't aware of the
stripes and does unnecessary stripe reclaim. In practice, I saw one
stripe is reclaimed one time. This will cause bad IO pattern. Fixing
this by excluding the reclaing stripes in the check.
