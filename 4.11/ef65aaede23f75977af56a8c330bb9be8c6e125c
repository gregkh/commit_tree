smb2: Enforce sec= mount option

If the security type specified using a mount option is not supported,
the SMB2 session setup code changes the security type to RawNTLMSSP. We
should instead fail the mount and return an error.

The patch changes the code for SMB2 to make it similar to the code used
for SMB1. Like in SMB1, we now use the global security flags to select
the security method to be used when no security method is specified and
to return an error when the requested auth method is not available.

For SMB2, we also use ntlmv2 as a synonym for nltmssp.
