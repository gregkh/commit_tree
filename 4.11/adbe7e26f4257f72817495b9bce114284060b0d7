arm64: dma-mapping: Fix dma_mapping_error() when bypassing SWIOTLB

When bypassing SWIOTLB on small-memory systems, we need to avoid calling
into swiotlb_dma_mapping_error() in exactly the same way as we avoid
swiotlb_dma_supported(), because the former also relies on SWIOTLB state
being initialised.

Under the assumptions for which we skip SWIOTLB, dma_map_{single,page}()
will only ever return the DMA-offset-adjusted physical address of the
page passed in, thus we can report success unconditionally.
