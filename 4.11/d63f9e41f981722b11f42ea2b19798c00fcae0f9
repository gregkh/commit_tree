net: mvpp2: remove useless arguments in mvpp2_rx_{pkts, time}_coal_set

As noticed by Russell King, the last argument of
mvpp2_rx_{pkts,time}_coal_set() is useless, since the packet/time
coalescing value is already stored in the 'struct mvpp2_rx_queue *'
passed as argument to these functions. So passing the packet/time value
as an additional argument, and setting them again in the mvpp2_rx_queue
structure is useles.

This commit therefore gets rid of this additional argument, assuming the
caller has assigned the appropriate value to rxq->pkts_coal or
rxq->time_coal before calling the respective functions.
