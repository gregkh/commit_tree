nl80211: rework {sched_,}scan event related functions

A couple of functions used with scan events were named with
term "send" although they were only preparing the the event
message so renamed those.

Also remove nl80211_send_sched_scan_results() in favor of
just calling nl80211_send_sched_scan() with the right value.
