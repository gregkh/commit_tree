PM / devfreq: Don't delete sysfs group twice

The 'userspace' governor adds a sysfs entry, which is removed when
the governor is changed, or the devfreq device is released. However,
when the latter occurs via device_unregister(), device_del() is
called first, which removes the sysfs entries recursively and deletes
the kobject.

This means we get an Oops when the governor calls
sysfs_remove_group() on the deleted kobject. Fix this by only doing
the call when kobj *hasn't* been kobject_del()'d.

Note that we can't just remove the call to sysfs_remove_group()
entirely - it's needed for when the governor is changed to one which
doesn't need a sysfs entry.
