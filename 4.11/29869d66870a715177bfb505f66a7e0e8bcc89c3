tcp: Revert "tcp: tcp_probe: use spin_lock_bh()"

This reverts commit e70ac171658679ecf6bea4bbd9e9325cd6079d2b.

jtcp_rcv_established() is in fact called with hard irq being disabled.

Initial bug report from Ricardo Nabinger Sanchez [1] still needs
to be investigated, but does not look like a TCP bug.
