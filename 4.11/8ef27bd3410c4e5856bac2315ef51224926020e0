platform/x86: fujitsu-laptop: rename FUNC_RFKILL to FUNC_FLAGS

FUNC subfunction 0x1000 is currently referred to as FUNC_RFKILL, which
is misleading, because it handles more than just radio devices (also
lid, dock, LEDs).  Rename the FUNC_RFKILL constant to FUNC_FLAGS.
Replace "rfkill" with "flags" in the names of its associated fields
inside struct fujitsu_laptop.
