Smack: Fix the issue of permission denied error in ipv6 hook

Permission denied error comes when 2 IPv6 servers are running and client
tries to connect one of them. Scenario is that both servers are using same
IP and port but different protocols(Udp and tcp). They are using different
SMACK64IPIN labels.Tcp server is using "test" and udp server is using
"test-in". When we try to run tcp client with SMACK64IPOUT label as "test",
then connection denied error comes. It should not happen since both tcp
server and client labels are same.This happens because there is no check
for protocol in smk_ipv6_port_label() function while searching for the
earlier port entry. It checks whether there is an existing port entry on
the basis of port only. So it updates the earlier port entry in the list.
Due to which smack label gets changed for earlier entry in the
"smk_ipv6_port_list" list and permission denied error comes.

Now a check is added for socket type also.Now if 2 processes use same
port  but different protocols (tcp or udp), then 2 different port entries
will be  added in the list. Similarly while checking smack access in
smk_ipv6_port_check() function,  port entry is searched on the basis of
both port and protocol.
