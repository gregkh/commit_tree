MIPS: Ensure bss section ends on a long-aligned address

When clearing the .bss section in kernel_entry we do so using LONG_S
instructions, and branch whilst the current write address doesn't equal
the end of the .bss section minus the size of a long integer. The .bss
section always begins at a long-aligned address and we always increment
the write pointer by the size of a long integer - we therefore rely upon
the .bss section ending at a long-aligned address. If this is not the
case then the long-aligned write address can never be equal to the
non-long-aligned end address & we will continue to increment past the
end of the .bss section, attempting to zero the rest of memory.

Despite this requirement that .bss end at a long-aligned address we pass
0 as the end alignment requirement to the BSS_SECTION macro and thus
don't guarantee any particular alignment, allowing us to hit the error
condition described above.

Fix this by instead passing 8 bytes as the end alignment argument to
the BSS_SECTION macro, ensuring that the end of the .bss section is
always at least long-aligned.
