net: mvneta: add xmit_more support

Basing on xmit_more flag of the skb, TX descriptors can be concatenated
before flushing. This commit delay Tx descriptor flush if the queue is
running and if there is more skb's to send.

A maximum allowed number of descriptors for flushing at once due to
MVNETA_TXQ_UPDATE_REG(q) reqisters limitation, is 255. Because of that
a new macro was added (MVNETA_TXQ_DEC_SENT_MASK) in order to ensure that
concatenated amount of descriptor does not exceed that value.
