crypto: ccm - honour alignmask of subordinate MAC cipher

The CCM driver was recently updated to defer the MAC part of the algorithm
to a dedicated crypto transform, and a template for instantiating such
transforms was added at the same time.

However, this new cbcmac template fails to take the alignmask of the
encapsulated cipher into account, which may result in buffer addresses
being passed down that are not sufficiently aligned.

So update the code to ensure that the digest buffer in the desc ctx
appears at a sufficiently aligned offset, and tweak the code so that all
calls to crypto_cipher_encrypt_one() operate on this buffer exclusively.
