kvm: nVMX: Refactor handle_vmon()

Handle_vmon is split into two parts: the part that handles the VMXON
instruction, and the part that modifies the vcpu state to transition
from legacy mode to VMX operation. The latter will be used when
restoring the checkpointed state of a vCPU that was in VMX operation
when a snapshot was taken.
