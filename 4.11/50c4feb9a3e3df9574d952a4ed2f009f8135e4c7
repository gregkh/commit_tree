dm raid: be prepared to accept arbitrary '- -' tuples

During raid set resize checks and setting up the recovery offset in case a raid
set grows, calculated rd->md.dev_sectors is compared to rs->dev[0].rdev.sectors.

Device 0 may not be defined in case userspace passes in '- -' for it
(lvm2 doesn't do that so far), thus it's device sectors can't be taken
authoritatively in this comparison and another valid device must be used
to retrieve the device size.

Use mddev->dev_sectors in checking for ongoing recovery for the same reason.
