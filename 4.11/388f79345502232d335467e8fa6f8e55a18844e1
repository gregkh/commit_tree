mm: use mmget_not_zero() helper

We already have the helper, we can convert the rest of the kernel
mechanically using:

  git grep -l 'atomic_inc_not_zero.*mm_users' | xargs sed -i 's/atomic_inc_not_zero(&\(.*\)->mm_users)/mmget_not_zero\(\1\)/'

This is needed for a later patch that hooks into the helper, but might
be a worthwhile cleanup on its own.
