net: ipv4: fix multipath RTM_GETROUTE behavior when iif is given

inet_rtm_getroute synthesizes a skeletal ICMP skb, which is passed to
ip_route_input when iif is given. If a multipath route is present for
the designated destination, ip_multipath_icmp_hash ends up being called,
which uses the source/destination addresses within the skb to calculate
a hash. However, those are not set in the synthetic skb, causing it to
return an arbitrary and incorrect result.

Instead, use UDP, which gets no such special treatment.
