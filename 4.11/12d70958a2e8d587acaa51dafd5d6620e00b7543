blk-mq: don't fail allocating driver tag for stopped hw queue

We rely on blk_mq_get_driver_tag() not failing if 'wait' is true,
but it currently fails in that case if the queue happens to be
stopped at the time of the call.

We don't need to check for stopped here, it's just assigning
the tag. If the queue is stopped, we'll handle it when
attempting to run the queue.

This fixes a stall/crash on flush intensive workloads, where
we proceed to process a flush that doesn't have a valid tag
assigned.
