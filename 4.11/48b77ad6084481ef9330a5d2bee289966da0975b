block: cleanup tracing

A couple tweaks to the tracing code:

 - trace the request size for all requests
 - trace request sector and nr_sectors only for fs requests, enforced by
   helpers
 - drop SCSI CDB tracing - we have SCSI tracing for this and are going
   to me the CDB out of the generic struct request soon.

With this the tracing code stops to know about BLOCK_PC requests entirely,
it's just FS vs passthrough requests now, where the latter includes any
driver-private requests.
