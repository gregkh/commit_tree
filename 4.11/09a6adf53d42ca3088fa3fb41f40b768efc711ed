arm64: mm: unaligned access by user-land should be received as SIGBUS

After 52d7523 (arm64: mm: allow the kernel to handle alignment faults on
user accesses) commit user-land accesses that produce unaligned exceptions
like in case of aarch32 ldm/stm/ldrd/strd instructions operating on
unaligned memory received by user-land as SIGSEGV. It is wrong, it should
be reported as SIGBUS as it was before 52d7523 commit.

Changed do_bad_area function to take signal and code parameters out of esr
value using fault_info table, so in case of do_alignment_fault fault
user-land will receive SIGBUS. Wrapped access to fault_info table into
esr_to_fault_info function.
