udf: Make stat on symlink report symlink length as st_size

UDF encodes symlinks in a more complex fashion and thus i_size of a
symlink does not match the lenght of a string returned by readlink(2).
This confuses some applications (see bug 191241) and may be considered a
violation of POSIX. Fix the problem by reading the link into page cache
in response to stat(2) call and report the length of the decoded path.
