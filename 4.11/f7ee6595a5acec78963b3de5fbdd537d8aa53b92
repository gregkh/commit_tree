tools lib subcmd: Fix missing member name

This patch adds missing member names to struct initializations.

Although in C99 for struct S {int x, int y} two init codes struct S s =
{.x = (a), (b)} and struct S s = {.x = (a), .y = (b)} are the same, it
is better to explicitly write .y (.argh in this patch) for readability
and robustness against language/compiler evolutions.
