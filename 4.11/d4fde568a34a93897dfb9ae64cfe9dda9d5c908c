powerpc/64: Use optimized checksum routines on little-endian

Currently we have optimized hand-coded assembly checksum routines for
big-endian 64-bit systems, but for little-endian we use the generic C
routines. This modifies the optimized routines to work for
little-endian. With this, we no longer need to enable
CONFIG_GENERIC_CSUM. This also fixes a couple of comments in
checksum_64.S so they accurately reflect what the associated instruction
does.
