md/raid1/10: fix potential deadlock

Neil Brown pointed out a potential deadlock in raid 10 code with
bio_split/chain. The raid1 code could have the same issue, but recent
barrier rework makes it less likely to happen. The deadlock happens in
below sequence:

1. generic_make_request(bio), this will set current->bio_list
2. raid10_make_request will split bio to bio1 and bio2
3. __make_request(bio1), wait_barrer, add underlayer disk bio to
current->bio_list
4. __make_request(bio2), wait_barrer

If raise_barrier happens between 3 & 4, since wait_barrier runs at 3,
raise_barrier waits for IO completion from 3. And since raise_barrier
sets barrier, 4 waits for raise_barrier. But IO from 3 can't be
dispatched because raid10_make_request() doesn't finished yet.

The solution is to adjust the IO ordering. Quotes from Neil:
"
It is much safer to:

    if (need to split) {
        split = bio_split(bio, ...)
        bio_chain(...)
        make_request_fn(split);
        generic_make_request(bio);
   } else
        make_request_fn(mddev, bio);

This way we first process the initial section of the bio (in 'split')
which will queue some requests to the underlying devices.  These
requests will be queued in generic_make_request.
Then we queue the remainder of the bio, which will be added to the end
of the generic_make_request queue.
Then we return.
generic_make_request() will pop the lower-level device requests off the
queue and handle them first.  Then it will process the remainder
of the original bio once the first section has been fully processed.
"

Note, this only happens in read path. In write path, the bio is flushed to
underlaying disks either by blk flush (from schedule) or offladed to raid1/10d.
It's queued in current->bio_list.
