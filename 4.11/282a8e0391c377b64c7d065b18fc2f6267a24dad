dax: add tracepoint infrastructure, PMD tracing

Tracepoints are the standard way to capture debugging and tracing
information in many parts of the kernel, including the XFS and ext4
filesystems.  Create a tracepoint header for FS DAX and add the first DAX
tracepoints to the PMD fault handler.  This allows the tracing for DAX to
be done in the same way as the filesystem tracing so that developers can
look at them together and get a coherent idea of what the system is doing.

I added both an entry and exit tracepoint because future patches will add
tracepoints to child functions of dax_iomap_pmd_fault() like
dax_pmd_load_hole() and dax_pmd_insert_mapping().  We want those messages
to be wrapped by the parent function tracepoints so the code flow is more
easily understood.  Having entry and exit tracepoints for faults also
allows us to easily see what filesystems functions were called during the
fault.  These filesystem functions get executed via iomap_begin() and
iomap_end() calls, for example, and will have their own tracepoints.

For PMD faults we primarily want to understand the type of mapping, the
fault flags, the faulting address and whether it fell back to 4k faults.
If it fell back to 4k faults the tracepoints should let us understand why.

I named the new tracepoint header file "fs_dax.h" to allow for device DAX
to have its own separate tracing header in the same directory at some
point.

Here is an example output for these events from a successful PMD fault:
