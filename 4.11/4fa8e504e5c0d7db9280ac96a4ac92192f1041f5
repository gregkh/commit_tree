CIFS: Fix build failure with smb2

I saw the following build error during a randconfig build:

fs/cifs/smb2ops.c: In function 'smb2_new_lease_key':
fs/cifs/smb2ops.c:1104:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'generate_random_uuid' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

Explicit include the right header to fix this issue.
