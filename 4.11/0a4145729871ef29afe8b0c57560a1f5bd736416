target: fail ALUA transitions for pscsi

We do not setup the LU group for pscsi devices, so if you write
a state to alua_access_state that will cause a transition you will
get a NULL pointer dereference.

This patch will fail attempts to try and transition the path
for backend devices that set the TRANSPORT_FLAG_PASSTHROUGH_ALUA
flag.
