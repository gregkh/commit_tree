userfaultfd: shmem: __do_fault requires VM_FAULT_NOPAGE

__do_fault assumes vmf->page has been initialized and is valid if
VM_FAULT_NOPAGE is not returned by vma->vm_ops->fault(vma, vmf).

handle_userfault() in turn should return VM_FAULT_NOPAGE if it doesn't
return VM_FAULT_SIGBUS or VM_FAULT_RETRY (the other two possibilities).

This VM_FAULT_NOPAGE case is only invoked when signal are pending and it
didn't matter for anonymous memory before.  It only started to matter
since shmem was introduced.  hugetlbfs also takes a different path and
doesn't exercise __do_fault.
