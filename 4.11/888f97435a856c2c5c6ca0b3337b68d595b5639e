power: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Drop platform_data dependency

When the axp288_faul_gauge driver was originally merged, it was
merged with a dependency on some other driver providing platform
data for it.

However the battery-data-framework which should provide that data
never got merged, resulting in x86 tablets / laptops with an axp288
having no working battery monitor, as before this commit the driver
would simply return -ENODEV if there is no platform data.

This commit removes the dependency on the platform_data instead
checking that the firmware has initialized the fuel-gauge and
reading the info back from the pmic.

What is missing from the read-back info is the table to map raw adc
values to temperature, so this commit drops the temperature and
temperature limits properties. The min voltage, charge design and
model name info is also missing. Note that none of these are really
important for userspace to have.

All other functionality is preserved and actually made available
by this commit.
