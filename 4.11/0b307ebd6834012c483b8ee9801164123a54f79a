netvsc: remove no longer needed receive staging buffers

The ring buffer mapping now handles the wraparound case
inside get_next_pkt_raw. Therefore it is not necessary to have an
additional special receive staging buffer.

See commit 1562edaed8c164ca5199 ("Drivers: hv: ring_buffer: count on
wrap around mappings")
