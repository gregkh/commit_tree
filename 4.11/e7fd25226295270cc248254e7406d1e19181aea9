remoteproc: qcom: q6v5: Decouple driver from MDT loader

Rather than duplicating half of the MDT loader in the validation step
move the entire MDT parser into the q6v5 driver. This allows us to make
the shared MDT-loader call the SCM PAS operations directly which
simplifies the client code and allows for better reuse of the code.
