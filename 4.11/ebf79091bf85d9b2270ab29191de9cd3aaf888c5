ASoC: Intel: select DW_DMAC_CORE since it's mandatory

Select DW_DMAC_CORE like the rest of glue drivers do, e.g.
drivers/dma/dw/Kconfig.

While here group selectors under SND_SOC_INTEL_HASWELL and
SND_SOC_INTEL_BAYTRAIL.

Make platforms, which are using a common SST firmware driver, to be
dependent on DMADEVICES.
