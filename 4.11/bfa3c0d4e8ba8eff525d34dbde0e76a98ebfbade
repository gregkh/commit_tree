ARM: tegra: nyan-big: Include compatible revisions for proper detection

Depthcharge (the payload used with cros devices) will attempt to detect
boards using their revision. This includes all the known revisions for
the nyan-big board so that the dtb can be selected preferably.

Defining compatibly revisions allows depthcharge to select the kernel
via the revision it detects instead of using the default kernel. This
allows having a FIT image with multiple kernels for multiple devices.
