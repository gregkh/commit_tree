average: change to declare precision, not factor

Declaring the factor is counter-intuitive, and people are prone
to using small(-ish) values even when that makes no sense.

Change the DECLARE_EWMA() macro to take the fractional precision,
in bits, rather than a factor, and update all users.

While at it, add some more documentation.
