dmaengine: stm32-dma: Fix residue computation issue in cyclic mode

This patch resolves the residue computation issue detected in cyclic mode.
Now, in cyclic mode, we increment next_sg variable as soon as a period is
transferred instead of after pushing a new sg request.
Then, we take into account that after transferring a complete buffer,
the next_sg variable is equal to 0.
