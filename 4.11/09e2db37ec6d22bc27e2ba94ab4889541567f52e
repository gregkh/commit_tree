rcu: Add comment headers to expedited-grace-period counter functions

These functions (rcu_exp_gp_seq_start(), rcu_exp_gp_seq_end(),
rcu_exp_gp_seq_snap(), and rcu_exp_gp_seq_done() seemed too obvious
to comment when written, but not so much when being documented.
This commit therefore adds header comments to each of them.
