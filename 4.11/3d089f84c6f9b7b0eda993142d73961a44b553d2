KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't store values derivable from HPT order

Currently the kvm_hpt_info structure stores the hashed page table's order,
and also the number of HPTEs it contains and a mask for its size.  The
last two can be easily derived from the order, so remove them and just
calculate them as necessary with a couple of helper inlines.
