Revert "tty: serial: pl011: add ttyAMA for matching pl011 console"

The original patch makes the condition always true, so it is wrong.

It masks (but not fixes) the bug described in the commit message
but introduces a regression (no console is selected by SPCR)
in regular (no 'console=ttyAMA') case.

s/||/&&/ would not fix the problem as the root cause was identified
incorrectly.

This reverts commit aea9a80ba98a0c9b4de88850260e9fbdcc98360b.
