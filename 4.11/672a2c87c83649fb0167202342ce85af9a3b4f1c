axonram: Fix gendisk handling

It is invalid to call del_gendisk() when disk->queue is NULL. Fix error
handling in axon_ram_probe() to avoid doing that.

Also del_gendisk() does not drop a reference to gendisk allocated by
alloc_disk(). That has to be done by put_disk(). Add that call where
needed.
