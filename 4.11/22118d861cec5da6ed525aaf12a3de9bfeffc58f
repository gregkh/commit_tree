bnx2x: fix possible overrun of VFPF multicast addresses array

It is too late to check for the limit of the number of VF multicast
addresses after they have already been copied to the req->multicast[]
array, possibly overflowing it.

Do the check before copying.

Also fix the error path to not skip unlocking vf2pf_mutex.
