cpufreq: intel_pstate: Lower frequency than expected under no_turbo

When turbo is not disabled by BIOS, but user disabled from intel P-State
sysfs and changes max/min using cpufreq sysfs, the resultant frequency
is lower than what user requested.

The reason for this, when the perf limits are calculated in set_policy()
callback, they are with reference to max cpu frequency (turbo frequency
), but when enforced in the intel_pstate_get_min_max() they are with
reference to max available performance as documented in the intel_pstate
documentation (in this case max non turbo P-State).

This needs similar change as done in intel_cpufreq_verify_policy() for
passive mode. Set policy->cpuinfo.max_freq based on the turbo status.
