kprobes/x86: Fix kernel panic when certain exception-handling addresses are probed

Fix to the exception table entry check by using probed address
instead of the address of copied instruction.

This bug may cause unexpected kernel panic if user probe an address
where an exception can happen which should be fixup by __ex_table
(e.g. copy_from_user.)

Unless user puts a kprobe on such address, this doesn't
cause any problem.

This bug has been introduced years ago, by commit:

  464846888d9a ("x86/kprobes: Fix a bug which can modify kernel code permanently").
