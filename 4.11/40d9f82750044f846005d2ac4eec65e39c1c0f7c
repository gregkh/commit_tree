timekeeping: Remove unused timekeeping_{get,set}_tai_offset()

The last caller to timekeeping_set_tai_offset() was in commit
0b5154fb9040 (timekeeping: Simplify tai updating from
do_adjtimex, 2013-03-22) and the last caller to
timekeeping_get_tai_offset() was in commit 76f4108892d9 (hrtimer:
Cleanup hrtimer accessors to the timekepeing state, 2014-07-16).
Remove these unused functions now that we handle TAI offsets
differently.
