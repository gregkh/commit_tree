KVM: MIPS/T&E: Expose read-only CP0_IntCtl register

Expose the CP0_IntCtl register through the KVM register access API,
which is a required register since MIPS32r2. It is currently read-only
since the VS field isn't implemented due to lack of Config3.VInt or
Config3.VEIC.

It is implemented in trap_emul.c so that a VZ implementation can allow
writes.
