usb: chipidea: Remove locking in ci_udc_start()

We don't call hw_device_reset() with the ci->lock held, so it
doesn't seem like this lock here is protecting anything. Let's
just remove it. This allows us to call sleeping functions like
phy_init() from within the CI_HDRC_CONTROLLER_RESET_EVENT hook.
