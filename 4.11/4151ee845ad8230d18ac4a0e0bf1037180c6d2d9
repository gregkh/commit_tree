ALSA: x86: Remove _v[12] suffices

Although we dropped the most of the obsoleted *_v1 definitions and
codes, some codes still keep the _v1 or _v2 suffices.  Now they are
ripped off.

The only thing to be done carefully here is the definition of control
offsets.  The original code defines enum hdmi_ctrl_reg_offset_v1 and
a few new elements just for v2 on its top.  After this cleanup, we
remove the old AUD_HDMI_STATUS and AUD_HDMIW_INFOFR definitions and
replace with the v2 values.
