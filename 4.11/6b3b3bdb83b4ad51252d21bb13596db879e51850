scsi: lpfc: Add missing memory barrier

On loosely ordered memory systems (PPC for example), the WQE elements
were being updated in memory, but not necessarily flushed before the
separate doorbell was written to hw which would cause hw to dma the
WQE element. Thus, the hardware occasionally received partially
updated WQE data.

Add the memory barrier after updating the WQE memory.
