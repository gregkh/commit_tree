kvm: nVMX: Split VMCS checks from nested_vmx_run()

The checks performed on the contents of the vmcs12 are extracted from
nested_vmx_run so that they can be used to validate a vmcs12 that has
been restored from a checkpoint.

[Change prepare_vmcs02 and nested_vmx_load_cr3's last argument to u32,
 to match check_vmentry_postreqs.  Update comments for singlestep
 handling. - Paolo]
