netfilter: conntrack: no need to pass ctinfo to error handler

It is never accessed for reading and the only places that write to it
are the icmp(6) handlers, which also set skb->nfct (and skb->nfctinfo).

The conntrack core specifically checks for attached skb->nfct after
->error() invocation and returns early in this case.
