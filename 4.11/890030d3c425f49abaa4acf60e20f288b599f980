mac80211: don't handle filtered frames within a BA session

When running a BA session, the driver (or the hardware) already takes
care of retransmitting failed frames, since it has to keep the receiver
reorder window in sync.

Adding another layer of retransmit around that does not improve
anything. In fact, it can only lead to some strong reordering with huge
latency.
