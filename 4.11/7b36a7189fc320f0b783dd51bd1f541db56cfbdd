block: don't call ioc_exit_icq() with the queue lock held for blk-mq

For legacy scheduling, we always call ioc_exit_icq() with both the
ioc and queue lock held. This poses a problem for blk-mq with
scheduling, since the queue lock isn't what we use in the scheduler.
And since we don't need the queue lock held for ioc exit there,
don't grab it and leave any extra locking up to the blk-mq scheduler.
