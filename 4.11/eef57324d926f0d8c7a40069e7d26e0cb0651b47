drm/i915: setup bridge for HDMI LPE audio driver

Enable support for HDMI LPE audio mode on Baytrail and
Cherrytrail when HDaudio controller is not detected

Setup minimum required resources during i915_driver_load:
1. Create a platform device to share MMIO/IRQ resources
2. Make the platform device child of i915 device for runtime PM.
3. Create IRQ chip to forward HDMI LPE audio irqs.

HDMI LPE audio driver (a standalone sound driver) probes the
LPE audio device and creates a new sound card.
