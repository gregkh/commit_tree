crypto: chacha20 - convert generic and x86 versions to skcipher

This converts the ChaCha20 code from a blkcipher to a skcipher, which
is now the preferred way to implement symmetric block and stream ciphers.

This ports the generic and x86 versions at the same time because the
latter reuses routines of the former.

Note that the skcipher_walk() API guarantees that all presented blocks
except the final one are a multiple of the chunk size, so we can simplify
the encrypt() routine somewhat.
