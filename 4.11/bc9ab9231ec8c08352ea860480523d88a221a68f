net: ethernet: aquantia: set net_device mtu when mtu is changed

When the aquantia device mtu is changed the net_device structure is not
updated.  As a result the ip command does not properly reflect the mtu change.

Commit 5513e16421cb incorrectly assumed that __dev_set_mtu() was making the
assignment ndev->mtu = new_mtu;  This is not true in the case where the driver
has a ndo_change_mtu routine.

Fixes: 5513e16421cb ("net: ethernet: aquantia: Fixes for aq_ndev_change_mtu")
