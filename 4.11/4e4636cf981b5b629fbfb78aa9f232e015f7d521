objtool: Enclose contents of unreachable() macro in a block

Guenter Roeck reported a boot failure in mips64.  It was bisected to the
following commit:

  d1091c7fa3d5 ("objtool: Improve detection of BUG() and other dead ends")

The unreachable() macro was formerly only composed of a single
statement.  The above commit added a second statement, but neglected to
enclose the statements in a block.
