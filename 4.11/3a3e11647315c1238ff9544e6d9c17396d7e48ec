dt-bindings: power: supply: Add otg regulator binding

Add a binding for the regulator which controls the OTG chargepath switch.
The OTG switch gets its power from pm8941_5vs1, and that should be
expressed as a usb_otg_in-supply property in the DT node for the
charger driver.  The regulator name is "otg-vbus".
