fm10k: request reset when mbx->state changes

Multiple IES API resets can cause a race condition where the mailbox
interrupt request bits can be cleared before being handled. This can
leave certain mailbox messages from the PF to be untreated and the PF
will enter in some inactive state. If this situation occurs, the IES API
will initiate a mailbox version reset which, then, trigger a mailbox
state change. Once this mailbox transition occurs (from OPEN to CONNECT
state), a request for reset will be returned.

This ensures that PF will undergo a reset whenever IES API encounters an
unknown global mailbox interrupt event or whenever the IES API
terminates.
