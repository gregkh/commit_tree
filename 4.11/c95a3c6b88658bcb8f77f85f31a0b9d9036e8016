xprtrdma: Disable pad optimization by default

Commit d5440e27d3e5 ("xprtrdma: Enable pad optimization") made the
Linux client omit XDR round-up padding in normal Read and Write
chunks so that the client doesn't have to register and invalidate
3-byte memory regions that contain no real data.

Unfortunately, my cheery 2014 assessment that this optimization "is
supported now by both Linux and Solaris servers" was premature.
We've found bugs in Solaris in this area since commit d5440e27d3e5
("xprtrdma: Enable pad optimization") was merged (SYMLINK is the
main offender).

So for maximum interoperability, I'm disabling this optimization
again. If a CM private message is exchanged when connecting, the
client recognizes that the server is Linux, and enables the
optimization for that connection.

Until now the Solaris server bugs did not impact common operations,
and were thus largely benign. Soon, less capable devices on Linux
NFS/RDMA clients will make use of Read chunks more often, and these
Solaris bugs will prevent interoperation in more cases.
