mmc: sunxi: Mask DATA0 when updating the clock

The A64 MMC controllers need DATA0 to be masked while updating the clock,
otherwise any subsequent command will result in a timeout.

It's not really clear at this point what DATA0 is exactly, but this
behaviour is present in Allwinner's tree, and has been suggested by
Allwinner engineers as fixes for the timeout.
