Revert "usb: gadget: uvc: Add missing call for additional setup data"

This reverts commit 4fbac5206afd01b717d4bdc58793d471f3391b4b.

This commit breaks g_webcam when used with uvc-gadget [1].

The user space application (e.g. uvc-gadget) is responsible for
sending response to UVC class specific requests on control endpoint
in uvc_send_response() in uvc_v4l2.c.

The bad commit was causing a duplicate response to be sent with
incorrect response data thus causing UVC probe to fail at the host
and broken control transfer endpoint at the gadget.
