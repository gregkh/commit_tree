pwm: imx: Move PWMv2 wait for fifo slot code to a separate function

The code, which waits for fifo slot, has been extracted from
imx_pwm_config_v2 function and moved to new one - imx_pwm_wait_fifo_slot().

This change reduces the overall size of imx_pwm_config_v2() and prepares
it for atomic PWM operation.
