ASoC: Revert "Drop SND_DMAENGINE_PCM_FLAG_CUSTOM_CHANNEL_NAME flag"

This reverts commit c6644119a3f80ea644bde10009d5e1013b5aff29 and
restores the ability to specify DMA channel names per DAI dma_data.
Unfortunately the functionality removed in the patch being reverted
cannot be entirely replaced by specifying DMA channel names in struct
snd_dmaengine_pcm_config as that does not cover devices with more than
2 DMA channels.

Together with patch "ASoC: Revert "samsung: Remove unneeded
initialization of chan_name"" this fixes broken sound on the s3c24xx
SoC platforms.
