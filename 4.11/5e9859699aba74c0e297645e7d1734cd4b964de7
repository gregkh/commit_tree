KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Outline of KVM-HV HPT resizing implementation

This adds a not yet working outline of the HPT resizing PAPR
extension.  Specifically it adds the necessary ioctl() functions,
their basic steps, the work function which will handle preparation for
the resize, and synchronization between these, the guest page fault
path and guest HPT update path.

The actual guts of the implementation isn't here yet, so for now the
calls will always fail.
