dm round robin: revert "use percpu 'repeat_count' and 'current_path'"

The sloppy nature of lockless access to percpu pointers
(s->current_path) in rr_select_path(), from multiple threads, is
causing some paths to used more than others -- which results in less
IO performance being observed.

Revert these upstream commits to restore truly symmetric round-robin
IO submission in DM multipath:

b0b477c dm round robin: use percpu 'repeat_count' and 'current_path'
802934b dm round robin: do not use this_cpu_ptr() without having preemption disabled

There is no benefit to all this complexity if repeat_count = 1 (which is
the recommended default).
