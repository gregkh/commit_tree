i40e: Quick refactor to start moving data off stack and into Tx buffer info

This patch does some quick work to pull some of the data off of the stack
and hopefully start storing it in the Tx buffer info section of the Tx
ring.  Ideally we should be moving away from having to store much of
anything on the stack and can just maintain it all in the descriptor rings.
