crypto: Replaced gcc specific attributes with macros from compiler.h

Continuing from this commit: 52f5684c8e1e
("kernel: use macros from compiler.h instead of __attribute__((...))")

I submitted 4 total patches. They are part of task I've taken up to
increase compiler portability in the kernel. I've cleaned up the
subsystems under /kernel /mm /block and /security, this patch targets
/crypto.

There is <linux/compiler.h> which provides macros for various gcc specific
constructs. Eg: __weak for __attribute__((weak)). I've cleaned all
instances of gcc specific attributes with the right macros for the crypto
subsystem.

I had to make one additional change into compiler-gcc.h for the case when
one wants to use this: __attribute__((aligned) and not specify an alignment
factor. From the gcc docs, this will result in the largest alignment for
that data type on the target machine so I've named the macro
__aligned_largest. Please advise if another name is more appropriate.
