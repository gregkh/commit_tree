PM / Domains: Fix asynchronous execution of *noirq() callbacks

As the PM core may invoke the *noirq() callbacks asynchronously, the
current lock-less approach in genpd doesn't work. The consequence is that
we may find concurrent operations racing to power on/off the PM domain.

As of now, no immediate errors has been reported, but it's probably only a
matter time. Therefor let's fix the problem now before this becomes a real
issue, by deploying the locking scheme to the relevant functions.
