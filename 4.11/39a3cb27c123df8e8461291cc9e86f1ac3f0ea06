MIPS: elfcore: add correct copy_regs implementations

MIPS does not currently define ELF_CORE_COPY_REGS macros and as a result
the generic implementation is used. The generic version attempts to do
directly map (struct pt_regs) into (elf_gregset_t), which isn't correct
for MIPS platforms and also triggers a BUG() at runtime in
include/linux/elfcore.h:16 (BUG_ON(sizeof(*elfregs) != sizeof(*regs)))

[ralf@linux-mips.org: Add semicolons to the macro definitions as I do not
apply https://patchwork.linux-mips.org/patch/14588/ for now.]
