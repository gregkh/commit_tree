ipvlan: improvise dev_id generation logic in IPvlan

The patch 009146d117b ("ipvlan: assign unique dev-id for each slave
device.") used ida_simple_get() to generate dev_ids assigned to the
slave devices. However (Eric has pointed out that) there is a shortcoming
with that approach as it always uses the first available ID. This
becomes a problem when a slave gets deleted and a new slave gets added.
The ID gets reassigned causing the new slave to get the same link-local
address. This side-effect is undesirable.

This patch adds a per-port variable that keeps track of the IDs
assigned and used as the stat-base for the IDR api. This base will be
wrapped around when it reaches the MAX (0xFFFE) value possibly on a
busy system where slaves are added and deleted routinely.
