usb: host: xhci: rename completion codes to match spec

Cleanup only. This patch is a mechaninal rename to make sure our macros
for TRB completion codes match what the specification uses to refer to
such errors. The idea behind this is that it makes it far easier to grep
the specification and match it with implementation.
