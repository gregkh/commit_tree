ALSA: ctxfi: Fix the incorrect check of dma_set_mask() call

In the commit [15c75b09f8d1: ALSA: ctxfi: Fallback DMA mask to 32bit],
I forgot to put "!" at dam_set_mask() call check in cthw20k1.c (while
cthw20k2.c is OK).  This patch fixes that obvious bug.

(As a side note: although the original commit was completely wrong,
 it's still working for most of machines, as it sets to 32bit DMA mask
 in the end.  So the bug severity is low.)
