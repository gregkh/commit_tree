parisc: Clean up fixup routines for get_user()/put_user()

Al Viro noticed that userspace accesses via get_user()/put_user() can be
simplified a lot with regard to usage of the exception handling.

This patch implements a fixup routine for get_user() and put_user() in such
that the exception handler will automatically load -EFAULT into the register
%r8 (the error value) in case on a fault on userspace.  Additionally the fixup
routine will zero the target register on fault in case of a get_user() call.
The target register is extracted out of the faulting assembly instruction.

This patch brings a few benefits over the old implementation:
1. Exception handling gets much cleaner, easier and smaller in size.
2. Helper functions like fixup_get_user_skip_1 (all of fixup.S) can be dropped.
3. No need to hardcode %r9 as target register for get_user() any longer. This
   helps the compiler register allocator and thus creates less assembler
   statements.
4. No dependency on the exception_data contents any longer.
5. Nested faults will be handled cleanly.
