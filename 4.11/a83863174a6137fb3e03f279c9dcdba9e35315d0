sctp: prepare asoc stream for stream reconf

sctp stream reconf, described in RFC 6525, needs a structure to
save per stream information in assoc, like stream state.

In the future, sctp stream scheduler also needs it to save some
stream scheduler params and queues.

This patchset is to prepare the stream array in assoc for stream
reconf. It defines sctp_stream that includes stream arrays inside
to replace ssnmap.

Note that we use different structures for IN and OUT streams, as
the members in per OUT stream will get more and more different
from per IN stream.

v1->v2:
  - put these patches into a smaller group.
v2->v3:
  - define sctp_stream to contain stream arrays, and create stream.c
    to put stream-related functions.
  - merge 3 patches into 1, as new sctp_stream has the same name
    with before.
