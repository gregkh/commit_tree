IB/IPoIB: Add destination address when re-queue packet

When sending packet to destination that was not resolved yet
via path query, the driver keeps the skb and tries to re-send it
again when the path is resolved.

But when re-sending via dev_queue_xmit the kernel doesn't call
to dev_hard_header, so IPoIB needs to keep 20 bytes in the skb
and to put the destination address inside them.

In that way the dev_start_xmit will have the correct destination,
and the driver won't take the destination from the skb->data, while
nothing exists there, which causes to packet be be dropped.

The test flow is:
1. Run the SM on remote node,
2. Restart the driver.
4. Ping some destination,
3. Observe that first ICMP request will be dropped.
