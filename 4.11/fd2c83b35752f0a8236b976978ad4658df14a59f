net/packet: check length in getsockopt() called with PACKET_HDRLEN

In the case getsockopt() is called with PACKET_HDRLEN and optlen < 4
|val| remains uninitialized and the syscall may behave differently
depending on its value, and even copy garbage to userspace on certain
architectures. To fix this we now return -EINVAL if optlen is too small.

This bug has been detected with KMSAN.
