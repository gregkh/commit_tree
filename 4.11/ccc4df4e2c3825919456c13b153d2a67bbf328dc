Documentation: Correct duplicate section number in kvm/api.txt

Both KVM_CREATE_SPAPR_TCE_64 and KVM_REINJECT_CONTROL have section number
4.98 in Documentation/virtual/kvm/api.txt, presumably due to a naive merge.
This corrects the duplication.

[paulus@ozlabs.org - correct section numbers for following sections,
 KVM_PPC_CONFIGURE_V3_MMU and KVM_PPC_GET_RMMU_INFO, as well.]
