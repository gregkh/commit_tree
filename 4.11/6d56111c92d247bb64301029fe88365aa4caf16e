KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Fix GICC_PMR uaccess on GICv3 and clarify ABI

As an oversight, for GICv2, we accidentally export the GICC_PMR register
in the format of the GICH_VMCR.VMPriMask field in the lower 5 bits of a
word, meaning that userspace must always use the lower 5 bits to
communicate with the KVM device and must shift the value left by 3
places to obtain the actual priority mask level.

Since GICv3 supports the full 8 bits of priority masking in the ICH_VMCR,
we have to fix the value we export when emulating a GICv2 on top of a
hardware GICv3 and exporting the emulated GICv2 state to userspace.

Take the chance to clarify this aspect of the ABI.
