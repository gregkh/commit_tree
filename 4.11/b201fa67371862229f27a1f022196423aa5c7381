rcu: Remove short-term CPU kicking

Commit 4914950aaa12d ("rcu: Stop treating in-kernel CPU-bound workloads
as errors") added a (relatively) short-timeout call to resched_cpu().
This was inspired by as issue that was fixed by b7e7ade34e61 ("sched/core:
Fix remote wakeups").  But given that this issue was fixed, it is time
for the current commit to remove this call to resched_cpu().
