hwrng: amd - Revert managed API changes

After commit 31b2a73c9c5f ("hwrng: amd - Migrate to managed API"), the
amd-rng driver uses devres with pci_dev->dev to keep track of resources,
but does not actually register a PCI driver.  This results in the
following issues:

1. The message

WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 621 at drivers/base/dd.c:349 driver_probe_device+0x38c

is output when the i2c_amd756 driver loads and attempts to register a PCI
driver.  The PCI & device subsystems assume that no resources have been
registered for the device, and the WARN_ON() triggers since amd-rng has
already do so.

2.  The driver leaks memory because the driver does not attach to a
device.  The driver only uses the PCI device as a reference.   devm_*()
functions will release resources on driver detach, which the amd-rng
driver will never do.  As a result,

3.  The driver cannot be reloaded because there is always a use of the
ioport and region after the first load of the driver.
