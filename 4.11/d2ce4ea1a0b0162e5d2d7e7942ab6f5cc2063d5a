w1: don't leak refcount on slave attach failure in w1_attach_slave_device()

Near the beginning of w1_attach_slave_device() we increment a w1 master
reference count.
Later, when we are going to exit this function without actually attaching
a slave device (due to failure of __w1_attach_slave_device()) we need to
decrement this reference count back.
