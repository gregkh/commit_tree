i40e: fold the i40e_is_vsi_in_vlan check into i40e_put_mac_in_vlan

Fold the check for determining when to call i40e_put_mac_in_vlan directly
into the function so that we don't need to decide which function to use
ahead of time. This allows us to just call i40e_put_mac_in_vlan directly
without having to check ahead of time.
