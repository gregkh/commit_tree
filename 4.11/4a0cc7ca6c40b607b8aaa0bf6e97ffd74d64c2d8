btrfs: Make btrfs_ino take a struct btrfs_inode

Currently btrfs_ino takes a struct inode and this causes a lot of
internal btrfs functions which consume this ino to take a VFS inode,
rather than btrfs' own struct btrfs_inode. In order to fix this "leak"
of VFS structs into the internals of btrfs first it's necessary to
eliminate all uses of struct inode for the purpose of inode. This patch
does that by using BTRFS_I to convert an inode to btrfs_inode. With
this problem eliminated subsequent patches will start eliminating the
passing of struct inode altogether, eventually resulting in a lot cleaner
code.
