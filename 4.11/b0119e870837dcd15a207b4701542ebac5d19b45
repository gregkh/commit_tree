iommu: Introduce new 'struct iommu_device'

This struct represents one hardware iommu in the iommu core
code. For now it only has the iommu-ops associated with it,
but that will be extended soon.

The register/unregister interface is also added, as well as
making use of it in the Intel and AMD IOMMU drivers.
