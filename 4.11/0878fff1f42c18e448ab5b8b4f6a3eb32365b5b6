net: phy: Do not perform software reset for Generic PHY

The Generic PHY driver is a catch-all PHY driver and it should preserve
whatever prior initialization has been done by boot loader or firmware
agents. For specific PHY device configuration it is expected that a
specialized PHY driver would take over that role.

Resetting the generic PHY was a bad idea that has lead to several
complaints and downstream workarounds e.g: in OpenWrt/LEDE so restore
the behavior prior to 87aa9f9c61ad ("net: phy: consolidate PHY
reset in phy_init_hw()").
