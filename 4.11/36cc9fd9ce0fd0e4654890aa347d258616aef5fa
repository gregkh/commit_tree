soc: ti: wkup_m3_ipc: Drop wait from wkup_m3_rproc_boot_thread

The function wkup_m3_rproc_boot_thread waits for asynchronous
firmware loading to parse the resource table before calling
rproc_boot(). However, as the resource table parsing has been
moved to rproc_boot(), there's no need to wait for the
asynchronous firmware loading completion.  So, drop this.
