lightnvm: merge gennvm with core

For the first iteration of Open-Channel SSDs, it was anticipated that
there could be various media managers on top of an open-channel SSD,
such to allow vendors to plug in their own host-side FTLs, without the
media manager in between.

Now that an Open-Channel SSD is exposed as a traditional block device,
there is no longer a need for this. Therefore lets merge the gennvm code
with core and simplify the stack.
