i2c: brcmstb: Fix START and STOP conditions

The BSC data buffers to send and receive data are each of size 32 bytes
or 8 bytes 'xfersz' depending on SoC. The problem observed for all the
combined message transfer was if length of data transfer was a multiple
of 'xfersz' a repeated START was being transmitted by BSC driver. Fixed
this by appropriately setting START/STOP conditions for such transfers.
