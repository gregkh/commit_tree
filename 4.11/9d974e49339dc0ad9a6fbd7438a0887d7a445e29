[media] rc: ir-rc6-decoder: Add encode capability

Add the capability to encode RC-6 and RC-6A scancodes as raw events.

The Manchester modulation helper is used several times with various
timings so that RC-6 header preamble, the header, header trailing bit
and the data itself can be modulated correctly.
