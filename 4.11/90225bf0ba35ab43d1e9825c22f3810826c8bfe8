net: ethernet: ti: cpsw: add support for descs pool size configuration

The CPSW CPDMA can process buffer descriptors placed as in internal
CPPI RAM as in DDR. This patch adds support in CPSW and CPDMA for
descs_pool_size mudule parameter, which defines total number of CPDMA CPPI
descriptors to be used for both ingress/egress packets processing:
 - memory size, required for CPDMA descriptor pool, is calculated basing
on number of descriptors specified by user in descs_pool_size and
CPDMA descriptor size and allocated from coherent memory (CMA area);
 - CPDMA descriptor pool will be allocated in DDR if pool memory size >
internal CPPI RAM or use internal CPPI RAM otherwise;
 - if descs_pool_size not specified in DT - the default value 256 will
be used which will allow to place CPDMA descriptors pool into the
internal CPPI RAM (current default behaviour);
 - CPDMA will ignore descs_pool_size if descs_pool_size = 0 for
backward comaptiobility with davinci_emac.

descs_pool_size is boot time setting and can't be changed once
CPSW/CPDMA is initialized.
