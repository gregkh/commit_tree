drm/i915: advertise available metrics via sysfs

Each metric set is given a sysfs entry like:

/sys/class/drm/card0/metrics/<guid>/id

This allows userspace to enumerate the specific sets that are available
for the current system. The 'id' file contains an unsigned integer that
can be used to open the associated metric set via
DRM_IOCTL_I915_PERF_OPEN. The <guid> is a globally unique ID for a
specific OA unit register configuration that can be reliably used by
userspace as a key to lookup corresponding counter meta data and
normalization equations.

The guid registry is currently maintained as part of gputop along with
the XML metric set descriptions and code generation scripts, ref:
