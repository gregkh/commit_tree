net/mlx5: E-Switch, Don't allow changing inline mode when flows are configured

Changing the eswitch inline mode can potentially cause already configured
flows not to match the policy. E.g. set policy L4, add some L4 rules,
set policy to L2 --> bad! Hence we disallow it.

Keep track of how many offloaded rules are now set and refuse
inline mode changes if this isn't zero.
