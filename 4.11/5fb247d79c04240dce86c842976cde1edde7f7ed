KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Introduce VENG0 and VENG1 fields to vmcr struct

ICC_VMCR_EL2 supports virtual access to ICC_IGRPEN1_EL1.Enable
and ICC_IGRPEN0_EL1.Enable fields. Add grpen0 and grpen1 member
variables to struct vmcr to support read and write of these fields.

Also refactor vgic_set_vmcr and vgic_get_vmcr() code.
Drop ICH_VMCR_CTLR_SHIFT and ICH_VMCR_CTLR_MASK macros and instead
use ICH_VMCR_EOI* and ICH_VMCR_CBPR* macros.
