ACPICA: Hardware: Sort access bit width algorithm

ACPICA commit 365b321a31cb701957c055cae2d2161577147252

GAS can be in register or register region format, so we need to
improve our "register" format detection code in order not to
regress.

Such detection may be still experimental, and is generated according
to the current known facts.
