fpga zynq: Check the bitstream for validity

There is no sense in sending a bitstream we know will not work, and
with the variety of options for bitstream generation in Xilinx tools
it is not terribly clear what the correct input should be.

This is particularly important for Zynq since auto-correction was
removed from the driver and the Zynq hardware only accepts a bitstream
format that is different from what the Xilinx tools typically produce.

Worse, the hardware provides no indication why the bitstream fails,
it simply times out if the input is wrong.

The best option here is to have the kernel print a message informing
the user they are using a malformed bistream and programming failure
isn't for any of the myriad of other reasons.
