z3fold: fix header size related issues

Currently the whole kernel build will be stopped if the size of struct
z3fold_header is greater than the size of one chunk, which is 64 bytes
by default.  This patch instead defines the offset for z3fold objects as
the size of the z3fold header in chunks.

Fixed also are the calculation of num_free_chunks() and the address to
move the middle chunk to in case of in-page compaction in
z3fold_compact_page().
