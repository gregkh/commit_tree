tcp: fix various issues for sockets morphing to listen state

Dmitry Vyukov reported a divide by 0 triggered by syzkaller, exploiting
tcp_disconnect() path that was never really considered and/or used
before syzkaller ;)

I was not able to reproduce the bug, but it seems issues here are the
three possible actions that assumed they would never trigger on a
listener.

1) tcp_write_timer_handler
2) tcp_delack_timer_handler
3) MTU reduction

Only IPv6 MTU reduction was properly testing TCP_CLOSE and TCP_LISTEN
 states from tcp_v6_mtu_reduced()
