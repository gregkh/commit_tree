drm/rockchip: add extcon dependency for DP

The newly added DP driver links against the extcon core, which fails when
extcon is a module and this driver is not:

drivers/gpu/drm/rockchip/cdn-dp-core.o: In function `cdn_dp_get_port_lanes':
cdn-dp-core.c:(.text.cdn_dp_get_port_lanes+0x24): undefined reference to `extcon_get_state'
cdn-dp-core.c:(.text.cdn_dp_get_port_lanes+0x44): undefined reference to `extcon_get_property'

Let's make Kconfig enforce correct behavior with a dependency.
