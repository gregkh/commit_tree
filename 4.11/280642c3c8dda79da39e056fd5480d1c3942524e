platform/x86: acer-wmi: Inform firmware that RF Button Driver is active

The same method to activate LM(Launch Manager) can also be used to
activate the RF Button driver with different bit toggled in the same
lm_status. To express that many functions this byte field can achieve,
rename the lm_status to app_status. And also the app_mask is the bit
mask which specifically indicate which bits are going to be changed.

This solves a problem where the AR9565 wifi included in the
Acer Aspire ES1-421 is permanently hard blocked according to the rfkill
GPIO read by ath9k.
