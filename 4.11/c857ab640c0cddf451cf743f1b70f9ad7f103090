fs,eventpoll: don't test for bitfield with stack value

In case if epoll_ctl is called with operation EPOLL_CTL_DEL then
@epds.events variable allocated on stack may contain random bits which
we test then for EPOLLEXCLUSIVE.  Since currently the test look like

	if (epds.events & EPOLLEXCLUSIVE) {
		if (op == EPOLL_CTL_MOD)
			goto error_tgt_fput;
		if (op == EPOLL_CTL_ADD && (is_file_epoll(tf.file) ||
				(epds.events & ~EPOLLEXCLUSIVE_OK_BITS)))
			goto error_tgt_fput;
	}

Nothing serious will happen even if epds.events has this bit set, still
better to be on safe side and make sure that we're to test this bit at
all.
