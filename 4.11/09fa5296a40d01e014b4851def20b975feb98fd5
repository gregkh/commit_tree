userfaultfd: non-cooperative: wake userfaults after UFFDIO_UNREGISTER

Userfaults may still happen after the userfaultfd monitor thread
received a UFFD_EVENT_MADVDONTNEED until UFFDIO_UNREGISTER is run.

Wake any pending userfault within UFFDIO_UNREGISTER protected by the
mmap_sem for writing, so they will not be reported to userland leading
to UFFDIO_COPY returning -EINVAL (as the range was already unregistered)
and they will not hang permanently either.
