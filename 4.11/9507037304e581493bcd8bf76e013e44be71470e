scsi: ncr5380: Clean up dead code and redundant macro usage

Remove dead code inside #if 0 conditionals.

Remove the #ifdef __KERNEL__ test, since NCR5380.h has no definitions
that relate to userspace code.

Remove two redundant macro definitions which were overlooked in
commit e9db3198e08b ("sun3_scsi: Adopt NCR5380.c core driver").
