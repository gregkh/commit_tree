arm64: mm: enable CONFIG_HOLES_IN_ZONE for NUMA

The NUMA code may get confused by the presence of NOMAP regions within
zones, resulting in spurious BUG() checks where the node id deviates
from the containing zone's node id.

Since the kernel has no business reasoning about node ids of pages it
does not own in the first place, enable CONFIG_HOLES_IN_ZONE to ensure
that such pages are disregarded.
