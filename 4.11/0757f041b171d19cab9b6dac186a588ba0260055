scsi: hisi_sas: fix probe ordering problem

There is a potential probe issue in how we trigger the hw initialisation.
Although we use 1s timer to delay hw initialisation, there is still a
potential that sas_register_ha() is not be finished before we start
the PHY init from hw->hw_init().
To avoid this issue, initialise the hw after sas_register_ha() in the
same probe context.
Note: it is not necessary to use 1s timer now (modified v2 hw only).
