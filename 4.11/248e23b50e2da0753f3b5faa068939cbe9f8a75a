batman-adv: Fix double free during fragment merge error

The function batadv_frag_skb_buffer was supposed not to consume the skbuff
on errors. This was followed in the helper function
batadv_frag_insert_packet when the skb would potentially be inserted in the
fragment queue. But it could happen that the next helper function
batadv_frag_merge_packets would try to merge the fragments and fail. This
results in a kfree_skb of all the enqueued fragments (including the just
inserted one). batadv_recv_frag_packet would detect the error in
batadv_frag_skb_buffer and try to free the skb again.

The behavior of batadv_frag_skb_buffer (and its helper
batadv_frag_insert_packet) must therefore be changed to always consume the
skbuff to have a common behavior and avoid the double kfree_skb.
