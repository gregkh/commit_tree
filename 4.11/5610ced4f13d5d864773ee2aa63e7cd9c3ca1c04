[media] drivers: media: i2c: ml86v7667: constify v4l2_subdev_* structures

v4l2_subdev_{core/video}_ops structures are stored in the
fields of the v4l2_subdev_ops structure which are of type const.
Also, v4l2_subdev_ops structure is passed to a function
having its argument of type const. As these structures are never
modified, so declare them as const.
Done using Coccinelle: (One of the scripts used)
