sched/core: Convert ___assert_task_state() link time assert to BUILD_BUG_ON()

The length of TASK_STATE_TO_CHAR_STR was still checked using the old
link-time manual error method - convert it to BUILD_BUG_ON(). This
has a couple of advantages:

 - it's more obvious what's going on

 - it reduces the size and complexity of <linux/sched.h>

 - BUILD_BUG_ON() will fail during compilation, with a clearer
   error message than the link time assert.
