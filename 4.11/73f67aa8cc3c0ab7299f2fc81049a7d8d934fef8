drm/i915: distinguish G33 and Pineview from each other

Pineview deserves to use its own platform enum (which was already added,
unused, previously). IS_G33() no longer matches Pineview, and gets
replaced by IS_G33() || IS_PINEVIEW() or equivalent. Pineview is no
longer an outlier among platform definitions.
