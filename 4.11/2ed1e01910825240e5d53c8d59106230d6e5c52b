iwlwifi: mvm: accept arbitrary memory dump TLVs

There's no reason to be validating the memory dump types, or
checking them for duplication, or anything, since we really
just pass them through from the TLV to the dump.

Thus, change the way we handle memory dump TLVs to let the
driver just blindly use anything specified there, dumping it
into the memory dump output file.

This makes the system extensible without driver changes.
