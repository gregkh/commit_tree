mfd: max77686: Use the struct i2c_driver .probe_new instead of .probe

If a driver is only used in DT platforms, there's no need to get the
i2c_device_id as an argument of the probe function. Since this data
can be get from the matching of_device_id.

There's a temporary .probe_new field in struct i2c_driver that can be
used as probe callback for the case when i2c_device_id won't be used.
