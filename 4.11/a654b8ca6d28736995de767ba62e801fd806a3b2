ACPICA: Disassembler: Add Switch/Case disassembly support

ACPICA commit 0f6cc80e8af519a3c31184367b0a9be7a399cf53

iasl compiles Switch/Case statements into a single iteration While
loop with If/Else statements. This patch adds support to recognize
this generated compiler output and disassemble it back to the
original Switch statement.

Linux kernel is not affected by this patch.
