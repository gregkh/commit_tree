console: Add persistent scrollback buffers for all VGA consoles

Add a scrollback buffers for each VGA console. The benefit is that
the scrollback history is not flushed when switching between consoles
but is persistent.
The buffers are allocated on demand when a new console is opened.

This breaks tools like clear_console that rely on flushing the
scrollback history by switching back and forth between consoles
which is why this feature is disabled by default.
Use the escape sequence \e[3J instead for flushing the buffer.
