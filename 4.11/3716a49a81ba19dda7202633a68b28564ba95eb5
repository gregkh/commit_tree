hv_utils: implement Hyper-V PTP source

With TimeSync version 4 protocol support we started updating system time
continuously through the whole lifetime of Hyper-V guests. Every 5 seconds
there is a time sample from the host which triggers do_settimeofday[64]().
While the time from the host is very accurate such adjustments may cause
issues:
- Time is jumping forward and backward, some applications may misbehave.
- In case an NTP server runs in parallel and uses something else for time
  sync (network, PTP,...) system time will never converge.
- Systemd starts annoying you by printing "Time has been changed" every 5
  seconds to the system log.

Instead of doing in-kernel time adjustments offload the work to an
NTP client by exposing TimeSync messages as a PTP device. Users may now
decide what they want to use as a source.

I tested the solution with chrony, the config was:

 refclock PHC /dev/ptp0 poll 3 dpoll -2 offset 0

The result I'm seeing is accurate enough, the time delta between the guest
and the host is almost always within [-10us, +10us], the in-kernel solution
was giving us comparable results.

I also tried implementing PPS device instead of PTP by using not currently
used Hyper-V synthetic timers (we use only one of four for clockevent) but
with PPS source only chrony wasn't able to give me the required accuracy,
the delta often more that 100us.
