net/act_pedit: Introduce 'add' operation

This command could be useful to inc/dec fields.

For example, to forward any TCP packet and decrease its TTL:
$ tc filter add dev enp0s9 protocol ip parent ffff: \
    flower ip_proto tcp \
    action pedit munge ip ttl add 0xff pipe \
    action mirred egress redirect dev veth0

In the example above, adding 0xff to this u8 field is actually
decreasing it by one, since the operation is masked.
