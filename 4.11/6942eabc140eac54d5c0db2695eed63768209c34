platform/x86: fujitsu-laptop: replace "hotkey" with "laptop" in symbol names

Functions, structures, variables and constants whose names currently
contain the "hotkey" keyword are not only responsible for handling
hotkeys, but also other laptop-related features (rfkill, lid, dock,
LEDs).  Fix their naming by using a consistent "_laptop"/"_LAPTOP"
suffix/infix.  Update comments so that they reflect this change.
