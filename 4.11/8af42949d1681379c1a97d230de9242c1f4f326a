openrisc: xchg: fix `computed is not used` warning

When building allmodconfig this warning shows.

  fs/ocfs2/file.c: In function 'ocfs2_file_write_iter':
  ./arch/openrisc/include/asm/cmpxchg.h:81:3: warning: value computed is
  not used [-Wunused-value]
    ((typeof(*(ptr)))__xchg((unsigned long)(with), (ptr), sizeof(*(ptr))))
     ^

Applying the same patch logic that was done to the cmpxchg macro.
