powerpc/pseries: Implement indexed-count hotplug memory add

Indexed-count add for memory hotplug guarantees that a contiguous block
of <count> lmbs beginning at a specified <drc index> will be assigned,
any LMBs in this range that are not already assigned will be DLPAR added.
Because of Qemu's per-DIMM memory management, the addition of a contiguous
block of memory currently requires a series of individual calls to add
each LMB in the block. Indexed-count add reduces this series of calls to
a single call for the entire block.
