net/ena: fix RSS default hash configuration

ENA default hash configures IPv4_frag hash twice instead of
configure non-IP packets.

The bug caused IPv4 fragmented packets to be calculated based on
L2 source and destination address instead of L3 source and destination.
IPv4 packets can reach to the wrong Rx queue.
