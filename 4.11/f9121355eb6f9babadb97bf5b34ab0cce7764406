netfilter: nft_set_rbtree: incorrect assumption on lower interval lookups

In case of adjacent ranges, we may indeed see either the high part of
the range in first place or the low part of it. Remove this incorrect
assumption, let's make sure we annotate the low part of the interval in
case of we have adjacent interva intervals so we hit a matching in
lookups.
