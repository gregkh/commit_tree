pinctrl: aspeed-g4: Add mux configuration for all pins

The patch introducing the g4 pinctrl driver implemented a smattering of
pins to flesh out the implementation of the core and provide bare-bones
support for some OpenPOWER platforms. Now, update the bindings document
to reflect the complete functionality and implement the necessary pin
configuration tables in the driver.
