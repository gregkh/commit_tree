drm/i915: Fix oopses in the overlay code due to i915_gem_active stuff

The i915_gem_active stuff doesn't like a NULL ->retire hook, but
the overlay code can set it to NULL. That obviously ends up oopsing.
Fix it by introducing a new helper to assign the retirement callback
that will switch out the NULL function pointer with
i915_gem_retire_noop.
