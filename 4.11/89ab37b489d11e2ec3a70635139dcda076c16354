Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Add support for BCM2E95 and BCM2E96

The BCM2E96 ID is used by the ECS EF20 laptop, and BCM2E95 is present
in the Weibu F3C. Both are now logged as:

     hci0: BCM: chip id 82
     hci0: BCM43341B0 (002.001.014) build 0000
     hci0: BCM (002.001.014) build 0158

The ECS vendor kernel predates the host-wakeup support in hci_bcm but
it explicitly has a comment saying that the GPIO assignment needs to be
reordered for BCM2E96:
 1. (not used in vendor driver)
 2. Device wakeup
 3. Shutdown

For both devices in question, the DSDT has these GPIOs listed in order
of GpioInt, GpioIo, GpioIo. And if we use the first one listed (GpioInt)
as the host wakeup, that interrupt handler fires while doing bluetooth
I/O.

I am assuming the convention of GPIO ordering has been changed for these
new device IDs, so lets use the new ordering on such devices.
