coresight: STM: Balance enable/disable

The stm is automatically enabled when an application sets the policy
via ->link() call back by using coresight_enable(), which keeps the
refcount of the current users of the STM. However, the unlink() callback
issues stm_disable() directly, which leaves the STM turned off, without
the coresight layer knowing about it. This prevents any further uses
of the STM hardware as the coresight layer still thinks the STM is
turned on and doesn't enable the hardware when required. Even manually
enabling the STM via sysfs can't really enable the hw.

e.g,

 $ echo 1 > $CS_DEVS/$ETR/enable_sink
 $ mkdir -p $CONFIG_FS/stp-policy/$source.0/stm_test/
 $ echo 32768 65535 > $CONFIG_FS/stp-policy/$source.0/stm_test/channels
 $ echo 64 > $CS_DEVS/$source/traceid
 $ ./stm_app

 Note that we don't get any data from the ETR for the second session.

 Also dmesg shows :

This patch fixes the problem by balancing the unlink operation by using
the coresight_disable(), keeping the coresight layer in sync with the
hardware state and thus allowing normal usage of the STM component.
