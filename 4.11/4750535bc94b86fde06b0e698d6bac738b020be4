clocksource/drivers/gemini: Add driver for the Cortina Gemini

This is a rewrite of the Gemini timer
driver in arch/arm/mach-gemini/timer.c trying to do everything
the device tree way:

- Make every IO-access relative to a base address and dynamic
  so we can do a dynamic ioremap and get going.
- Do not poke around directly in the global syscon registers,
  access them using the syscon regmap style design pattern for
  the one register we need to check.
- Find register range and interrupt from the device tree.
