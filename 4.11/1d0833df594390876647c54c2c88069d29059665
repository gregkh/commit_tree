tcp: use sequence to break TS ties for RACK loss detection

The packets inside a jumbo skb (e.g., TSO) share the same skb
timestamp, even though they are sent sequentially on the wire. Since
RACK is based on time, it can not detect some packets inside the
same skb are lost.  However, we can leverage the packet sequence
numbers as extended timestamps to detect losses. Therefore, when
RACK timestamp is identical to skb's timestamp (i.e., one of the
packets of the skb is acked or sacked), we use the sequence numbers
of the acked and unacked packets to break ties.

We can use the same sequence logic to advance RACK xmit time as
well to detect more losses and avoid timeout.
