drm/i915: Avoid MST pipe handling for LPE audio

The pipe gets cleared to -1 for non-MST before the ELD audio
notification due to the MST audio support.  This makes sense for
HD-audio that received the MST handling, but it's useless for LPE
audio.  Handle the MST pipe hack conditionally only for HD-audio.
