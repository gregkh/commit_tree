KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Create kvmppc_unmap_hpte_helper()

The kvm_unmap_rmapp() function, called from certain MMU notifiers, is used
to force all guest mappings of a particular host page to be set ABSENT, and
removed from the reverse mappings.

For HPT resizing, we will have some cases where we want to set just a
single guest HPTE ABSENT and remove its reverse mappings.  To prepare with
this, we split out the logic from kvm_unmap_rmapp() to evict a single HPTE,
moving it to a new helper function.
