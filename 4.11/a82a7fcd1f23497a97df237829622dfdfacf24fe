IB/hfi1: Process qp wait list in IRQ thread periodically

In the event that the IRQ thread is extremely busy, the
processing of an rcd wait list can be delayed by quite
a bit until the IRQ thread completes its work.

The QP reset reference count wait can then appear to be stuck, thus
causing up a QP destroy to emit the hung task diagnostic.

Fix by processing the qp wait list periodically from the thread.  The
interval is a multiple (currently 4) of the MAX_PKT_RECV.

Also, reduce some of the excessive inlining.   The guidelines
are per packet is ok inline, otherwise the choice is based on
likelyhood of execution.
