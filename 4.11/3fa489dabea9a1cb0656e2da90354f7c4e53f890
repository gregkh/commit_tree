drm: Apply tight eviction scanning to color_adjust

Using mm->color_adjust makes the eviction scanner much tricker since we
don't know the actual neighbours of the target hole until after it is
created (after scanning is complete). To work out whether we need to
evict the neighbours because they impact upon the hole, we have to then
check the hole afterwards - requiring an extra step in the user of the
eviction scanner when they apply color_adjust.
