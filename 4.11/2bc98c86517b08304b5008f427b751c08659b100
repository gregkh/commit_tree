drm: Use drm_mm_nodes() as shorthand for the list of nodes under struct drm_mm

Fairly commonly we want to inspect the node list on the struct drm_mm,
which is buried within an embedded node. Bring it to the surface with a
bit of syntatic sugar.

Note this was intended to be split from commit ad579002c8ec ("drm: Add
drm_mm_for_each_node_safe()") before being applied, but my timing sucks.
