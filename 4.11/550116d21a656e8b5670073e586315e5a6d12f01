scripts/spelling.txt: add "aligment" pattern and fix typo instances

Fix typos and add the following to the scripts/spelling.txt:

  aligment||alignment

I did not touch the "N_BYTE_ALIGMENT" macro in
drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi/wifi.h to avoid unpredictable
impact.

I fixed "_aligment_handler" in arch/openrisc/kernel/entry.S because
it is surrounded by #if 0 ... #endif.  It is surely safe and I
confirmed "_alignment_handler" is correct.

I also fixed the "controler" I found in the same hunk in
arch/openrisc/kernel/head.S.
