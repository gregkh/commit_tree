serial: sh-sci: Fix register offsets for the IRDA serial port

Even though most of its registers are 8-bit wide, the IRDA has two
16-bit registers that make it a 16-bit peripheral and not a 8-bit
peripheral with addresses shifted by one. Fix the registers offset in
the driver and the platform data regshift value.
