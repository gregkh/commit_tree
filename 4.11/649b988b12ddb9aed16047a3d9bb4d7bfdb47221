ftrace: Do not hold references of ftrace_graph_{notrace_}hash out of graph_lock

The hashs ftrace_graph_hash and ftrace_graph_notrace_hash are modified
within the graph_lock being held. Holding a pointer to them and passing them
along can lead to a use of a stale pointer (fgd->hash). Move assigning the
pointer and its use to within the holding of the lock. Note, it's an
rcu_sched protected data, and other instances of referencing them are done
with preemption disabled. But the file manipuation code must be protected by
the lock.

The fgd->hash pointer is set to NULL when the lock is being released.
