mm: prevent NR_ISOLATE_* stats from going negative

Commit 6afcf8ef0ca0 ("mm, compaction: fix NR_ISOLATED_* stats for pfn
based migration") moved the dec_node_page_state() call (along with the
page_is_file_cache() call) to after putback_lru_page().

But page_is_file_cache() can change after putback_lru_page() is called,
so it should be called before putback_lru_page(), as it was before that
patch, to prevent NR_ISOLATE_* stats from going negative.

Without this fix, non-CONFIG_SMP kernels end up hanging in the
while(too_many_isolated()) { congestion_wait() } loop in
shrink_active_list() due to the negative stats.
