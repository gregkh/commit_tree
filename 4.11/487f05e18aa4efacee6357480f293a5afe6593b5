perf/core: Optimize event rescheduling on active contexts

When new events are added to an active context, we go and reschedule
all cpu groups and all task groups in order to preserve the priority
(cpu pinned, task pinned, cpu flexible, task flexible), but in
reality we only need to reschedule groups of the same priority as
that of the events being added, and below.

This patch changes the behavior so that only groups that need to be
rescheduled are rescheduled.
