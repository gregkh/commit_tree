[media] am437x-vpfe: always assign bpp variable

In vpfe_s_fmt(), when the sensor format and the requested format were
the same, bpp was assigned to vpfe->bpp without being initialized first.

Grab the bpp value that is currently used by using __vpfe_get_format()
instead of its wrapper, vpfe_try_fmt().

This use of uninitialized variable has been found by compiling the
kernel with clang.

support for AM437X")
