cpufreq: Remove policy create/remove notifiers

Those were added by:

commit fcd7af917abb ("cpufreq: stats: handle cpufreq_unregister_driver()
and suspend/resume properly")

but aren't used anymore since:

commit 1aefc75b2449 ("cpufreq: stats: Make the stats code non-modular").

Remove them. Also remove the redundant parameter to the respective
routines.
