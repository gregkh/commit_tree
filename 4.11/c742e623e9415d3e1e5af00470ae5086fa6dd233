mwifiex: sdio card reset enhancement

Commit b4336a282db8 ("mwifiex: sdio: reset adapter using mmc_hw_reset")
introduces a simple sdio card reset solution based on card remove and
re-probe. This solution has proved to be vulnerable, as card and
adapter structures are not protected, concurrent access will result in
kernel panic issues.

Let's reuse PCIe FLR's functions for SDIO reset to avoid freeing and
reallocating adapter and card structures.
