nfsd: stricter decoding of write-like NFSv2/v3 ops

The NFSv2/v3 code does not systematically check whether we decode past
the end of the buffer.  This generally appears to be harmless, but there
are a few places where we do arithmetic on the pointers involved and
don't account for the possibility that a length could be negative.  Add
checks to catch these.
