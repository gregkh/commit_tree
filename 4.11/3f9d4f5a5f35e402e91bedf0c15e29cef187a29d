KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Gather HPT related variables into sub-structure

Currently, the powerpc kvm_arch structure contains a number of variables
tracking the state of the guest's hashed page table (HPT) in KVM HV.  This
patch gathers them all together into a single kvm_hpt_info substructure.
This makes life more convenient for the upcoming HPT resizing
implementation.
