PCI: dwc: designware: Move register defines to designware header file

No functional change. Move the register defines and other macros from
pcie-designware.c to pcie-designware.h. This is in preparation to split the
pcie-designware.c file into designware core file and host-specific file.

While at that also fix a checkpatch warning.
