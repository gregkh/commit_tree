CIFS: remove bad_network_name flag

STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_NAME can be received during node failover,
causing the flag to be set and making the reconnect thread
always unsuccessful, thereafter.

Once the only place where it is set is removed, the remaining
bits are rendered moot.

Removing it does not prevent "mount" from failing when a non
existent share is passed.

What happens when the share really ceases to exist while the
share is mounted is undefined now as much as it was before.
