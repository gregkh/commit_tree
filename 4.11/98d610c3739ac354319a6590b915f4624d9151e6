platform/x86: acer-wmi: setup accelerometer when machine has appropriate notify event

The accelerometer event relies on the ACERWMID_EVENT_GUID notify.
So, this patch changes the codes to setup accelerometer input device
when detected ACERWMID_EVENT_GUID. It avoids that the accel input
device created on every Acer machines.

In addition, patch adds a clearly parsing logic of accelerometer hid
to acer_wmi_get_handle_cb callback function. It is positive matching
the "SENR" name with "BST0001" device to avoid non-supported hardware.
