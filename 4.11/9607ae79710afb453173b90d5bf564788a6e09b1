drm/i915/debugfs: Increment return value of gt.next_seqno

The i915_next_seqno read value is to be the next seqno used by the
kernel. However, in the conversion to atomics ops for gt.next_seqno, in
commit 28176ef4cfa5 ("drm/i915: Reserve space in the global seqno during
request allocation"), this was changed from a post-increment to a
pre-increment. This increment was missed from the value reported by
debugfs, so in effect it was reporting the current seqno (last
assigned), not the next seqno.
