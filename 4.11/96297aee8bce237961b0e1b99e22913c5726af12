ide: palm_bk3710: add __initdata to palm_bk3710_port_info

The object palm_bk3710_port_info of type ide_port_info is never
referenced anywhere after initialization by palm_bk3710_probe. It is
also passed as a parameter to ide_host_add which is called from the init
function but this call doesn't store the object reference anywhere, and
it only dereferences the values of the fields. Therefore add __initdata
to its declaration.
