net/mlx5e: Support bpf_xdp_adjust_head()

This patch adds bpf_xdp_adjust_head() support to mlx5e.

1. rx_headroom is added to struct mlx5e_rq.  It uses
   an existing 4 byte hole in the struct.
2. The adjusted data length is checked against
   MLX5E_XDP_MIN_INLINE and MLX5E_SW2HW_MTU(rq->netdev->mtu).
3. The macro MLX5E_SW2HW_MTU is moved from en_main.c to en.h.
   MLX5E_HW2SW_MTU is also moved to en.h for symmetric reason
   but it is not a must.

v2:
- Keep the xdp specific logic in mlx5e_xdp_handle()
- Update dma_len after the sanity checks in mlx5e_xmit_xdp_frame()
