net/mlx5e: fix another maybe-uninitialized false-positive

In commit abeffce ("net/mlx5e: Fix a -Wmaybe-uninitialized warning"), I fixed a
gcc warning for the ipv4 offload handling. Now we get the same warning for the
added ipv6 support:

drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/en_tc.c:815:40: warning: 'out_dev' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

We can apply the same workaround here as well.
