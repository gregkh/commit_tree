virtio_pci: remove struct virtio_pci_vq_info

We don't really need struct virtio_pci_vq_info, as most field in there
are redundant:

 - the vq backpointer is not strictly neede to start with
 - the entry in the vqs list is not needed - the generic virtqueue already
   has list, we only need to check if it has a callback to get the same
   semantics
 - we can use a simple array to look up the MSI-X vec if needed.
 - That simple array now also duoble serves to replace the per_vq_vectors
   flag
