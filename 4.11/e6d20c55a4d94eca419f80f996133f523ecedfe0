openrisc: entry: Fix delay slot detection

Use execption SR stored in pt_regs for detection, the current SR is not
correct as the handler is running after return from exception.

Also, The code that checks for a delay slot uses a flag bitmask and then
wants to check if the result is not zero.  The test it implemented was
wrong.

Correct it by changing the test to check result against non zero.
