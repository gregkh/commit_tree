ARM: dts: sun8i: Add audio codec, dai and card for A33

Add the audio codec, dai and a simple card to be able to use the
audio stream of the builtin codec on sun8i SoC.

This commit adds also an audio-routing for the sound card node to link
the analog DAPM widgets (Right/Left DAC) and the digital one's as they
are created in different drivers.
