drm/i915: Split up hangcheck phases

In order to simplify hangcheck state keeping, split hangcheck
per engine loop in three phases: state load, action, state save.

Add few more hangcheck actions to separate between seqno, head
and subunit movements. This helps to gather all the hangcheck
actions under a single switch umbrella.
