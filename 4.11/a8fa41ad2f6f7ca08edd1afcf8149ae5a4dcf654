mm, rmap: check all VMAs that PTE-mapped THP can be part of

Current rmap code can miss a VMA that maps PTE-mapped THP if the first
suppage of the THP was unmapped from the VMA.

We need to walk rmap for the whole range of offsets that THP covers, not
only the first one.

vma_address() also need to be corrected to check the range instead of
the first subpage.
