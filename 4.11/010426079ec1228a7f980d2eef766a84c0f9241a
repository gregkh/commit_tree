sched/headers: Prepare for new header dependencies before moving more code to <linux/sched/mm.h>

We are going to split more MM APIs out of <linux/sched.h>, which
will have to be picked up from a couple of .c files.

The APIs that we are going to move are:

  arch_pick_mmap_layout()
  arch_get_unmapped_area()
  arch_get_unmapped_area_topdown()
  mm_update_next_owner()

Include the header in the files that are going to need it.
