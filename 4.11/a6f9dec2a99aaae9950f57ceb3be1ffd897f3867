ALSA: cs46xx: constify snd_pcm_ops structures

Declare snd_pcm_ops structures as const as they are either stored in the
ops field of a snd_pcm_substream structure or passed as an argument to
the function snd_pcm_set_ops. The function argument and the ops field
are of type const, so snd_pcm_ops structures having this property
can be made const too.
