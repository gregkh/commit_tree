drm/i915: Recreate internal objects with single page segments if dmar fails

If we fail to dma-map the object, the most common cause is lack of space
inside the SW-IOTLB due to fragmentation. If we recreate the_sg_table
using segments of PAGE_SIZE (and single page allocations), we may succeed
in remapping the scatterlist.

First became a significant problem for the mock selftests after commit
5584f1b1d73e ("drm/i915: fix i915 running as dom0 under Xen") increased
the max_order.
