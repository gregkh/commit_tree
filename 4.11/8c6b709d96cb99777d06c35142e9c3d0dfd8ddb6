drm/i915: Use new CRC debugfs API

The core provides now an ABI to userspace for generation of frame CRCs,
so implement the ->set_crc_source() callback and reuse as much code as
possible with the previous ABI implementation.

When handling the pageflip interrupt, we skip 1 or 2 frames depending on
the HW because they contain wrong values. For the legacy ABI for
generating frame CRCs, this was done in userspace but now that we have a
generic ABI it's better if it's not exposed by the kernel.

v2:
    - Leave the legacy implementation in place as the ABI implementation
      in the core is incompatible with it.
v3:
    - Use the "cooked" vblank counter so we have a whole 32 bits.
    - Make sure we don't mess with the state of the legacy CRC capture
      ABI implementation.
v4:
    - Keep use of get_vblank_counter as in the legacy code, will be
      changed in a followup commit.

v5:
    - Skip first frame or two as it's known that they contain wrong
      data.
    - A few fixes suggested by Emil Velikov.

v6:
    - Rework programming of the HW registers to preserve previous
      behavior.

v7:
    - Address whitespace issue.
    - Added a comment on why in the implementation of the new ABI we
      skip the 1st or 2nd frames.

v9:
    - Add stub for intel_crtc_set_crc_source.

v12:
    - Rebased.
    - Remove stub for intel_crtc_set_crc_source and instead set the
      callback to NULL (Jani Nikula).

v15:
    - Rebased.
