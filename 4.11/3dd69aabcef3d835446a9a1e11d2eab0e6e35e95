ceph: add a new flag to indicate whether parent is locked

struct ceph_mds_request has an r_locked_dir pointer, which is set to
indicate the parent inode and that its i_rwsem is locked.  In some
critical places, we need to be able to indicate the parent inode to the
request handling code, even when its i_rwsem may not be locked.

Most of the code that operates on r_locked_dir doesn't require that the
i_rwsem be locked. We only really need it to handle manipulation of the
dcache. The rest (filling of the inode, updating dentry leases, etc.)
already has its own locking.

Add a new r_req_flags bit that indicates whether the parent is locked
when doing the request, and rename the pointer to "r_parent". For now,
all the places that set r_parent also set this flag, but that will
change in a later patch.
