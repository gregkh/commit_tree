kvm: arm/arm64: Fix locking for kvm_free_stage2_pgd

In kvm_free_stage2_pgd() we don't hold the kvm->mmu_lock while calling
unmap_stage2_range() on the entire memory range for the guest. This could
cause problems with other callers (e.g, munmap on a memslot) trying to
unmap a range. And since we have to unmap the entire Guest memory range
holding a spinlock, make sure we yield the lock if necessary, after we
unmap each PUD range.

Fixes: commit d5d8184d35c9 ("KVM: ARM: Memory virtualization setup")
