drm: mxsfb: Fix crash when provided invalid DT bindings

The mxsfb driver will crash if the mxsfb DT node has a subnode,
but the content of the subnode is not of-graph binding with an
endpoint linking to panel. The crash was triggered by providing
old-style panel bindings to the mxsfb driver instead of the new
of-graph ones.

The problem happens in mxsfb_create_output(), which is invoked
from mxsfb_load(). The mxsfb_create_output() iterates over all
mxsfb DT subnode endpoints and tries to bind a panel on each
endpoint. If there is any problem binding the panel, that is,
mxsfb->panel == NULL, this function will return an error code,
otherwise success 0 is returned.

If the subnodes do not specify of-graph binding with an endpoint,
the iteration over endpoints in mxsfb_create_output() will have
zero cycles and the function will immediatelly return 0, but the
mxsfb->panel will remain NULL. This is propagated back into the
mxsfb_load(), which does not detect any problem and expects that
the mxsfb->panel is valid, thus calls mxsfb_panel_attach(). But
since mxsfb->panel == NULL, mxsfb_panel_attach() is called with
first argument NULL and this crashes the kernel.

This patch fixes the problem by explicitly checking for valid
mxsfb->panel at the end of the iteration in mxsfb_create_output().
