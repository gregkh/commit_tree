tcmu: Convert cmd_time_out into backend device attribute

Instead of putting cmd_time_out under ../target/core/user_0/foo/control,
which has historically been used by parameters needed for initial
backend device configuration, go ahead and move cmd_time_out into
a backend device attribute.

In order to do this, tcmu_module_init() has been updated to create
a local struct configfs_attribute **tcmu_attrs, that is based upon
the existing passthrough_attrib_attrs along with the new cmd_time_out
attribute.  Once **tcm_attrs has been setup, go ahead and point
it at tcmu_ops->tb_dev_attrib_attrs so it's picked up by target-core.

Also following MNC's previous change, ->cmd_time_out is stored in
milliseconds but exposed via configfs in seconds.  Also, note this
patch restricts the modification of ->cmd_time_out to before +
after the TCMU device has been configured, but not while it has
active fabric exports.
