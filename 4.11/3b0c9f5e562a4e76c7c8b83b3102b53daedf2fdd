ARM: defconfig: replace MPU3050 driver on multi_v7

The multi_v7 config enable the MPU3050 gyro input driver, but
there is now a dedicated IIO gyro driver for the same component,
which is the right subsystem to handle this. Replace it in the
defconfig. As we want the full IIO featureset and as other v7
systems will likely enjoy using IIO for their sensor work (such
as the Android-to-IIO userspace HAL), we take this opportunity to
turn on the standard sensor HRtimer triggering.
