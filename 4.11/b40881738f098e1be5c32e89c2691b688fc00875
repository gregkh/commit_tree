ARM: davinci: da850: fix da850_set_pll0rate()

This function is confusing - its second argument is an index to the
freq table, not the requested clock rate in Hz, but it's used as the
set_rate callback for the pll0 clock. It leads to an oops when the
caller doesn't know the internals and passes the rate in Hz as
argument instead of the cpufreq index since this argument isn't bounds
checked either.

Fix it by iterating over the array of supported frequencies and
selecting a one that matches or returning -EINVAL for unsupported
rates.

Also: update the davinci cpufreq driver. It's the only user of this
clock and currently it passes the cpufreq table index to
clk_set_rate(), which is confusing. Make it pass the requested clock
rate in Hz.
