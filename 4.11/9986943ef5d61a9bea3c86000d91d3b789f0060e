ASoC: rcar: dma: remove unnecessary "volatile"

commit 2a3af642eb20("ASoC: rcar: clear DE bit only in PDMACHCR...")
added rsnd_dmapp_bset(), but it used copy-paste. Thus, it had
unnecessary "volatile", and had below warning on x86.
This patch fix it.

   sound/soc/sh/rcar/dma.c: In function 'rsnd_dmapp_bset':
