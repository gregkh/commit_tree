KVM: MIPS/MMU: Add GPA PT mkclean helper

Add a helper function to make a range of guest physical address (GPA)
mappings in the GPA page table clean so that writes can be caught. This
will be used in a few places to manage dirty page logging.

Note that until the dirty bit is transferred from GPA page table entries
to GVA page table entries in an upcoming patch this won't trigger a TLB
modified exception on write.
