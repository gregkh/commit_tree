KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: HPT resizing documentation and reserved numbers

This adds a new powerpc-specific KVM_CAP_SPAPR_RESIZE_HPT capability to
advertise whether KVM is capable of handling the PAPR extensions for
resizing the hashed page table during guest runtime.  It also adds
definitions for two new VM ioctl()s to implement this extension, and
documentation of the same.

Note that, HPT resizing is already possible with KVM PR without kernel
modification, since the HPT is managed within userspace (qemu).  The
capability defined here will only be set where an in-kernel implementation
of resizing is necessary, i.e. for KVM HV.  To determine if the userspace
resize implementation can be used, it's necessary to check
KVM_CAP_PPC_ALLOC_HTAB.  Unfortunately older kernels incorrectly set
KVM_CAP_PPC_ALLOC_HTAB even with KVM PR.  If userspace it want to support
resizing with KVM PR on such kernels, it will need a workaround.
