iio: adc: stm32: add optional dma support

Add DMA optional support to STM32 ADC, as there is a limited number DMA
channels (request lines) that can be assigned to ADC. This way, driver
may fall back using interrupts when all DMA channels are in use for
other IPs.
Use dma cyclic mode with two periods. Allow to tune period length by
using watermark. Coherent memory is used for dma (max buffer size is
fixed to PAGE_SIZE).
