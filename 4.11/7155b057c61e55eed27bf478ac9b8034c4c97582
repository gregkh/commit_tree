drm/i915: Retire before attempting to evict from the active lists

Some object retain an extra pin whilst they are active (e.g. contexts).
This excludes them from being considered for eviction unless we idle the
GPU. If before we look at the active list, we retire beforehand we can
hopefully remove a few excess pins and reduce the amount of searching
required.

v2: Similar principle applies to evict_for_vma
