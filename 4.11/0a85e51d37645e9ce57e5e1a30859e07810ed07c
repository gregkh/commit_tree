thp: reduce indentation level in change_huge_pmd()

Patch series "thp: fix few MADV_DONTNEED races"

For MADV_DONTNEED to work properly with huge pages, it's critical to not
clear pmd intermittently unless you hold down_write(mmap_sem).

Otherwise MADV_DONTNEED can miss the THP which can lead to userspace
breakage.

See example of such race in commit message of patch 2/4.

All these races are found by code inspection.  I haven't seen them
triggered.  I don't think it's worth to apply them to stable@.

This patch (of 4):

Restructure code in preparation for a fix.
