ALSA: hda - Fix click noises on Samsung Ativ Book 8

The Samsung Ativ Book 8 makes a loud click noise on boot, shutdown
and when the audio card enters or exits power saving states. All
these noises disappear applying ALC269_FIXUP_NO_SHUTUP.

In addition to that, fix the loud click noise that the laptop
makes when inserting or removing the headphone jack by automuting
via amp instead of pinctl.
