x86/MSR: Carve out bare minimum accessors

Add __rdmsr() and __wrmsr() which *only* read and write an MSR with
exception handling. Those are going to be used in early code, like the
microcode loader, which cannot stomach tracing code piggybacking on the
MSR operation.

While at it, get rid of __native_write_msr_notrace().
