CIFS: implement get_dfs_refer for SMB2+

in SMB2+ the get_dfs_refer operation uses a FSCTL. The request can be
made on any Tree Connection according to the specs. Since Samba only
accepted it on an IPC connection until recently, try that first.

3.2.4.20.3 Application Requests DFS Referral Information:
> The client MUST search for an existing Session and TreeConnect to any
> share on the server identified by ServerName for the user identified by
> UserCredentials. If no Session and TreeConnect are found, the client
> MUST establish a new Session and TreeConnect to IPC$ on the target
> server as described in section 3.2.4.2 using the supplied ServerName and
> UserCredentials.
