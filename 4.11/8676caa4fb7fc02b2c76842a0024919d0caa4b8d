s390/topology: correct allocation of topology information

The data stored by the STSI instruction can be up to a page in size
but the memblock_virt_alloc allocation for tl_info only specifies
16 bytes. The memory after the short allocation is overwritten
every time arch_update_cpu_topology is called.
