xen: modify xenstore watch event interface

Today a Xenstore watch event is delivered via a callback function
declared as:

void (*callback)(struct xenbus_watch *,
                 const char **vec, unsigned int len);

As all watch events only ever come with two parameters (path and token)
changing the prototype to:

void (*callback)(struct xenbus_watch *,
                 const char *path, const char *token);

is the natural thing to do.

Apply this change and adapt all users.
