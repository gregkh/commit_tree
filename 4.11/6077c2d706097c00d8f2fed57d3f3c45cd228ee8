dm rq: Avoid that request processing stalls sporadically

While running the srp-test software I noticed that request
processing stalls sporadically at the beginning of a test, namely
when mkfs is run against a dm-mpath device. Every time when that
happened the following command was sufficient to resume request
processing:

    echo run >/sys/kernel/debug/block/dm-0/state

This patch avoids that such request processing stalls occur. The
test I ran is as follows:

    while srp-test/run_tests -d -r 30 -t 02-mq; do :; done
