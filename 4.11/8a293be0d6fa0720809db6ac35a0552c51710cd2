core: migrate exception table users off module.h and onto extable.h

These files were including module.h for exception table related
functions.  We've now separated that content out into its own file
"extable.h" so now move over to that and where possible, avoid all
the extra header content in module.h that we don't really need to
compile these non-modular files.

Note:
   init/main.c still needs module.h for __init_or_module
   kernel/extable.c still needs module.h for is_module_text_address

...and so we don't get the benefit of removing module.h from the cpp
feed for these two files, unlike the almost universal 1:1 exchange
of module.h for extable.h we were able to do in the arch dirs.
