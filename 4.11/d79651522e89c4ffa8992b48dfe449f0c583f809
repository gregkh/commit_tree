drm/i915: Enable i915 perf stream for Haswell OA unit

Gen graphics hardware can be set up to periodically write snapshots of
performance counters into a circular buffer via its Observation
Architecture and this patch exposes that capability to userspace via the
i915 perf interface.

v2:
   Make sure to initialize ->specific_ctx_id when opening, without
   relying on _pin_notify hook, in case ctx already pinned.
v3:
   Revert back to pinning ctx upfront when opening stream, removing
   need to hook in to pinning and to update OACONTROL on the fly.
