tools headers: Sync {tools/,}arch/powerpc/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h, {tools/,}arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h and {tools/,}arch/arm/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h

The following upstream headers were updated:

 - The x86 cpufeatures.h file picked up a couple of new feature entries
 - The PowerPC and ARM KVM headers picked up new features

None of which requires changes to perf tooling, so refresh the tooling copy.

Solves these build time warnings:

 Warning: arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h differs from kernel
 Warning: arch/powerpc/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h differs from kernel
 Warning: arch/arm/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h differs from kernel
