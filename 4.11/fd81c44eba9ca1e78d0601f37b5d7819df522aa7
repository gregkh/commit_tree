drm/i915: Fix DP link rate math

We store DP link rates as link clock frequencies in kHz, just like all
other clock values. But, DP link rates in the DP Spec. are expressed in
Gbps/lane, which seems to have led to some confusion.

E.g., for HBR2
Max. data rate = 5.4 Gbps/lane x 4 lane x 8/10 x 1/8 = 2160000 kBps
where, 8/10 is for channel encoding and 1/8 is for bit to Byte conversion

Using link clock frequency, like we do
Max. data rate = 540000 kHz * 4 lanes = 2160000 kSymbols/s
Because, each symbol has 8 bit of data, this is 2160000 kBps
and there is no need to account for channel encoding here.

But, currently we do 540000 kHz * 4 lanes * (8/10) = 1728000 kBps

Similarly, while computing the required link bandwidth for a mode,
there is a mysterious 1/10 term.
This should simply be pixel_clock kHz * (bpp/8) to give the final result in
kBps
