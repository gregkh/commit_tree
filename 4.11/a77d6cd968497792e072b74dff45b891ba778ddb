acpi/processor: Check for duplicate processor ids at hotplug time

The check for duplicate processor ids happens at boot time based on the
ACPI table contents, but the final sanity checks for a processor happen
at hotplug time.

At hotplug time, where the physical information is available, which might
differ from the ACPI table information, a check for duplicate processor
ids is missing.

Add it to the hotplug checks and rename the function so it better
reflects its purpose.
