ASoC: hdac_hdmi: use audio component framework to read ELD

With codec read sometimes the pin_sense shows invalid monitor present
and eld_valid. Currently driver polls for few times to get the valid
eld data.

To avoid the latency, Instead of reading ELD from codec, read it
directly from the display driver using audio component framework.
and removed the unused direct codec helper functions.
