ath9k: indicate that the AR9003 EEPROM template values are little endian

The eepMisc field was not set explicitly. The default value of 0 means
that the values in the EEPROM (template) should be interpreted as little
endian. However, this is not clear until comparing the AR9003 code with
the other EEPROM formats.
To make the code easier to understand we explicitly state that the values
are little endian - there are no functional changes with this patch.
