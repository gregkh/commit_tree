via-cuda: Add support for Egret system controller

The Egret system controller was the predecessor to the Cuda and the
differences are minor.

On Cuda, byte acknowledgement requires one transition of the TACK
signal; on Egret two are needed. On Cuda, TIP is active low; on Egret
it is active high. And Cuda raises certain interrupts that Egret omits.

Accomodating these differences complicates the Cuda driver slightly
but avoids a lot of duplication (see next patch).
