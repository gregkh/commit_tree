mm: remove shmem_mapping() shmem_zero_setup() duplicates

Remove the prototypes for shmem_mapping() and shmem_zero_setup() from
linux/mm.h, since they are already provided in linux/shmem_fs.h.  But
shmem_fs.h must then provide the inline stub for shmem_mapping() when
CONFIG_SHMEM is not set, and a few more cfiles now need to #include it.
