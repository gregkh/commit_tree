ARCv2: intc: Rework the build time irq count information

Currently Kconfig knob ARC_NUMBER_OF_INTERRUPTS is used as indicator of
hard irq count. But it is flawed that it doesn't affect
 - NR_IRQS     : for number of virtual interrupts
 - NR_CPU_IRQS : for number of hardware interrupts

Moreover the actual hardware irq count might still not be same as
ARC_NUMBER_OF_INTERRUPTS. So use the information availble in the
Build Configuration Registers and get rid of the Kconfig option.

We still need "some" build time info about irq count to set up
sufficient number of vector table entries. This is done with a
sufficiently large NR_CPU_IRQS which will eventually be used soley for
that purpose (subsequent patches will remove its usage elsewhere)

So to summarize what this patch does:

  * NR_CPU_IRQS defines a maximum number of hardware interrupts.
  * Remove ARC_NUMBER_OF_INTERRUPTS option and create interrupts
    table for all possible hardware interrupts.
  * Increase a maximum number of virtual IRQs to 512. ARCv2 can
    support 240 interrupts in the core interrupts controllers
    and 128 interrupts in IDU. Thus 512 virtual IRQs must be
    enough for most configurations of boards.

This patch leads to NR_CPU_IRQS in 2 places, to reduce the overall
churn. The next patch will remove the 2nd definition anyways.
