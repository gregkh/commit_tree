blk-mq-sched: ask scheduler for work, if we failed dispatching leftovers

Usually we don't ask the scheduler for work, if we already have
leftovers on the dispatch list. This is done to leave work on
the scheduler side for as long as possible, for proper merging.
But if we do have work leftover but didn't dispatch anything,
then we should ask the scheduler since we could potentially
issue requests from that.
