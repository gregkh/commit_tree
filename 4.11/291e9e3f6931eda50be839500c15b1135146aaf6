HID: intel-ish-hid: ipc: check FW status to distinguish ISH resume paths

For ISH resume, there are two paths, they need different way to handle: one
where ISH is not powered off, in that case a simple resume message is enough,
in other case we need a reset sequence.

We can use ISH FW status to distinguish those two cases and handle them
properly.
