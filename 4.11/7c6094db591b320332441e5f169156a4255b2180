rcu: update: Make RCU_EXPEDITE_BOOT be the default

RCU_EXPEDITE_BOOT should speed up the boot process by enforcing
synchronize_rcu_expedited() instead of synchronize_rcu() during the boot
process. There should be no reason why one does not want this and there
is no need worry about real time latency at this point.
Therefore make it default.

Note that users wishing to avoid expediting entirely, for example when
bringing up new hardware possibly having flaky IPIs, can use the
rcu_normal boot parameter to override boot-time expediting.
