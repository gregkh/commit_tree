KVM: arm/arm64: Let vcpu thread modify its own active state

Currently, if a vcpu thread tries to change the active state of an
interrupt which is already on the same vcpu's AP list, it will loop
forever. Since the VGIC mmio handler is called after a vcpu has
already synced back the LR state to the struct vgic_irq, we can just
let it proceed safely.
