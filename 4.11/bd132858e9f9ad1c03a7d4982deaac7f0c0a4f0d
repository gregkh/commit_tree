drm/i915/huc: Add HuC fw loading support

The HuC loading process is similar to GuC. The intel_uc_fw_fetch()
is used for both cases.

HuC loading needs to be before GuC loading. The WOPCM setting must
be done early before loading any of them.

v2: rebased on-top of drm-intel-nightly.
    removed if(HAS_GUC()) before the guc call. (D.Gordon)
    update huc_version number of format.
v3: rebased to drm-intel-nightly, changed the file name format to
    match the one in the huc package.
    Changed dev->dev_private to to_i915()
v4: moved function back to where it was.
    change wait_for_atomic to wait_for.
v5: rebased. Changed the year in the copyright message to reflect
the right year.Correct the comments,remove the unwanted WARN message,
replace drm_gem_object_unreference() with i915_gem_object_put().Make the
prototypes in intel_huc.h non-extern.
v6: rebased. Update the file construction done by HuC. It is similar to
GuC.Adopted the approach used in-
https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/104355/ <Tvrtko Ursulin>
v7: Change dev to dev_priv in macro definition.
Corrected comments.
v8: rebased on top of drm-tip. Updated functions intel_huc_load(),
intel_huc_init() and intel_uc_fw_fetch() to accept dev_priv instead of
dev. Moved contents of intel_huc.h to intel_uc.h.
v9: change SKL_FW_ to SKL_HUC_FW_. Add intel_ prefix to guc_wopcm_size().
Remove unwanted checks in intel_uc.h. Rename huc_fw in struct intel_huc to
simply fw to avoid redundency.
v10: rebased. Correct comments. Make intel_huc_fini() accept dev_priv
instead of dev like intel_huc_init() and intel_huc_load().Move definition
to i915_guc_reg.h from intel_uc.h. Clean DMA_CTRL bits after HuC DMA
transfer in huc_ucode_xfer() instead of guc_ucode_xfer(). Add suitable
WARNs to give extra info.
v11: rebased. Add proper bias for HuC and make sure there are
asserts on failure by using guc_ggtt_offset_vma(). Introduce
intel_huc.c and remove intel_huc_loader.c since it has functions that
do more than just loading.Correct year in copyright.
v12: remove invalidates that are not required anymore.
