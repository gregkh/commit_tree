team: use ETH_MAX_MTU as max mtu

This restores the ability to set a team device's mtu to anything higher
than 1500. Similar to the reported issue with bonding, the team driver
calls ether_setup(), which sets an initial max_mtu of 1500, while the
underlying hardware can handle something much larger. Just set it to
ETH_MAX_MTU to support all possible values, and the limitations of the
underlying devices will prevent setting anything too large.
