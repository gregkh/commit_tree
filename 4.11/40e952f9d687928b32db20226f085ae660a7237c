mm: do not call mem_cgroup_free() from within mem_cgroup_alloc()

mem_cgroup_free() indirectly calls wb_domain_exit() which is not
prepared to deal with a struct wb_domain object that hasn't executed
wb_domain_init().  For instance, the following warning message is
printed by lockdep if alloc_percpu() fails in mem_cgroup_alloc():

  INFO: trying to register non-static key.
  the code is fine but needs lockdep annotation.
  turning off the locking correctness validator.

Add __mem_cgroup_free() which skips wb_domain_exit().  This is used by
both mem_cgroup_free() and mem_cgroup_alloc() clean up.
