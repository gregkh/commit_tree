mei: fix deadlock on mei reset

This patch fixes 'mei: synchronize irq before initiating a reset'
The patch had introduced a deadlock between irq thread and mei_reset()
as they are both holding the same device lock.

---> device_lock:
	mei_reset()
                        <---- interrupt thread
	                        device_lock
---> synchornize_irq()
       wait on interrupt thread == (dead lock)

The fix is to call synchronize_irq
prior to call locked mei_reset function.
