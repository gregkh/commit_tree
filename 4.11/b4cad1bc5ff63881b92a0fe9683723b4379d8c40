gpio: ws16c48: Utilize devm_ functions in driver probe callback

The devm_ resource manager functions allow memory to be automatically
released when a device is unbound. This patch takes advantage of the
resource manager functions and replaces the gpiochip_add_data call and
request_irq call with the devm_gpiochip_add_data call and
devm_request_irq call respectively. In addition, the ws16c48_remove
function has been removed as no longer necessary due to the use of the
relevant devm_ resource manager functions.
