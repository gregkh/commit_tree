drm: bridge: Link encoder and bridge in core code

Instead of linking encoders and bridges in every driver (and getting it
wrong half of the time, as many drivers forget to set the drm_bridge
encoder pointer), do so in core code. The drm_bridge_attach() function
needs the encoder and optional previous bridge to perform that task,
update all the callers.
