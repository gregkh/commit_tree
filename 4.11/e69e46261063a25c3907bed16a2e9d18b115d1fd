net: dsa: Do not clobber PHY link outside of state machine

Calling phy_read_status() means that we may call into
genphy_read_status() which in turn will use genphy_update_link() which
can make changes to phydev->link outside of the state machine's state
transitions. This is an invalid behavior that is now caught as of
811a919135b9 ("phy state machine: failsafe leave invalid RUNNING state")
