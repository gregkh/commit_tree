usb: chipidea: Configure phy for appropriate mode

When the qcom chipidea controller is used with an extcon, we need
to signal device mode or host mode to the phy so it can configure
itself for the correct mode. This should be done after the phy is
powered up, so that the register writes work correctly. Add in
the appropriate phy_set_mode() call here.
