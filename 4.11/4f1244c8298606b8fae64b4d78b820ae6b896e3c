block/sed-opal: allocate struct opal_dev dynamically

Insted of bloating the containing structure with it all the time this
allocates struct opal_dev dynamically.  Additionally this allows moving
the definition of struct opal_dev into sed-opal.c.  For this a new
private data field is added to it that is passed to the send/receive
callback.  After that a lot of internals can be made private as well.
