pinctrl: sunxi: make sun5i explicitly non-modular

We had all these corrected in commit 0c8c6ba00cbf ("pinctrl: sunxi:
make bool drivers explicitly non-modular") but this new one recently
crept in.

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

   drivers/pinctrl/sunxi/Kconfig:config PINCTRL_SUN5I
   drivers/pinctrl/sunxi/Kconfig:  def_bool MACH_SUN5I

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
