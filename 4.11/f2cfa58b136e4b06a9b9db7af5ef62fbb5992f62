char: lack of bool string made CONFIG_DEVPORT always on

Without a bool string present, using "# CONFIG_DEVPORT is not set" in
defconfig files would not actually unset devport. This esnured that
/dev/port was always on, but there are reasons a user may wish to
disable it (smaller kernel, attack surface reduction) if it's not being
used. Adding a message here in order to make this user visible.
