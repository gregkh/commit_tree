xprtrdma: Reduce required number of send SGEs

The MAX_SEND_SGES check introduced in commit 655fec6987be
("xprtrdma: Use gathered Send for large inline messages") fails
for devices that have a small max_sge.

Instead of checking for a large fixed maximum number of SGEs,
check for a minimum small number. RPC-over-RDMA will switch to
using a Read chunk if an xdr_buf has more pages than can fit in
the device's max_sge limit. This is considerably better than
failing all together to mount the server.

This fix supports devices that have as few as three send SGEs
available.
