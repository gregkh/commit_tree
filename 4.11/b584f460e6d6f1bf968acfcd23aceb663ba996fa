KVM: MIPS/MMU: Pass GPA PTE bits to KSeg0 GVA PTEs

Propagate the GPA PTE protection bits on to the GVA PTEs on a KSeg0
fault (except _PAGE_WRITE), rather than always overriding the
protection. This allows dirty page tracking to work in KSeg0 as a clear
dirty bit in the GPA PTE will propagate to the GVA PTEs.

This makes it simpler to use a single kvm_mips_map_page() to obtain both
the main GPA PTE and its buddy (which may be invalid), which also allows
memory regions to be fully accessible when they don't start and end on a
2*PAGE_SIZE boundary.
