iommu: Rename iommu_dm_regions into iommu_resv_regions

We want to extend the callbacks used for dm regions and
use them for reserved regions. Reserved regions can be
- directly mapped regions
- regions that cannot be iommu mapped (PCI host bridge windows, ...)
- MSI regions (because they belong to another address space or because
  they are not translated by the IOMMU and need special handling)

So let's rename the struct and also the callbacks.
