drm/i915: Add bannable context parameter

Now when driver has per context scoring of 'hanging badness'
and also subsequent hangs during short windows are allowed,
if there is progress made in between, it does not make sense
to expose a ban timing window as a context parameter anymore.

Let the scoring be the sole indicator for ban policy and substitute
ban period context parameter as a boolean to get/set context
bannable property.

v2: allow non root to opt into being banned (Chris)
