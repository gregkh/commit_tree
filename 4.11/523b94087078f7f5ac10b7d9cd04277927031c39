hv: make CPU offlining prevention fine-grained

Since commit e513229b4c38 ("Drivers: hv: vmbus: prevent cpu offlining on
newer hypervisors") cpu offlining was disabled. It is still true that we
can't offline CPUs which have VMBus channels bound to them but we may have
'free' CPUs (e.v. we booted with maxcpus= parameter and onlined CPUs after
VMBus was initialized), these CPUs may be disabled without issues.

In future, we may even allow closing CPUs which have only sub-channels
assinged to them by closing these sub-channels. All devices will continue
to work.
