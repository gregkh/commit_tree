oom-reaper: use madvise_dontneed() logic to decide if unmap the VMA

Logic on whether we can reap pages from the VMA should match what we
have in madvise_dontneed().  In particular, we should skip, VM_PFNMAP
VMAs, but we don't now.

Let's just extract condition on which we can shoot down pagesi from a
VMA with MADV_DONTNEED into separate function and use it in both places.
