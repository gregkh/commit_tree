c6x/ptrace: Remove useless PTRACE_SETREGSET implementation

gpr_set won't work correctly and can never have been tested, and the
correct behaviour is not clear due to the endianness-dependent task
layout.

So, just remove it.  The core code will now return -EOPNOTSUPPORT when
trying to set NT_PRSTATUS on this architecture until/unless a correct
implementation is supplied.
