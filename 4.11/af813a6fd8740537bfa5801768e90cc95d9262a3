ASoC: wm_adsp: Add mechanism to preload firmware on a core

As requirements to bring up audio paths are continuous getting tighter
and the DSP download to most ADSP devices happens over an external bus
it can become an important factor in the path bring up time. As such
sometimes it is a reasonable trade off to download the firmware ahead of
when it will be required and take a small hit on power consumption for
keeping the core powered up.

This "preloading" adds an additional control for each DSP core "DSPx
Preload Switch" that when set to true will power up the DSP core and
download the firmware currently selected in the "DSPx Firmware" control.
Whilst the core is preloaded the current firmware can not be changed and
the CODEC will be kept powered up and SYSCLK held on. Although future
improvements may allow the SYSCLK to be powered down as well because
the hardware only requires SYSCLK whilst the download is actually taking
place, but this is not covered in this series.
