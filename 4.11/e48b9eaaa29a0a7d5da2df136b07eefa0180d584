s390/qeth: fix retrieval of vipa and proxy-arp addresses

qeth devices in layer3 mode need a separate handling of vipa and proxy-arp
addresses. vipa and proxy-arp addresses processed by qeth can be read from
userspace. Introduced with commit 5f78e29ceebf ("qeth: optimize IP handling
in rx_mode callback") the retrieval of vipa and proxy-arp addresses is
broken, if more than one vipa or proxy-arp address are set.

The qeth code used local variable "int i" for 2 different purposes. This
patch now spends 2 separate local variables of type "int".
While touching these functions hash_for_each_safe() is converted to
hash_for_each(), since there is no removal of hash entries.
