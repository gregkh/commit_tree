netvsc: handle select_queue when device is being removed

Move the send indirection table from the inner device (netvsc)
to the network device context.

It is possible that netvsc_device is not present (remove in progress).
This solves potential use after free issues when packet is being
created during MTU change, shutdown, or queue count changes.
