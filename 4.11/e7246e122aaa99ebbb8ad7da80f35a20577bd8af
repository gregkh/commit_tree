net-tc: extract skip classify bit from tc_verd

Packets sent by the IFB device skip subsequent tc classification.
A single bit governs this state. Move it out of tc_verd in
anticipation of removing that __u16 completely.

The new bitfield tc_skip_classify temporarily uses one bit of a
hole, until tc_verd is removed completely in a follow-up patch.

Remove the bit hole comment. It could be 2, 3, 4 or 5 bits long.
With that many options, little value in documenting it.

Introduce a helper function to deduplicate the logic in the two
sites that check this bit.

The field tc_skip_classify is set only in IFB on skbs cloned in
act_mirred, so original packet sources do not have to clear the
bit when reusing packets (notably, pktgen and octeon).
