powernv:stop: Rename pnv_arch300_idle_init to pnv_power9_idle_init

Balbir pointed out that the name of the function pnv_arch300_idle_init
was inconsistent with the names of the variables and functions
pertaining to POWER9 features in book3s_idle.S.

This patch renames pnv_arch300_idle_init to pnv_power9_idle_init.

This patch does not change any behaviour.
