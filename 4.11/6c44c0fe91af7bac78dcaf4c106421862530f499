scsi: mpt3sas: Added print to notify cable running at a degraded speed.

Driver processes the event MPI26_EVENT_ACTIVE_CABLE_DEGRADED when a
cable is present and is running at a degraded speed (below the SAS3 12
Gb/s rate). Prints added to inform the user that the cable is not
running at optimal speed.
