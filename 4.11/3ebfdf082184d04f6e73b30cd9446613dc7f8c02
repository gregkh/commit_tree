sctp: get sock from transport in sctp_transport_update_pmtu

This patch is almost to revert commit 02f3d4ce9e81 ("sctp: Adjust PMTU
updates to accomodate route invalidation."). As t->asoc can't be NULL
in sctp_transport_update_pmtu, it could get sk from asoc, and no need
to pass sk into that function.

It is also to remove some duplicated codes from that function.
