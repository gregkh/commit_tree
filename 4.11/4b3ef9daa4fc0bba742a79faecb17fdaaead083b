mm/swap: split swap cache into 64MB trunks

The patch is to improve the scalability of the swap out/in via using
fine grained locks for the swap cache.  In current kernel, one address
space will be used for each swap device.  And in the common
configuration, the number of the swap device is very small (one is
typical).  This causes the heavy lock contention on the radix tree of
the address space if multiple tasks swap out/in concurrently.

But in fact, there is no dependency between pages in the swap cache.  So
that, we can split the one shared address space for each swap device
into several address spaces to reduce the lock contention.  In the
patch, the shared address space is split into 64MB trunks.  64MB is
chosen to balance the memory space usage and effect of lock contention
reduction.

The size of struct address_space on x86_64 architecture is 408B, so with
the patch, 6528B more memory will be used for every 1GB swap space on
x86_64 architecture.

One address space is still shared for the swap entries in the same 64M
trunks.  To avoid lock contention for the first round of swap space
allocation, the order of the swap clusters in the initial free clusters
list is changed.  The swap space distance between the consecutive swap
clusters in the free cluster list is at least 64M.  After the first
round of allocation, the swap clusters are expected to be freed
randomly, so the lock contention should be reduced effectively.
