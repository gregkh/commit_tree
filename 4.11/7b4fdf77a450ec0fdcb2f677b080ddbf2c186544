netfilter: don't track fragmented packets

Andrey reports syzkaller splat caused by

NF_CT_ASSERT(!ip_is_fragment(ip_hdr(skb)));

in ipv4 nat.  But this assertion (and the comment) are wrong, this function
does see fragments when IP_NODEFRAG setsockopt is used.

As conntrack doesn't track packets without complete l4 header, only the
first fragment is tracked.

Because applying nat to first packet but not the rest makes no sense this
also turns off tracking of all fragments.
