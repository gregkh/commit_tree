ath10k: add debugfs support to get per peer tids log via tracing

This patch provides support to get per peer tids log.

echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phyX/netdev\:wlanX/stations/
XX:XX/peer_debug_trigger

These logs will be the part of FWLOGS which we collect the logs
via tracing interface. Here we will get the peer tigd logs only
once(not repeatedly) when we write 1 to the debugfs file.
