block: Initialize bd_bdi on inode initialization

So far we initialized bd_bdi only in bdget(). That is fine for normal
bdev inodes however for the special case of the root inode of
blockdev_superblock that function is never called and thus bd_bdi is
left uninitialized. As a result bdev_evict_inode() may oops doing
bdi_put(root->bd_bdi) on that inode as can be seen when doing:

mount -t bdev none /mnt

Fix the problem by initializing bd_bdi when first allocating the inode
and then reinitializing bd_bdi in bdev_evict_inode().

Thanks to syzkaller team for finding the problem.
