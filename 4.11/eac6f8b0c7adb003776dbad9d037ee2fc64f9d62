powerpc: Correctly disable latent entropy GCC plugin on prom_init.o

Commit 38addce8b600 ("gcc-plugins: Add latent_entropy plugin") excludes
certain powerpc early boot code from the latent entropy plugin by adding
appropriate CFLAGS. It looks like this was supposed to cover
prom_init.o, but ended up saying init.o (which doesn't exist) instead.
Fix the typo.
