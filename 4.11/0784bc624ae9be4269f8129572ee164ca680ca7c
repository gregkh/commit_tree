drm/i915: more .is_mobile cleanups for BDW

Commit 8d9c20e1d1e3 ("drm/i915: Remove .is_mobile field from platform
struct") removed mobile vs desktop differences for HSW+, but forgot
the Broadwell reserved IDs, so do it now.

It's interesting to notice that these IDs are used by early-quirks.c
but are *not* used by i915_pci.c.
