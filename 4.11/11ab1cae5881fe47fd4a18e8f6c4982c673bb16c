EDAC, amd64: Rework messages in ecc_enabled()

Print the node number when informing that DRAM ECC is disabled so
that we can show which nodes have DRAM ECC disabled. Also, print more
detailed system information as edac_dbg(), so as to not bother general
users.

Switch amd64_notice to amd64_info to match the message above it.
