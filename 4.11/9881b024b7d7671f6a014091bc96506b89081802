sched/clock: Delay switching sched_clock to stable

Currently we switch to the stable sched_clock if we guess the TSC is
usable, and then switch back to the unstable path if it turns out TSC
isn't stable during SMP bringup after all.

Delay switching to the stable path until after SMP bringup is
complete. This way we'll avoid switching during the time we detect the
worst of the TSC offences.
