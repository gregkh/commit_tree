sctp: check duplicate node before inserting a new transport

sctp has changed to use rhlist for transport rhashtable since commit
7fda702f9315 ("sctp: use new rhlist interface on sctp transport
rhashtable").

But rhltable_insert_key doesn't check the duplicate node when inserting
a node, unlike rhashtable_lookup_insert_key. It may cause duplicate
assoc/transport in rhashtable. like:

 client (addr A, B)                 server (addr X, Y)
    connect to X           INIT (1)
                        ------------>
    connect to Y           INIT (2)
                        ------------>
                         INIT_ACK (1)
                        <------------
                         INIT_ACK (2)
                        <------------

After sending INIT (2), one transport will be created and hashed into
rhashtable. But when receiving INIT_ACK (1) and processing the address
params, another transport will be created and hashed into rhashtable
with the same addr Y and EP as the last transport. This will confuse
the assoc/transport's lookup.

This patch is to fix it by returning err if any duplicate node exists
before inserting it.
