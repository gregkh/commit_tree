drm/vmwgfx: fix integer overflow in vmw_surface_define_ioctl()

In vmw_surface_define_ioctl(), the 'num_sizes' is the sum of the
'req->mip_levels' array. This array can be assigned any value from
the user space. As both the 'num_sizes' and the array is uint32_t,
it is easy to make 'num_sizes' overflow. The later 'mip_levels' is
used as the loop count. This can lead an oob write. Add the check of
'req->mip_levels' to avoid this.
