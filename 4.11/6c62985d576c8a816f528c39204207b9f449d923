x86/paravirt: Change vcp_is_preempted() arg type to long

The cpu argument in the function prototype of vcpu_is_preempted()
is changed from int to long. That makes it easier to provide a better
optimized assembly version of that function.

For Xen, vcpu_is_preempted(long) calls xen_vcpu_stolen(int), the
downcast from long to int is not a problem as vCPU number won't exceed
32 bits.
