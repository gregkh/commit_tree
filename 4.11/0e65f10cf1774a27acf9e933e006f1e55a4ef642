mmc: block: respect bool returned from blk_end_request()

The return value from blk_end_request() is a bool but is
treated like an int. This is generally safe, but the variable
also has the opaque name "ret" and gets returned from the
helper function mmc_blk_cmd_err().

- Switch the variable to a bool, applies everywhere.

- Return a bool from mmc_blk_cmd_err() and rename the function
  mmc_blk_rw_cmd_err() to indicate through the namespace that
  this is a helper for mmc_blk_issue_rw_rq().

- Rename the variable from "ret" to "req_pending" inside the
  while() loop inside mmc_blk_issue_rq_rq(), which finally
  makes it very clear what this while loop is waiting for.

- Augment the argument "ret" to mmc_blk_rq_cmd_err() to
  old_req_pending so it becomes evident that this is an
  older state, and it is returned only if we fail to get
  the number of written blocks from an SD card in the
  function mmc_sd_num_wr_blocks().

- Augment the while() loop in mmc_blk_rq_cmd_abort(): it
  is evident now that we know this is a bool variable,
  that the function is just spinning waiting for
  blk_end_request() to return false.
