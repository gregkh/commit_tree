s390/mem_detect: add debugging output

The s390 specific memory detection code does not call memblock_add,
which would generate debug output if memblock=debug is specified on
the kernel command line. Instead it directly calls memblock_add_range,
which doesn't generate any debug output.
To have a chance to debug early memblock related bugs add an s390
specific memblock_dbg call and a (missing) memblock_dump_all call.
