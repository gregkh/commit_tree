tracing: Add #undef to fix compile error

There are several trace include files that define TRACE_INCLUDE_FILE.

Include several of them in the same .c file (as I currently have in
some code I am working on), and the compile will blow up with a
"warning: "TRACE_INCLUDE_FILE" redefined #define TRACE_INCLUDE_FILE syscalls"

Every other include file in include/trace/events/ avoids that issue
by having a #undef TRACE_INCLUDE_FILE before the #define; syscalls.h
should have one, too.
