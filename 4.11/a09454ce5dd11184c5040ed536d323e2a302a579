scsi: megaraid_sas: In validate raid map, raid capability is not converted to cpu format for all lds

On a host, if an ld is deleted there is a hole in the ld array returned
by the FW. But in MR_ValidateMapInfo we are not accounting for holes in
the ld array and traverse only upto index num_lds.  This patch takes
care of converting the capability field of all the valid lds in the ld
raid map.
