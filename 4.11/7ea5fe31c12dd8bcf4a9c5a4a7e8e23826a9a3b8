blk-mq: make lifetime consitent between q/ctx and its kobject

Currently from kobject view, both q->mq_kobj and ctx->kobj can
be released during one cycle of blk_mq_register_dev() and
blk_mq_unregister_dev(). Actually, sw queue's lifetime is
same with its request queue's, which is covered by request_queue->kobj.

So we don't need to call kobject_put() for the two kinds of
kobject in __blk_mq_unregister_dev(), instead we do that
in release handler of request queue.
