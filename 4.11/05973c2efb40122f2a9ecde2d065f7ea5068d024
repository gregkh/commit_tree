orangefs: Dan Carpenter influenced cleanups...

This patch is simlar to one Dan Carpenter sent me, cleans
up some return codes and whitespace errors. There was one
place where he thought inserting an error message into
the ring buffer might be too chatty, I hope I convinced him
othewise. As a consolation <g> I changed a truly chatty
error message in another location into a debug message,
system-admins had already yelled at me about that one...
