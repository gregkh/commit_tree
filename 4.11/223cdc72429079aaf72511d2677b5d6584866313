net/mlx5: Update PAGE_FAULT_RESUME layout

Update PAGE_FAULT_RESUME command layout.

Three bit fields describing page fault: rdma, rdma_write, req_res gave 8
possible combinations, while only a few were legal. Now they
are interpreted as three-bit type field, where former legal
combinations turns into corresponding types and unused were added as new
types.
