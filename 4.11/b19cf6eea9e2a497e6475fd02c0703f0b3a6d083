ixgbevf: fix AER error handling

Make sure that we free the IRQs in ixgbevf_io_error_detected() when
responding to an PCIe AER error and also restore them when the
interface recovers from it.

Previously it was possible to trigger BUG_ON() check in free_msix_irqs()
in the case where we call ixgbevf_remove() after a failed recovery from
AER error because the interrupts were not freed.

Also moved the down and free functions into ixgbevf_close_suspend()
same as with ixgbe.
