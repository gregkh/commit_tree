tcp: remove RFC4653 NCR

This patch removes the (partial) implementation of the aggressive
limited transmit in RFC4653 TCP Non-Congestion Robustness (NCR).

NCR is a mitigation to the problem created by the dynamic
DUPACK threshold.  With the current adaptive DUPACK threshold
(tp->reordering) could cause timeouts by preventing fast recovery.
For example, if the last packet of a cwnd burst was reordered, the
threshold will be set to the size of cwnd. But if next application
burst is smaller than threshold and has drops instead of reorderings,
the sender would not trigger fast recovery but instead resorts to a
timeout recovery.

NCR mitigates this issue by checking the number of DUPACKs against
the current flight size additionally. The techniqueue is similar to
the early retransmit RFC.

With RACK loss detection, this mitigation is not needed, because RACK
does not use DUPACK threshold to detect losses. RACK arms a reordering
timer to fire at most a quarter RTT later to start fast recovery.
