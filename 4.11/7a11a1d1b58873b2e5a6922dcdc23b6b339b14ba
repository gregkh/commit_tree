lkdtm: hide stack overflow warning for corrupt-stack test

After the latest change to make sure the compiler actually does a memset,
it is now smart enough to flag the stack overflow at compile time,
at least with gcc-7.0:

drivers/misc/lkdtm_bugs.c: In function 'lkdtm_CORRUPT_STACK':
drivers/misc/lkdtm_bugs.c:88:144: warning: 'memset' writing 64 bytes into a region of size 8 overflows the destination [-Wstringop-overflow=]

To outsmart the compiler again, this moves the memset into a noinline
function where (for now) it doesn't see that we intentionally write
broken code here.
