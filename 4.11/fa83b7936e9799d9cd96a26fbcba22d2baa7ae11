RDMA/core: Unify style of IOCTL commands

MAD and HFI1 have different naming convention, this patch
simplifies and unifies their defines and names.

As part of cleanup, the HFI1 _NUM() macro and command indexes
were removed (controversial). This will cause intentional (and
arguably unnecessary) breakage to the PSM user space library.
