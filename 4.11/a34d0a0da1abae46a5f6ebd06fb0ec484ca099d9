ath9k_hw: check if the chip failed to wake up

In an RFC patch, Sven Eckelmann and Simon Wunderlich reported:

"QCA 802.11n chips (especially AR9330/AR9340) sometimes end up in a
state in which a read of AR_CFG always returns 0xdeadbeef.
This should not happen when when the power_mode of the device is
ATH9K_PM_AWAKE."

Include the check for the default register state in the existing MAC
hang check.
