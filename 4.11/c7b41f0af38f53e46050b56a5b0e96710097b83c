irqdomain: irq_domain_check_msi_remap

This new function checks whether all MSI irq domains
implement IRQ remapping. This is useful to understand
whether VFIO passthrough is safe with respect to interrupts.

On ARM typically an MSI controller can sit downstream
to the IOMMU without preventing VFIO passthrough.
As such any assigned device can write into the MSI doorbell.
In case the MSI controller implements IRQ remapping, assigned
devices will not be able to trigger interrupts towards the
host. On the contrary, the assignment must be emphasized as
unsafe with respect to interrupts.
