brcmfmac: add support for BCM43455 with modalias sdio:c00v02D0dA9BF

BCM43455 is a more recent revision of the BCM4345. Some of the BCM43455
got a dedicated SDIO device ID which is currently not supported by
brcmfmac.
Adding the new sdio_device_id to brcmfmac is enough to get the BCM43455
supported because the chip itself is already supported (due to BCM4345
support in the driver).
