iommu/arm-smmu-v3: limit use of 2-level stream tables

In the current arm-smmu-v3 driver, all smmus that support 2-level
stream tables are being forced to use them. This is suboptimal for
smmus that support fewer stream id bits than would fill in a single
second level table. This patch limits the use of 2-level tables to
smmus that both support the feature and whose first level table can
possibly contain more than a single entry.
