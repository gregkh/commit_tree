afs: Handle a short write to an AFS page

Handle the situation where afs_write_begin() is told to expect that a
full-page write will be made, but this doesn't happen (EFAULT, CTRL-C,
etc.), and so afs_write_end() sees a partial write took place.  Currently,
no attempt is to deal with the discrepency.

Fix this by loading the gap from the server.
