sched/core: Remove unlikely() annotation from sched_move_task()

The check for 'running' in sched_move_task() has an unlikely() around it. That
is, it is unlikely that the task being moved is running. That use to be
true. But with a couple of recent updates, it is now likely that the task
will be running.

The first change came from ea86cb4b7621 ("sched/cgroup: Fix
cpu_cgroup_fork() handling") that moved around the use case of
sched_move_task() in do_fork() where the call is now done after the task is
woken (hence it is running).

The second change came from 8e5bfa8c1f84 ("sched/autogroup: Do not use
autogroup->tg in zombie threads") where sched_move_task() is called by the
exit path, by the task that is exiting. Hence it too is running.
