mmc: use empty initializer list to zero-clear structures

In the MMC subsystem, we see such initializers that only clears the
first member explicitly.

For example,

  struct mmc_request mrq = {NULL};

sets the first member (.sbc) to NULL explicitly.  However, this is
an unstable form because we may insert a non-pointer member at the
top of the struct mmc_request in the future. (if we do so, the
compiler will spit warnings.)

So, using a designated initializer is preferred coding style.  The
expression above is equivalent to:

  struct mmc_request mrq = { .sbc = NULL };

Of course, this does not express our intention.  We want to fill
all struct members with zeros.  Please note struct members are
implicitly zero-cleared unless otherwise specified in the initializer.

After all, the most reasonable (and stable) form is:

  struct mmc_request mrq = {};

Do likewise for mmc_command, mmc_data as well.
