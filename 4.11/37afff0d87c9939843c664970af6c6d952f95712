misc: sram: Integrate protect-exec reserved sram area type

Introduce a new "protect-exec" reserved sram area type which is
makes use of the the existing functionality provided for the "pool"
sram region type for use with the genalloc framework and with the
added requirement that it be maintained as read-only and executable
while allowing for an arbitrary number of drivers to share the space.

This introduces a common way to maintain a region of sram as read-only
and executable and also introduces a helper function, sram_exec_copy,
which allows for copying data to this protected region while maintaining
locking to avoid conflicts between multiple users of the same space. A
region of memory that is marked with the "protect-exec" flag in the
device tree also has the requirement of providing a page aligned block
of memory so that the page attribute manipulation does not affect
surrounding regions.

Also, selectively enable this only for builds that support set_memory_*
calls, for now just ARM, through the use of Kconfig.
