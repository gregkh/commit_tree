[media] dw2102: don't do DMA on stack

On Kernel 4.9, WARNINGs about doing DMA on stack are hit at
the dw2102 driver: one in su3000_power_ctrl() and the other in tt_s2_4600_frontend_attach().

Both were due to the use of buffers on the stack as parameters to
dvb_usb_generic_rw() and the resulting attempt to do DMA with them.

The device was non-functional as a result.

So, switch this driver over to use a buffer within the device state
structure, as has been done with other DVB-USB drivers.

Tested with TechnoTrend TT-connect S2-4600.
