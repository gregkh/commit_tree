rtlwifi: rtl8723be: btcoexist: Add single_ant_path

Some devices with RTL8732BE wifi/Bluetooth adapters are shipped with only
a single antenna. On a subset of these, the EEPROM is incorectly coded
to indicate the wrong connection. The resulting problems have been fixed
for wifi. This change handles them for BT.
