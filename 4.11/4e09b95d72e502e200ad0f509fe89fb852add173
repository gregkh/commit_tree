drm/msm: drop quirks binding

This was never documented or used in upstream dtb.  It is used by
downstream bindings from android device kernels.  But the quirks are
a property of the gpu revision, and as such are redundant to be listed
separately in dt.  Instead, move the quirks to the device table.
