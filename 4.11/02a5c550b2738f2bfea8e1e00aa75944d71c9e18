rcu: Abstract extended quiescent state determination

This commit is the fourth step towards full abstraction of all accesses
to the ->dynticks counter, implementing previously open-coded checks and
comparisons in new rcu_dynticks_in_eqs() and rcu_dynticks_in_eqs_since()
functions.  This abstraction will ease changes to the ->dynticks counter
operation.
