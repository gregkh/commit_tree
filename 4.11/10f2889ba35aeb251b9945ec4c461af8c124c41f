drm: mxsfb: use bus_format to determine LCD bus width

The LCD bus width does not need to align with the pixel format. The
LCDIF controller automatically converts between pixel formats and
bus width by padding or dropping LSBs.

The DRM subsystem has the notion of bus_format which allows to
determine what bus_formats are supported by the display. Choose the
first available or fallback to 24 bit if none are available.
