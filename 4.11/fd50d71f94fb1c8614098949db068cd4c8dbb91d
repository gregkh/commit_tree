hwrng: core - Move hwrng miscdev minor number to include/linux/miscdevice.h

This patch move the define for hwrng's miscdev minor number to
include/linux/miscdevice.h.
It's better that all minor number are in the same place.
Rename it to HWRNG_MINOR (from RNG_MISCDEV_MINOR) in he process since
no other miscdev define have MISCDEV in their name.
