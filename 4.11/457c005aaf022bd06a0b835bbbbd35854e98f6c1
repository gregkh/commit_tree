staging: gdm724x: update HCI structs with new bitwise types

Update the driver's HCI structs and associated endian-converter
functions with new driver-specific bitwise types. The new types
encourage correct endian-handling within the driver by triggering
sparse warnings when mixing with other types. The driver's
endian-converters provide correct and warning-free conversions.

Driver-specific bitwise types are used instead of the standard
endian-specific types because the attached device can be of either
endian. This is also why the driver has its own endian-conversion
functions, which consider endianness of both the cpu and the attached
device.

Introducing the new types to the converters fixes the sparse warnings:
