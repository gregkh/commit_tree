RDMA/core: Fix incorrect structure packing for booleans

The RDMA core uses ib_pack() to convert from unpacked CPU structs
to on-the-wire bitpacked structs.

This process requires that 1 bit fields are declared as u8 in the
unpacked struct, otherwise the packing process does not read the
value properly and the packed result is wired to 0. Several
places wrongly used int.

Crucially this means the kernel has never, set reversible
correctly in the path record request. It has always asked for
irreversible paths even if the ULP requests otherwise.

When the kernel is used with a SM that supports this feature, it
completely breaks communication management if reversible paths are
not properly requested.

The only reason this ever worked is because opensm ignores the
reversible bit.
