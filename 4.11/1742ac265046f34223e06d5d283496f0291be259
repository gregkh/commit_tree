MIPS: VDSO: avoid duplicate CAC_BASE definition

vdso.h includes <spaces.h> implicitly after defining CONFIG_32BITS.
This defeats the override in mach-ip27/spaces.h, leading to
a build error that shows up in kernelci.org:

In file included from arch/mips/include/asm/mach-ip27/spaces.h:29:0,
                 from arch/mips/include/asm/page.h:12,
                 from arch/mips/vdso/vdso.h:26,
                 from arch/mips/vdso/gettimeofday.c:11:
arch/mips/include/asm/mach-generic/spaces.h:28:0: error: "CAC_BASE" redefined [-Werror]
 #define CAC_BASE  _AC(0x80000000, UL)

An earlier patch tried to make the second definition conditional,
but that patch had the #ifdef in the wrong place, and would lead
to another warning:

arch/mips/include/asm/io.h: In function 'phys_to_virt':
arch/mips/include/asm/io.h:138:9: error: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Werror=int-to-pointer-cast]

For all I can tell, there is no other reason than vdso32 to ever
include this file with CONFIG_32BITS set, and the vdso itself should
never refer to the base addresses as it is running in user space,
so adding an #ifdef here is safe.
