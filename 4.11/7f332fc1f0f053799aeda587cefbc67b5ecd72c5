arm64: Add support for DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC attribute to swiotlb

This patch adds support for DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC attribute for
dma_{un}map_{page,sg} functions family to swiotlb.

DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC allows platform code to skip synchronization of
the CPU cache for the given buffer assuming that it has been already
transferred to 'device' domain.

Ported from IOMMU .{un}map_{sg,page} ops.
