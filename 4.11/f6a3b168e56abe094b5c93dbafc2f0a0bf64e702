KVM: Return directly after a failed copy_from_user() in kvm_vm_compat_ioctl()

* Return directly after a call of the function "copy_from_user" failed
  in a case block.

  This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.

* Delete the jump label "out" which became unnecessary with
  this refactoring.
