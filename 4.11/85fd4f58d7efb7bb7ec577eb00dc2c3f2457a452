drm/i915: Mark all non-vma being inserted into the address spaces

We need to distinguish between full i915_vma structs and simple
drm_mm_nodes when considering eviction (i.e. we must be careful not to
treat a mere drm_mm_node as a much larger i915_vma causing memory
corruption, if we are lucky). To do this, color these not-a-vma with -1
(I915_COLOR_UNEVICTABLE).

v2...v200: New name for -1.
