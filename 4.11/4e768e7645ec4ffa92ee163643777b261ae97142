scsi: ufs: add capability to keep auto bkops always enabled

UFS device requires to perform bkops (back ground operations) periodically
but host can control (via auto-bkops parameter of device) when device can
perform bkops based on its performance requirements. In general, host
would like to enable the device's auto-bkops only when it's not doing any
regular data transfer but sometimes device may not behave properly if host
keeps the auto-bkops disabled. This change adds the capability to let the
device auto-bkops always enabled except suspend.
