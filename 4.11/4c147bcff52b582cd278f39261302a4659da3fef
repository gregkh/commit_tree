crypto: atmel - fix 64-bit build warnings

When we enable COMPILE_TEST building for the Atmel sha and tdes implementations,
we run into a couple of warnings about incorrect format strings, e.g.

In file included from include/linux/platform_device.h:14:0,
                 from drivers/crypto/atmel-sha.c:24:
drivers/crypto/atmel-sha.c: In function 'atmel_sha_xmit_cpu':
drivers/crypto/atmel-sha.c:571:19: error: format '%d' expects argument of type 'int', but argument 6 has type 'size_t {aka long unsigned int}' [-Werror=format=]
In file included from include/linux/printk.h:6:0,
                 from include/linux/kernel.h:13,
                 from drivers/crypto/atmel-tdes.c:17:
drivers/crypto/atmel-tdes.c: In function 'atmel_tdes_crypt_dma_stop':
include/linux/kern_levels.h:4:18: error: format '%u' expects argument of type 'unsigned int', but argument 2 has type 'size_t {aka long unsigned int}' [-Werror=format=]

These are all fixed by using the "%z" modifier for size_t data.

There are also a few uses of min()/max() with incompatible types:

drivers/crypto/atmel-tdes.c: In function 'atmel_tdes_crypt_start':
drivers/crypto/atmel-tdes.c:528:181: error: comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a cast [-Werror]

Where possible, we should use consistent types here, otherwise we can use
min_t()/max_t() to get well-defined behavior without a warning.
