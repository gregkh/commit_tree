sparc64: Use LOCKDEP_SMALL, not PROVE_LOCKING_SMALL

CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING_SMALL shrinks the memory usage of lockdep so the
kernel text, data, and bss fit in the required 32MB limit, but this
option is not set for every config that enables lockdep.

A 4.10 kernel fails to boot with the console output

    Kernel: Using 8 locked TLB entries for main kernel image.
    hypervisor_tlb_lock[2000000:0:8000000071c007c3:1]: errors with f
    Program terminated

with these config options

    CONFIG_LOCKDEP=y
    CONFIG_LOCK_STAT=y
    CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING=n

To fix, rename CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING_SMALL to CONFIG_LOCKDEP_SMALL, and
enable this option with CONFIG_LOCKDEP=y so we get the reduced memory
usage every time lockdep is turned on.

Tested that CONFIG_LOCKDEP_SMALL is set to 'y' if and only if
CONFIG_LOCKDEP is set to 'y'.  When other lockdep-related config options
that select CONFIG_LOCKDEP are enabled (e.g. CONFIG_LOCK_STAT or
CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING), verified that CONFIG_LOCKDEP_SMALL is also
enabled.
