scsi: cxlflash: Support SQ Command Mode

The SISLite specification outlines a new queuing model to improve
over the MMIO-based IOARRIN model that exists today. This new model
uses a submission queue that exists in host memory and is shared with
the device. Each entry in the queue is an IOARCB that describes a
transfer request. When requests are submitted, IOARCBs ('current'
position tracked in host software) are populated and the submission
queue tail pointer is then updated via MMIO to make the device aware
of the requests.
