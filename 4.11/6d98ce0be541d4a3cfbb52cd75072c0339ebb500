powerpc/64s: Fix idle wakeup potential to clobber registers

We concluded there may be a window where the idle wakeup code could get
to pnv_wakeup_tb_loss() (which clobbers non-volatile GPRs), but the
hardware may set SRR1[46:47] to 01b (no state loss) which would result
in the wakeup code failing to restore non-volatile GPRs.

I was not able to trigger this condition with trivial tests on real
hardware or simulator, but the ISA (at least 2.07) seems to allow for
it, and Gautham says that it can happen if there is an exception pending
when the sleep/winkle instruction is executed.
