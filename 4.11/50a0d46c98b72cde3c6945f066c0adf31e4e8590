s390/zcrypt: make ap_bus explicitly non-modular

The Makefile in drivers/s390 has:

	obj-y += cio/ block/ char/ crypto/ net/ scsi/ virtio/

  and the Makefile in crypto/ has:

	ap-objs := ap_bus.o ap_card.o ap_queue.o

  meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

Also note that MODULE_ALIAS is a no-op for non-module builds.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.

We replace module.h with moduleparam.h since the file does declare
some module parameters even though it is not modular itself.
