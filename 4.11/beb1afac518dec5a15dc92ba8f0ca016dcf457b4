net: ipv6: Add support to dump multipath routes via RTA_MULTIPATH attribute

IPv6 returns multipath routes as a series of individual routes making
their display and handling by userspace different and more complicated
than IPv4, putting the burden on the user to see that a route is part of
a multipath route and internally creating a multipath route if desired
(e.g., libnl does this as of commit 29b71371e764). This patch addresses
this difference, allowing multipath routes to be returned using the
RTA_MULTIPATH attribute.

The end result is that IPv6 multipath routes can be treated and displayed
in a format similar to IPv4:

    $ ip -6 ro ls vrf red
    2001:db8:1::/120 dev eth1 proto kernel metric 256  pref medium
    2001:db8:2::/120 dev eth2 proto kernel metric 256  pref medium
    2001:db8:200::/120 metric 1024
	    nexthop via 2001:db8:1::2  dev eth1 weight 1
	    nexthop via 2001:db8:2::2  dev eth2 weight 1
