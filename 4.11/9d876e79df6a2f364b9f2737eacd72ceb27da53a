bpf: fix unlocking of jited image when module ronx not set

Eric and Willem reported that they recently saw random crashes when
JIT was in use and bisected this to 74451e66d516 ("bpf: make jited
programs visible in traces"). Issue was that the consolidation part
added bpf_jit_binary_unlock_ro() that would unlock previously made
read-only memory back to read-write. However, DEBUG_SET_MODULE_RONX
cannot be used for this to test for presence of set_memory_*()
functions. We need to use ARCH_HAS_SET_MEMORY instead to fix this;
also add the corresponding bpf_jit_binary_lock_ro() to filter.h.
