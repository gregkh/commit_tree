PCI: rockchip: Fix rockchip_pcie_probe() error path to free resource list

rockchip_pcie_probe() calls of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources() to parse
resources from DT and build a resource list.  The caller is responsible for
disposing of the resource list.  This is normally done by
pci_release_host_bridge_dev() when the host bridge is removed.

If the host bridge probe fails, dispose of the resource list in the probe
error path.
