x86/apic: Fix a warning message in logical CPU IDs allocation

The current warning message in allocate_logical_cpuid() is somewhat confusing:

  Only 1 processors supported.Processor 2/0x2 and the rest are ignored.

As it might imply that there's only one CPU in the system - while what we ran
into here is a kernel limitation.

Fix the warning message to clarify all that:

  APIC: NR_CPUS/possible_cpus limit of 2 reached. Processor 2/0x2 and the rest are ignored.

( Also update the error return from -1 to -EINVAL, which is the more
  canonical return value. )
