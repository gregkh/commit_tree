bnxt_en: Handle no aggregation ring gracefully.

The current code assumes that we will always have at least 2 rx rings, 1
will be used as an aggregation ring for TPA and jumbo page placements.
However, it is possible, especially on a VF, that there is only 1 rx
ring available.  In this scenario, the current code will fail to initialize.
To handle it, we need to properly set up only 1 ring without aggregation.
Set a new flag BNXT_FLAG_NO_AGG_RINGS for this condition and add logic to
set up the chip to place RX data linearly into a single buffer per packet.
