regulator: Fix regulator_summary for deviceless consumers

It is allowed to call regulator_get with a NULL dev argument
(_regulator_get explicitly checks for it) but this causes an error later
when printing /sys/kernel/debug/regulator_summary.

Fix this by explicitly handling "deviceless" consumers in the debugfs code.
