apparmor: change aad apparmor_audit_data macro to a fn macro

The aad macro can replace aad strings when it is not intended to. Switch
to a fn macro so it is only applied when intended.

Also at the same time cleanup audit_data initialization by putting
common boiler plate behind a macro, and dropping the gfp_t parameter
which will become useless.
