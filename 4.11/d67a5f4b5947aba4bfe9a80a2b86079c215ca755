dm: flush queued bios when process blocks to avoid deadlock

Commit df2cb6daa4 ("block: Avoid deadlocks with bio allocation by
stacking drivers") created a workqueue for every bio set and code
in bio_alloc_bioset() that tries to resolve some low-memory deadlocks
by redirecting bios queued on current->bio_list to the workqueue if the
system is low on memory.  However other deadlocks (see below **) may
happen, without any low memory condition, because generic_make_request
is queuing bios to current->bio_list (rather than submitting them).

** the related dm-snapshot deadlock is detailed here:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2016-July/msg00065.html

Fix this deadlock by redirecting any bios on current->bio_list to the
bio_set's rescue workqueue on every schedule() call.  Consequently,
when the process blocks on a mutex, the bios queued on
current->bio_list are dispatched to independent workqueus and they can
complete without waiting for the mutex to be available.

The structure blk_plug contains an entry cb_list and this list can contain
arbitrary callback functions that are called when the process blocks.
To implement this fix DM (ab)uses the onstack plug's cb_list interface
to get its flush_current_bio_list() called at schedule() time.

This fixes the snapshot deadlock - if the map method blocks,
flush_current_bio_list() will be called and it redirects bios waiting
on current->bio_list to appropriate workqueues.
