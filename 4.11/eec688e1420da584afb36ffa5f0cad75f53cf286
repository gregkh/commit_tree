drm/i915: Add i915 perf infrastructure

Adds base i915 perf infrastructure for Gen performance metrics.

This adds a DRM_IOCTL_I915_PERF_OPEN ioctl that takes an array of uint64
properties to configure a stream of metrics and returns a new fd usable
with standard VFS system calls including read() to read typed and sized
records; ioctl() to enable or disable capture and poll() to wait for
data.

A stream is opened something like:

  uint64_t properties[] = {
      /* Single context sampling */
      DRM_I915_PERF_PROP_CTX_HANDLE,        ctx_handle,

      /* Include OA reports in samples */
      DRM_I915_PERF_PROP_SAMPLE_OA,         true,

      /* OA unit configuration */
      DRM_I915_PERF_PROP_OA_METRICS_SET,    metrics_set_id,
      DRM_I915_PERF_PROP_OA_FORMAT,         report_format,
      DRM_I915_PERF_PROP_OA_EXPONENT,       period_exponent,
   };
   struct drm_i915_perf_open_param parm = {
      .flags = I915_PERF_FLAG_FD_CLOEXEC |
               I915_PERF_FLAG_FD_NONBLOCK |
               I915_PERF_FLAG_DISABLED,
      .properties_ptr = (uint64_t)properties,
      .num_properties = sizeof(properties) / 16,
   };
   int fd = drmIoctl(drm_fd, DRM_IOCTL_I915_PERF_OPEN, &param);

Records read all start with a common { type, size } header with
DRM_I915_PERF_RECORD_SAMPLE being of most interest. Sample records
contain an extensible number of fields and it's the
DRM_I915_PERF_PROP_SAMPLE_xyz properties given when opening that
determine what's included in every sample.

No specific streams are supported yet so any attempt to open a stream
will return an error.

v2:
    use i915_gem_context_get() - Chris Wilson
v3:
    update read() interface to avoid passing state struct - Chris Wilson
    fix some rebase fallout, with i915-perf init/deinit
v4:
    s/DRM_IORW/DRM_IOW/ - Emil Velikov
