drm/nouveau/drm/nouveau/led: prevent a possible use-after-free

If the led class registration fails, we free drm->led but do not reset
it to NULL, which means that the suspend/resume/fini function will act
as if everything went well in init() and will likely crash the kernel.

This patch adds the missing drm->led = NULL.
