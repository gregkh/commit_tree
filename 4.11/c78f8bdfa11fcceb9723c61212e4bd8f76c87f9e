bpf: mark all registered map/prog types as __ro_after_init

All map types and prog types are registered to the BPF core through
bpf_register_map_type() and bpf_register_prog_type() during init and
remain unchanged thereafter. As by design we don't (and never will)
have any pluggable code that can register to that at any later point
in time, lets mark all the existing bpf_{map,prog}_type_list objects
in the tree as __ro_after_init, so they can be moved to read-only
section from then onwards.
