KVM: MIPS: Remove duplicated ASIDs from vcpu

The kvm_vcpu_arch structure contains both mm_structs for allocating MMU
contexts (primarily the ASID) but it also copies the resulting ASIDs
into guest_{user,kernel}_asid[] arrays which are referenced from uasm
generated code.

This duplication doesn't seem to serve any purpose, and it gets in the
way of generalising the ASID handling across guest kernel/user modes, so
lets just extract the ASID straight out of the mm_struct on demand, and
in fact there are convenient cpu_context() and cpu_asid() macros for
doing so.

To reduce the verbosity of this code we do also add kern_mm and user_mm
local variables where the kernel and user mm_structs are used.
