spi: acpi: Initialize modalias from of_compatible

When using devicetree spi_device.modalias is set to the compatible
string with the vendor prefix removed. For SPI devices described via
ACPI the spi_device.modalias string is initialized by acpi_device_hid.
When using ACPI and DT ids this string ends up something like "PRP0001".

Change acpi_register_spi_device to use the of_compatible property if
present. This makes it easier to instantiate spi drivers through ACPI
with DT ids.
