thp: fix MADV_DONTNEED vs. MADV_FREE race

Both MADV_DONTNEED and MADV_FREE handled with down_read(mmap_sem).

It's critical to not clear pmd intermittently while handling MADV_FREE
to avoid race with MADV_DONTNEED:

	CPU0:				CPU1:
				madvise_free_huge_pmd()
				 pmdp_huge_get_and_clear_full()
madvise_dontneed()
 zap_pmd_range()
  pmd_trans_huge(*pmd) == 0 (without ptl)
  // skip the pmd
				 set_pmd_at();
				 // pmd is re-established

It results in MADV_DONTNEED skipping the pmd, leaving it not cleared.
It violates MADV_DONTNEED interface and can result is userspace
misbehaviour.

Basically it's the same race as with numa balancing in
change_huge_pmd(), but a bit simpler to mitigate: we don't need to
preserve dirty/young flags here due to MADV_FREE functionality.
