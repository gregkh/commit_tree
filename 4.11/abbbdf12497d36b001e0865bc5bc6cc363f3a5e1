nbd: replace kill_bdev() with __invalidate_device()

When a filesystem is mounted on a nbd device and on a disconnect, because
of kill_bdev(), and resetting bdev size to zero, buffer_head mappings are
getting destroyed under mounted filesystem.

After a bdev size reset(i.e bdev->bd_inode->i_size = 0) on a disconnect,
followed by a sys_umount(),
        generic_shutdown_super()->...
        ->__sync_blockdev()->...
        -blkdev_writepages()->...
        ->do_invalidatepage()->...
        -discard_buffer()   is discarding superblock buffer_head assumed
to be in mapped state by ext4_commit_super().
