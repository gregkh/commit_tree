btmrvl: avoid double-disable_irq() race

It's much the same as what we did for mwifiex in:
b9da4d2 mwifiex: avoid double-disable_irq() race

"We have a race where the wakeup IRQ might be in flight while we're
calling mwifiex_disable_wake() from resume(). This can leave us
disabling the IRQ twice.

Let's disable the IRQ and enable it in case if we have double-disabled
it."
