HID: corsair: Add driver Scimitar Pro RGB gaming mouse 1b1c:1b3e support to hid-corsair

This mouse sold by Corsair as Scimitar PRO RGB defines two consecutive
Logical Minimum items in its Application (Consumer.0001) report making
it non parseable. This patch fixes the report descriptor overriding
byte 77 in rdesc from 0x16 (Logical Minimum with 16 bits value) to 0x26
(Logical Maximum with 16 bits value).
