Input: tsc2004/5 - switch to using generic device properties

Instead of supporting legacy platform data (of which we have no mainline
users) and OF-based properties, let's switch to generic device properties.
This will still allow legacy boards to use the driver (by defining property
sets and attaching them to the drivers) and will simplify probe and make
driver usable on ACPI-based systems as well.
