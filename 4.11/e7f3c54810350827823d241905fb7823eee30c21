[media] coda: use VDOA for un-tiling custom macroblock format

If the CODA driver is configured to produce NV12 output and the VDOA is
available, the VDOA can be used to transform the custom macroblock tiled
format to a raster-ordered format for scanout.

In this case, set the output format of the CODA to the custom macroblock
tiled format, disable the rotator, and use the VDOA to write to the v4l2
buffer. The VDOA is synchronized with the CODA to always un-tile the
frame that the CODA finished in the previous run.
