xfs: remove unused struct declarations

After scratching my head looking for "xfs_busy_extent" I realized
it's not used; it's xfs_extent_busy, and the declaration for the
other name is bogus.  Remove that and a few others as well.

(struct xfs_log_callback is used, but the 2nd declaration is
unnecessary).
