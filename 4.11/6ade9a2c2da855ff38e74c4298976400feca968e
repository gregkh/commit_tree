mmc: sh_mobile_sdhi: improve prerequisite for hw_reset

We need a SCC unit for hw_reset. Those units can only be described in
of_data. So, of_data and a valid SCC offset are prerequisites for
enabling the hw_reset capability. Merge the two 'if' conditions into one
and add a check for an scc offset.
