powerpc/pseries: Implement indexed-count hotplug memory remove

Indexed-count remove for memory hotplug guarantees that a contiguous block
of <count> lmbs beginning at a specified <index> will be unassigned (NOT
that <count> lmbs will be removed). Because of Qemu's per-DIMM memory
management, the removal of a contiguous block of memory currently
requires a series of individual calls. Indexed-count remove reduces
this series into a single call.
