net-timestamp: avoid use-after-free in ip_recv_error

Syzkaller reported a use-after-free in ip_recv_error at line

    info->ipi_ifindex = skb->dev->ifindex;

This function is called on dequeue from the error queue, at which
point the device pointer may no longer be valid.

Save ifindex on enqueue in __skb_complete_tx_timestamp, when the
pointer is valid or NULL. Store it in temporary storage skb->cb.

It is safe to reference skb->dev here, as called from device drivers
or dev_queue_xmit. The exception is when called from tcp_ack_tstamp;
in that case it is NULL and ifindex is set to 0 (invalid).

Do not return a pktinfo cmsg if ifindex is 0. This maintains the
current behavior of not returning a cmsg if skb->dev was NULL.

On dequeue, the ipv4 path will cast from sock_exterr_skb to
in_pktinfo. Both have ifindex as their first element, so no explicit
conversion is needed. This is by design, introduced in commit
0b922b7a829c ("net: original ingress device index in PKTINFO"). For
ipv6 ip6_datagram_support_cmsg converts to in6_pktinfo.

Fixes: 829ae9d61165 ("net-timestamp: allow reading recv cmsg on errqueue with origin tstamp")
