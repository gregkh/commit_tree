mei: me: generate an interrupt if the hw indicates reset.

In rare case the driver may lose connection with the device after device
reset due to a missed interrupt. The driver will unlock the flow by
generating an interrupt towards the firmware (HIG) when the device is in
the resetting state. The FW is able to ignore the interrupt during
orderly flow. The effected platforms are skylake and newer.
