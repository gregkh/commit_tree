ASoC: mpc5200_psc_ac97: Remove unused DAI ID defines

The DAI ID defines are back from the time when DAIs were referenced by a
numerical ID. These days a string is used instead and the defines are
unused. The last user of these defines was removed in commit f0fba2ad1b6b
("ASoC: multi-component - ASoC Multi-Component Support"). So remove the
defines as well.

This also means the mpc5200_psc_ac97.h file no longer has any content and
can be removed.
