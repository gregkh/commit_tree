powerpc/64: Avoid panic during boot due to divide by zero in init_cache_info()

I see a panic in early boot when building with a recent gcc toolchain.
The issue is a divide by zero, which is undefined. Older toolchains
let us get away with it:

int foo(int a) { return a / 0; }

foo:
	li 9,0
	divw 3,3,9
	extsw 3,3
	blr

But newer ones catch it:

foo:
	trap

Add a check to avoid the divide by zero.
