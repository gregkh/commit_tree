s390/zcrypt: Enable request count reset for cards and queues.

This patch introduces the possibility to reset the
request_count attribute for cards and queues to zero.
This can be used to set a clear state on the counters before
running an application and try out if and which hardware is
actually used. If the request_count counter of a card is
reset, for all associated queues the request_count is also
zeroed. If just a queue request_count is reset the card
counter is not updated however.
