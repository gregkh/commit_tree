ARM: dts: rename MSM8660/APQ8060 pmicintc to pm8058

The name "pmicintc" is ambiguous: there is a second power
management IC named PM8901 on these systems, and it is also
an interrupt controller. To make things clear, just name the
node alias "pm8058", this in unambigous and has all information
we need.
