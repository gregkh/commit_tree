scsi: ncr5380: Reduce #include files

The NCR5380 wrapper drivers don't export symbols or declarations and
don't actually need separate header files. Most of these header files
were removed already; only sun3_scsi.h and g_NCR5380.h remain.

Move the remaining definitions to the corresponding .c files to improve
readability and proximity. The #defines which influence the #included
core driver are no longer mixed up with unrelated #defines and #includes.
