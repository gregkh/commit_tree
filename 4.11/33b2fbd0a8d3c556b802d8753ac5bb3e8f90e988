qed: Reflect PF link when initializing VF

VF learns of the current link state via its bulletin board,
which might reflect either the physical link state or some
user-configured logical state.
Whenever the physical link changes or whnever such a configuration
is explicitly made by user the PF driver would update the bulletin
that the VF reads. But if neither has happened - i.e., PF still
hasn't got a physical link up and no additional configuration was
done the VF wouldn't have a valid link information available.

Simply reflect the physical link state whenever the VF is
initialized. The user could then affect it however he wants.
