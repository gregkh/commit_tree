drm/i915: Stop using RP_DOWN_EI on Baytrail

On Baytrail, we manually calculate busyness over the evaluation interval
to avoid issues with miscaluations with RC6 enabled. However, it turns
out that the DOWN_EI interrupt generator is completely bust - it
operates in two modes, continuous or never. Neither of which are
conducive to good behaviour. Stop unmask the DOWN_EI interrupt and just
compute everything from the UP_EI which does seem to correspond to the
desired interval.

v2: Fixup gen6_rps_pm_mask() as well
v3: Inline vlv_c0_above() to combine the now identical elapsed
calculation for up/down and simplify the threshold testing
