net/mlx4_core: Device revision support

The device revision field returned by the NodeInfo MAD is incorrect
on ConnectX3 devices.

This patch is driver side handling to complete a FW fix added at 2.11.1172.
INIT_HCA - bit at offset 0x0C.12 is set to 1 so that FW will report
correct device revision.

Older FW versions won't be affected from turning on that bit,
no capability bit is needed.
