proc,security: move restriction on writing /proc/pid/attr nodes to proc

Processes can only alter their own security attributes via
/proc/pid/attr nodes.  This is presently enforced by each individual
security module and is also imposed by the Linux credentials
implementation, which only allows a task to alter its own credentials.
Move the check enforcing this restriction from the individual
security modules to proc_pid_attr_write() before calling the security hook,
and drop the unnecessary task argument to the security hook since it can
only ever be the current task.
