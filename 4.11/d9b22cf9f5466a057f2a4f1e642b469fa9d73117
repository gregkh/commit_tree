ext4: fix stripe-unaligned allocations

When a filesystem is created using:

	mkfs.ext4 -b 4096 -E stride=512 <dev>

and we try to allocate 64MB extent, we will end up directly in
ext4_mb_complex_scan_group(). This is because the request is detected
as power-of-two allocation (so we start in ext4_mb_regular_allocator()
with ac_criteria == 0) however the check before
ext4_mb_simple_scan_group() refuses the direct buddy scan because the
allocation request is too large. Since cr == 0, the check whether we
should use ext4_mb_scan_aligned() fails as well and we fall back to
ext4_mb_complex_scan_group().

Fix the problem by checking for upper limit on power-of-two requests
directly when detecting them.
