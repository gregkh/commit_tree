mfd: Add STM32 Timers driver

This hardware block could at used at same time for PWM generation
and IIO timers.
PWM and IIO timer configuration are mixed in the same registers
so we need a multi fonction driver to be able to share those registers.

version 7:
- rebase on v4.10-rc2

version 6:
- rename files to stm32-timers
- rename functions to stm32_timers_xxx

version 5:
- fix Lee comments about detect function
- add missing dependency on REGMAP_MMIO

version 4:
- add a function to detect Auto Reload Register (ARR) size
- rename the structure shared with other drivers

version 2:
- rename driver "stm32-gptimer" to be align with SoC documentation
- only keep one compatible
- use of_platform_populate() instead of devm_mfd_add_devices()
