tracing: Show number of constants profiled in likely profiler

Now that constants are traced, it is useful to see the number of constants
that are traced in the likely/unlikely profiler in order to know if they
should be ignored or not.

The likely/unlikely will display a number after the "correct" number if a
"constant" count exists.
