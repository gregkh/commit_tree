hwrng: geode - Revert managed API changes

After commit e9afc746299d ("hwrng: geode - Use linux/io.h instead of
asm/io.h") the geode-rng driver uses devres with pci_dev->dev to keep
track of resources, but does not actually register a PCI driver.  This
results in the following issues:

1.  The driver leaks memory because the driver does not attach to a
device.  The driver only uses the PCI device as a reference.   devm_*()
functions will release resources on driver detach, which the geode-rng
driver will never do.  As a result,

2.  The driver cannot be reloaded because there is always a use of the
ioport and region after the first load of the driver.

Revert the changes made by  e9afc746299d ("hwrng: geode - Use linux/io.h
instead of asm/io.h").
