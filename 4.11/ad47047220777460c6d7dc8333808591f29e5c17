dm raid: fix raid "check" regression due to improper cleanup in raid_message()

While cleaning up awkward branching in raid_message() a raid set "check"
regression was introduced because "check" needs both MD_RECOVERY_SYNC
and MD_RECOVERY_REQUESTED flags set.

Fix this regression by explicitly setting both flags for the "check"
case (like is also done for the "repair" case, but redundant set_bit()s
are perfectly fine because it adds clarity to what is needed in response
to both messages -- in addition this isn't fast path code).
