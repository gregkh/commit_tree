i40e: update comment explaining where FDIR buffers are freed

The original comment implies that the only location where the raw_packet
buffer will be freed is in i40e_clean_tx_ring() which is incorrect. In
fact this isn't even the normal case. Update the comment explaining
where the memory is freed.
