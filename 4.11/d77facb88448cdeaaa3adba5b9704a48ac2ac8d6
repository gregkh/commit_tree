brcmfmac: use local iftype avoiding use-after-free of virtual interface

A use-after-free was found using KASAN. In brcmf_p2p_del_if() the virtual
interface is removed using call to brcmf_remove_interface(). After that
the virtual interface instance has been freed and should not be referenced.
Solve this by storing the nl80211 iftype in local variable, which is used
in a couple of places anyway.
