tpm: Begin the process to deprecate user_read_timer

For a long time the cdev read/write interface had this strange
idea that userspace had to read the result within 60 seconds otherwise
it is discarded. Perhaps this made sense under some older locking regime,
but in the modern kernel it is not required and is just dangerous.

Since something may be relying on this, double the timeout and print a
warning. We can remove the code in a few years, but this should be
enough to prevent new users.
