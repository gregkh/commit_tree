kernel/ksysfs.c: add __ro_after_init to bin_attribute structure

The object notes_attr of type bin_attribute is not modified after
getting initailized by ksysfs_init.  Apart from initialization in
ksysfs_init it is also passed as an argument to the function
sysfs_create_bin_file but this argument is of type const.  Therefore,
add __ro_after_init to its declaration.
