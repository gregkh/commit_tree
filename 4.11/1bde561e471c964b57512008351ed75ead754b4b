checkpatch: add another old address for the FSF

We still have a lot of old addresses for the FSF in the kernel.

  willy@harry:~/kernel/idr$ git grep '675 Mass' |wc -l
  1502
  willy@harry:~/kernel/idr$ git grep '59 Temple' |wc -l
  2825
  willy@harry:~/kernel/idr$ git grep '51 Franklin' |wc -l
  2020

Let's discourage adding the oldest one too.
