ACPI / EC: Use busy polling mode when GPE is not enabled

When GPE is not enabled, it is not efficient to use the wait polling mode
as it introduces an unexpected scheduler delay.
So before the GPE handler is installed, this patch uses busy polling mode
for all EC(s) and the logic can be applied to non boot EC(s) during the
suspend/resume process.
