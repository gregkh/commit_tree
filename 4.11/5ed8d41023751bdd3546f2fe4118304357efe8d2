USB: serial: spcp8x5: fix modem-status handling

Make sure to detect short control transfers and return zero on success
when retrieving the modem status.

This fixes the TIOCMGET implementation which since e1ed212d8593 ("USB:
spcp8x5: add proper modem-status support") has returned TIOCM_LE on
successful retrieval, and avoids leaking bits from the stack on short
transfers.

This also fixes the carrier-detect implementation which since the above
mentioned commit unconditionally has returned true.
