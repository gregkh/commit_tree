xfs: only reclaim unwritten COW extents periodically

We only want to reclaim preallocations from our periodic work item.
Currently this is archived by looking for a dirty inode, but that check
is rather fragile.  Instead add a flag to xfs_reflink_cancel_cow_* so
that the caller can ask for just cancelling unwritten extents in the COW
fork.
