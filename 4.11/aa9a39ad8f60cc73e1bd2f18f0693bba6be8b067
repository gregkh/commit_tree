apparmor: convert change_profile to use fqname later to give better control

Moving the use of fqname to later allows learning profiles to be based
on the fqname request instead of just the hname. It also allows cleaning
up some of the name parsing and lookup by allowing the use of
the fqlookupn_profile() lib fn.
