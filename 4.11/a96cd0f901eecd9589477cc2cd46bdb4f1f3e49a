iio: accel: hid-sensor-accel-3d: Add timestamp

Added timestamp channel. With this change, each sample has a timestamp.
This timestamp can be from the sensor hub when present or local kernel
timestamp. HID sensors can send timestamp with input data using usage id
HID_USAGE_SENSOR_TIME_TIMESTAMP. This timestamp value is converted to
nano seconds before pushing this sample to the iio core.
