spi: pxa2xx: Prepare for edge-triggered interrupts

When using the a device with edge-triggered interrupts, such as MSIs,
the interrupt handler has to ensure that there is a point in time during
its execution where all interrupts sources are silent so that a new
event can trigger a new interrupt again.

This is achieved here by disabling all interrupt sources for a moment
before processing them according to the status register. If a new
interrupt should have arrived after we read the status, it will now
re-trigger the interrupt, even in edge mode.
