crypto: tcrypt - Add debug prints

tcrypt is very tight-lipped when it succeeds, but a bit more feedback
would be useful when developing or debugging crypto drivers, especially
since even a successful run ends with the module failing to insert. Add
a couple of debug prints, which can be enabled with dynamic debug:

Before:

 # insmod tcrypt.ko mode=10
 insmod: can't insert 'tcrypt.ko': Resource temporarily unavailable

After:

 # insmod tcrypt.ko mode=10 dyndbg
 tcrypt: testing ecb(aes)
 tcrypt: testing cbc(aes)
 tcrypt: testing lrw(aes)
 tcrypt: testing xts(aes)
 tcrypt: testing ctr(aes)
 tcrypt: testing rfc3686(ctr(aes))
 tcrypt: all tests passed
 insmod: can't insert 'tcrypt.ko': Resource temporarily unavailable
