drm/tegra: Stop using drm_framebuffer_unregister_private

This is the deprecated function for when you embedded the framebuffer
somewhere else (which breaks refcounting). But Tegra is using
drm_framebuffer_remove and a free-standing FB, so this is redundant.

One caveat here is that the failure path in the init code still
manually cleaned up the fb. I presume that was an oversight and
changed it over to drm_framebuffer_remove too.
