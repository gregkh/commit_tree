crypto: arm64/aes - avoid literals for cross-module symbol references

Using simple adrp/add pairs to refer to the AES lookup tables exposed by
the generic AES driver (which could be loaded far away from this driver
when KASLR is in effect) was unreliable at module load time before commit
41c066f2c4d4 ("arm64: assembler: make adr_l work in modules under KASLR"),
which is why the AES code used literals instead.

So now we can get rid of the literals, and switch to the adr_l macro.
