sctp: sctp_transport_dst_check should check if transport pmtu is dst mtu

Now when sending a packet, sctp_transport_dst_check will check if dst
is obsolete by calling ipv4/ip6_dst_check. But they return obsolete
only when adding a new cache, after that when the cache's pmtu is
updated again, it will not trigger transport->dst/pmtu's update.

It can be reproduced by reducing route's pmtu twice. At the 1st time
client will add a new cache, and transport->pathmtu gets updated as
sctp_transport_dst_check finds it's obsolete. But at the 2nd time,
cache's mtu is updated, sctp client will never send out any packet,
because transport->pmtu has no chance to update.

This patch is to fix this by also checking if transport pmtu is dst
mtu in sctp_transport_dst_check, so that transport->pmtu can be
updated on time.
