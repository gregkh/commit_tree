staging: greybus: log: Fix line over 80 characters.

Fix coding style issue caught by checkpatch.pl related to the following
warning:
	- CHECK: WARNING: line over 80 characters
This is done by dropping a redundant cast and by replacing the format specifier
in dev_err(); to "%zu" instead of "%d", in order to silence the warnings of the
compiler.

Also, while at it, drop the redundant cast in the comparison as well to maintain
consistency.
