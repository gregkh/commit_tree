net: dsa: b53: Implement software reset for 58xx devices

Implement the correct software reset sequence for 58xx devices by
setting all 3 reset bits and polling for the SW_RST bit to clear itself
without a given timeout. We cannot use is58xx() here because that would
also include the 7445/7278 Starfighter 2 which have their own driver
doing the reset earlier on due to the HW specific integration.
