sctp: add stream reconf primitive

This patch is to add a primitive based on sctp primitive frame for
sending stream reconf request. It works as the other primitives,
and create a SCTP_CMD_REPLY command to send the request chunk out.

sctp_primitive_RECONF would be the api to send a reconf request
chunk.
