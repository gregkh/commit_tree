crush: remove mutable part of CRUSH map

Then add it to the working state. It would be very nice if we didn't
have to take a lock to calculate a crush placement. By moving the
permutation array into the working data, we can treat the CRUSH map as
immutable.

Reflects ceph.git commit cbcd039651c0569551cb90d26ce27e1432671f2a.
