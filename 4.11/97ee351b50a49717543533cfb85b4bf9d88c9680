powerpc/boot: Fix zImage TOC alignment

Recent toolchains force the TOC to be 256 byte aligned. We need to
enforce this alignment in the zImage linker script, otherwise pointers
to our TOC variables (__toc_start) could be incorrect. If the actual
start of the TOC and __toc_start don't have the same value we crash
early in the zImage wrapper.
