ASoC: soc-core: remove OF adjusting for snd_soc_of_parse_audio_simple_widgets

Because prototype of OF-graph sound card support didn't have Sound Card
node, commit 1ef5bcd57be5c8b31286b7b47828064be25f266b
("ASoC: soc-core: adjust for graph on snd_soc_of_parse_audio_simple_widgets")
adjusted to it on each functions.

But final discussion result of ALSA SoC / OF-graph ML, OF-graph sound
card has node. Thus, this commit became no longer needed.

This reverts commit 1ef5bcd57be5c8b31286b7b47828064be25f266b.
