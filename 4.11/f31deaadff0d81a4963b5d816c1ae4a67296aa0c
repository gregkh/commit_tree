arm64: cpufeature: Don't enforce system-wide SPE capability

The statistical profiling extension (SPE) is an optional feature of
ARMv8.1 and is unlikely to be supported by all of the CPUs in a
heterogeneous system.

This patch updates the cpufeature checks so that such systems are not
tainted as unsupported.
