ovl: drop CAP_SYS_RESOURCE from saved mounter's credentials

If overlay was mounted by root then quota set for upper layer does not work
because overlay now always use mounter's credentials for operations.
Also overlay might deplete reserved space and inodes in ext4.

This patch drops capability SYS_RESOURCE from saved credentials.
This affects creation new files, whiteouts, and copy-up operations.
