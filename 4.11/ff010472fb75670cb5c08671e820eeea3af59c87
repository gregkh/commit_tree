cpufreq: Restore policy min/max limits on CPU online

On CPU online the cpufreq core restores the previous governor (or
the previous "policy" setting for ->setpolicy drivers), but it does
not restore the min/max limits at the same time, which is confusing,
inconsistent and real pain for users who set the limits and then
suspend/resume the system (using full suspend), in which case the
limits are reset on all CPUs except for the boot one.

Fix this by making cpufreq_online() restore the limits when an inactive
policy is brought online.

The commit log and patch are inspired from Rafael's earlier work.
