Input: serio - drop unnecessary calls to device_init_wakeup

Calling device_init_wakeup in the remove function is unnecessary since the
device is going away, and thus won't be able to cause any wakeups under any
circumstances. Besides, the driver cleanup code already handles the
necessary cleanup.

Similarly, disabling wakeup in the probe error path is unnecessary, as is
disabling wakeup in the probe function in the first place.
