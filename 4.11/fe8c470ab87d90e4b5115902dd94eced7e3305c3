ACPI / power: Avoid maybe-uninitialized warning

gcc -O2 cannot always prove that the loop in acpi_power_get_inferred_state()
is enterered at least once, so it assumes that cur_state might not get
initialized:

drivers/acpi/power.c: In function 'acpi_power_get_inferred_state':
drivers/acpi/power.c:222:9: error: 'cur_state' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This sets the variable to zero at the start of the loop, to ensure that
there is well-defined behavior even for an empty list. This gets rid of
the warning.

The warning first showed up when the -Os flag got removed in a bug fix
patch in linux-4.11-rc5.

I would suggest merging this addon patch on top of that bug fix to avoid
introducing a new warning in the stable kernels.
