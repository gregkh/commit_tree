mtd: spi-nor: add a stateless method to support memory size above 128Mib

This patch provides an alternative mean to support memory above 16MiB
(128Mib) by replacing 3byte address op codes by their associated 4byte
address versions.

Using the dedicated 4byte address op codes doesn't change the internal
state of the SPI NOR memory as opposed to using other means such as
updating a Base Address Register (BAR) and sending command to enter/leave
the 4byte mode.

Hence when a CPU reset occurs, early bootloaders don't need to be aware
of BAR value or 4byte mode being enabled: they can still access the first
16MiB of the SPI NOR memory using the regular 3byte address op codes.
