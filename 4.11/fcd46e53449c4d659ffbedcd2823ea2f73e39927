drm/i915: Declare i915_gem_object_create_internal() as taking phys_addr_t size

The internal object is a collection of struct pages and so is
intrinsically linked to the available physical memory on the machine,
and not an arbitrary type from the uabi. Use phys_addr_t so the link
between size and memory consumption is clear, and then double check that
we don't overflow the maximum object size.

v2: Also assert that size is not zero - a mistake I made a few times
while writing selftests.
