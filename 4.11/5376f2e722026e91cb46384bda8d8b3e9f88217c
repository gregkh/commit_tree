drivers/tty: Compute 'current' directly

This patch effectively replaces the tsk pointer dereference
(which is obviously == current), to directly use get_current()
macro. This is to make the removal of setting foreign task
states smoother and painfully obvious. Performance win on some
archs such as x86-64 and ppc64 -- arm64 is no longer an issue.
