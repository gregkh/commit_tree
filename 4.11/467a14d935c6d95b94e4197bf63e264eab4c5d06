drm/i915: Protect DSPARB registers with a spinlock

Each DSPARB register can house bits for two separate pipes, hence
we must protect the registers during reprogramming so that parallel
FIFO reconfigurations happening simultaneosly on multiple pipes won't
corrupt each others values.

We'll use a new spinlock for this instead of the wm_mutex since we'll
have to move the DSPARB programming to happen from the vblank evade
critical section, and we can't use mutexes in there.

v2: Document why we use a spinlock instead of a mutex (Maarten)
