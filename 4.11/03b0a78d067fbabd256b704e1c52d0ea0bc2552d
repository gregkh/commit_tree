staging: bcm2835-v4l2: Apply many whitespace fixes from checkpatch.

Generated with checkpatch.pl --fix-inplace, some manual fixes for
cases where checkpatch fixed one out of multiple lines of mis-indented
function parameters, and then git add -p out of the results.

I skipped some fixes that should probably instead be replaced with the
BIT() macro.
