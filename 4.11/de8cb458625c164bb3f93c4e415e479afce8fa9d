efi: Get and store the secure boot status

Get the firmware's secure-boot status in the kernel boot wrapper and stash
it somewhere that the main kernel image can find.

The efi_get_secureboot() function is extracted from the ARM stub and (a)
generalised so that it can be called from x86 and (b) made to use
efi_call_runtime() so that it can be run in mixed-mode.

For x86, it is stored in boot_params and can be overridden by the boot
loader or kexec.  This allows secure-boot mode to be passed on to a new
kernel.
