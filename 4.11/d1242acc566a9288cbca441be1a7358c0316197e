iio: light: cm3605: mark PM functions as __maybe_unused

When CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is disabled, we get a harmless warning

drivers/iio/light/cm3605.c:292:12: error: 'cm3605_pm_resume' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]
drivers/iio/light/cm3605.c:281:12: error: 'cm3605_pm_suspend' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]

Marking the functions as possibly unused avoids the warning without
needing to add an #ifdef.
