z3fold: use per-page spinlock

Most of z3fold operations are in-page, such as modifying z3fold page
header or moving z3fold objects within a page.  Taking per-pool spinlock
to protect per-page objects is therefore suboptimal, and the idea of
having a per-page spinlock (or rwlock) has been around for some time.

This patch implements spinlock-based per-page locking mechanism which is
lightweight enough to normally fit ok into the z3fold header.
