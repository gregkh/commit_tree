IB/mlx5: Add port counter support for Receive WQs

Counters weren't updated due to Receive WQs' traffic since the
counter-id was not associated with the RQ.

Added support for associating the q-counter-id with the Receive WQ.
The attachment is done only when changing WQ's state from RESET to
READY in modify-WQ command.

FW support is required for the above, without this support
Receive WQ counters will not count.
