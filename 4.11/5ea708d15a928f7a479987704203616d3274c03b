block: simplify blk_init_allocated_queue

Return an errno value instead of the passed in queue so that the callers
don't have to keep track of two queues, and move the assignment of the
request_fn and lock to the caller as passing them as argument doesn't
simplify anything.  While we're at it also remove two pointless NULL
assignments, given that the request structure is zeroed on allocation.
