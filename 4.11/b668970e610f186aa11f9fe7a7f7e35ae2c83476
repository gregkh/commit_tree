MIPS: Fix modversions

kernelci.org reports tons of build warnings for linux-next:

35	WARNING: "memcpy" [fs/fat/msdos.ko] has no CRC!
35	WARNING: "__copy_user" [fs/fat/fat.ko] has no CRC!
32	WARNING: EXPORT symbol "memset" [vmlinux] version generation failed, symbol will not be versioned.
32	WARNING: EXPORT symbol "copy_page" [vmlinux] version generation failed, symbol will not be versioned.
32	WARNING: EXPORT symbol "clear_page" [vmlinux] version generation failed, symbol will not be versioned.
32	WARNING: EXPORT symbol "__strncpy_from_user_nocheck_asm" [vmlinux] version generation failed, symbol will not be versioned.

The problem here is mainly the missing asm/asm-prototypes.h header file
that is supposed to include the prototypes for each symbol that is exported
from an assembler file.

A second problem is that the asm/uaccess.h header contains some but not
all the necessary declarations for the user access helpers.

Finally, the vdso build is broken once we add asm/asm-prototypes.h, so
we have to fix this at the same time by changing the vdso header. My
approach here is to just not look for exported symbols in the VDSO
assembler files, as the symbols cannot be exported anyway.
