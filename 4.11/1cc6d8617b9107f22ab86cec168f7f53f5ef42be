usb: xhci: remove unnecessary second abort try

The second try was a workaround for (what we thought was) command
ring failing to stop in the first place. But this turns out to be
due to the race that we have fixed(see "xhci: Fix race related to
abort operation"). With that fix, it is time to remove the second
try.
