ARM: dts: am335x-baltos: disable EEE for Atheros 8035 PHY

Though cpsw doesn't support EEE feature, Atheros 8035 provides
automatic EEE support that is enabled by default. This causes
occasional link drops when link partner also announces EEE support.
These link drops occur on both 100Mbit/s and 1000Mbit/s speeds.
So disable EEE advertising completely.
