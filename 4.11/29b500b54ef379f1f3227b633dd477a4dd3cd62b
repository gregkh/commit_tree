KVM: MIPS: Support NetLogic KScratch registers

tlbex.c uses the implementation dependent $22 CP0 register group on
NetLogic cores, with the help of the c0_kscratch() helper. Allow these
registers to be allocated by the KVM entry code too instead of assuming
KScratch registers are all $31, which will also allow pgd_reg to be
handled since it is allocated that way.

We also drop the masking of kscratch_mask with 0xfc, as it is redundant
for the standard KScratch registers (Config4.KScrExist won't have the
low 2 bits set anyway), and apparently not necessary for NetLogic.
