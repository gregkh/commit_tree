USB: iowarrior: fix NULL-deref at probe

Make sure to check for the required interrupt-in endpoint to avoid
dereferencing a NULL-pointer should a malicious device lack such an
endpoint.

Note that a fairly recent change purported to fix this issue, but added
an insufficient test on the number of endpoints only, a test which can
now be removed.
