autofs: take more care to not update last_used on path walk

GUI environments seem to be becoming more agressive at scanning
filesystems, to the point where autofs cannot expire mounts at all.

This is one key reason the update of the autofs dentry info last_used
field is done in the expire system when the dentry is seen to be in use.

But somewhere along the way instances of the update has crept back into
the autofs path walk functions which, with the more aggressive file
access patterns, is preventing expiration.

Changing the update in the path walk functions allows autofs to at least
make progress in spite of frequent immediate re-mounts from file
accesses.
