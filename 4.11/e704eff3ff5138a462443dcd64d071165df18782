ftrace: Have set_graph_function handle multiple functions in one write

Currently, only one function can be written to set_graph_function and
set_graph_notrace. The last function in the list will have saved, even
though other functions will be added then removed.

Change the behavior to be the same as set_ftrace_function as to allow
multiple functions to be written. If any one fails, none of them will be
added. The addition of the functions are done at the end when the file is
closed.
