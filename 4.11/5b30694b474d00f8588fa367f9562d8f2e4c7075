drm/i915: Align GGTT sizes to a fence tile row

Ensure the view occupies the full tile row so that reads/writes into the
VMA do not escape (via fenced detiling) into neighbouring objects - we
will pad the object with scratch pages to satisfy the fence. This
applies the lazy-tiling we employed on gen2/3 to gen4+.
