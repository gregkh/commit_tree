rcu: Only dump stalled-tasks stacks if there was a real stall

The print_other_cpu_stall() function currently unconditionally invokes
rcu_print_detail_task_stall().  This is OK because if there was a stall
sufficient to cause print_other_cpu_stall() to be invoked, that stall
is very likely to persist through the entire print_other_cpu_stall()
execution.  However, if the stall did not persist, the variable ndetected
will be zero, and that variable is already tested in an "if" statement.
Therefore, this commit moves the call to rcu_print_detail_task_stall()
under that pre-existing "if" to improve readability, with a very rare
reduction in overhead.
