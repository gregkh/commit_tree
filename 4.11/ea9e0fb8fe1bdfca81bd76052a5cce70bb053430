locking/ww_mutex: Set use_ww_ctx even when locking without a context

We will add a new field to struct mutex_waiter.  This field must be
initialized for all waiters if any waiter uses the ww_use_ctx path.

So there is a trade-off: Keep ww_mutex locking without a context on
the faster non-use_ww_ctx path, at the cost of adding the
initialization to all mutex locks (including non-ww_mutexes), or avoid
the additional cost for non-ww_mutex locks, at the cost of adding
additional checks to the use_ww_ctx path.

We take the latter choice.  It may be worth eliminating the users of
ww_mutex_lock(lock, NULL), but there are a lot of them.
