ixgbe: Make use of order 1 pages and 3K buffers independent of FCoE

In order to support build_skb with jumbo frames it will be necessary to use
3K buffers for the Rx path with 8K pages backing them.  This is needed on
architectures that implement 4K pages because we can't support 2K buffers
plus padding in a 4K page.

In the case of systems that support page sizes larger than 4K the 3K
attribute will only be applied to FCoE as we can fall back to using just 2K
buffers and adding the padding.
