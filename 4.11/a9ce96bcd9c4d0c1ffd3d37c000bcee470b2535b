ASoC: hdac_hdmi: Handle MST pin jack detection at boot/resume

The ELD notification can be received asynchronously from the graphics
side and this may happen just at the moment the sound driver is
initializing and notification will be missed. Similarly at system
resume, the notification is ignored as the  ELD and connection states
are updated in anyway at the end of the resume.
So check the jack status in boot/resume by querying the port presence
based on pin caps and report the jack status.
