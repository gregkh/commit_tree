mfd: ab8500-sysctrl: Handle probe deferral

In the current boot, clients making use of the AB8500 sysctrl
may be probed before the ab8500-sysctrl driver. This gives them
-EINVAL, but should rather give -EPROBE_DEFER.

Before this, the abx500 clock driver didn't probe properly,
and as a result the codec driver in turn using the clocks did
not probe properly. After this patch, everything probes
properly.

Also add OF compatible-string probing. This driver is all
device tree, so let's just make a drive-by-fix of that as
well.
