arch: Rename CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA and CONFIG_DEBUG_MODULE_RONX

Both of these options are poorly named. The features they provide are
necessary for system security and should not be considered debug only.
Change the names to CONFIG_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX and
CONFIG_STRICT_MODULE_RWX to better describe what these options do.
