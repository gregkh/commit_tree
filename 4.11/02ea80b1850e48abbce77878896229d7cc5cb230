bpf: add various verifier test cases for self-tests

Add a couple of test cases, for example, probing for xadd on a spilled
pointer to packet and map_value_adj register, various other map_value_adj
tests including the unaligned load/store, and trying out pointer arithmetic
on map_value_adj register itself. For the unaligned load/store, we need
to figure out whether the architecture has efficient unaligned access and
need to mark affected tests accordingly.
