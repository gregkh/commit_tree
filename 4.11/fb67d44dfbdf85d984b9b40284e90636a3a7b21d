scsi: cxlflash: Cleanup prints

The usage of prints within the cxlflash driver is inconsistent. This
hinders debug and makes the driver source and log output appear sloppy.

The following cleanups help unify the prints within cxlflash:
 - move all prints to dev-* where possible
 - transition all hex prints to lowercase
 - standardize variable prints in debug output
 - derive pointers in a consistent manner
 - change int to bool where appropriate
 - remove superfluous data from prints and print statements that do not
   make sense
