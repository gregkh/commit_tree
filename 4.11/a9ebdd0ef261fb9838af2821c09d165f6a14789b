ALSA: x86: Don't pass SNDRV_PCM_INFO_BATCH flag

The PCM engine on LPE audio isn't like a batch-style process any
longer, but rather it deals with the standard ring buffer.  Remove the
BATCH info flag so that PA can handle the buffer in timer-sched mode.

Similarly, the DOUBLE flag is also superfluous.  Drop both bits.
