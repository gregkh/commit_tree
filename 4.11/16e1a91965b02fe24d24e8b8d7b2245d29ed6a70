sctp: implement receiver-side procedures for the Incoming SSN Reset Request Parameter

This patch is to implement Receiver-Side Procedures for the Incoming
SSN Reset Request Parameter described in rfc6525 section 5.2.3.

It's also to move str_list endian conversion out of sctp_make_strreset_req,
so that sctp_make_strreset_req can be used more conveniently to process
inreq.
