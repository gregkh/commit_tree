dm-rq: don't dereference request payload after ending request

Bart reported a case where dm would crash with use-after-free
poison. This is due to dm_softirq_done() accessing memory
associated with a request after calling end_request on it.
This is most visible on !blk-mq, since we free the memory
immediately for that case.
