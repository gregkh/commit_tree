mlxsw: spectrum: Change max vfid

A user that wants many bridges will use 1.Q bridge which are scalable.
One can have as many 1.Q bridges as vfids.
This patch sets their number to 1k, which is a reasonably large number.
This change is done here because the next patches will add a new flood
table, and without it, it will increase the overall size of the flood
tables dramatically.
