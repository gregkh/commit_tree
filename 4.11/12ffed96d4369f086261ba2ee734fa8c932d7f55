drm/fb-helper: Allow var->x/yres(_virtual) < fb->width/height again

Otherwise this can also prevent modesets e.g. for switching VTs, when
multiple monitors with different native resolutions are connected.

The depths must match though, so keep the != test for that.

Also update the DRM_DEBUG output to be slightly more accurate, this
doesn't only affect requests from userspace.
