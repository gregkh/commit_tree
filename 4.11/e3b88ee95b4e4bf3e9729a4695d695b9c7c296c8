target: Fix handling of aborted failed commands

If a target driver (e.g. tcm_qla2xxx) calls
transport_generic_request_failure() to report that receiving data
has failed and that SCSI command has already been aborted by the
initiator, ensure that the SCSI status ABORTED is sent back to the
initiator instead of the sense code provided by the target driver.
