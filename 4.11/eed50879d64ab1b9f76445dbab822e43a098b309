xprtrdma: Squelch kbuild sparse complaint

New complaint from kbuild for 4.9.y:

net/sunrpc/xprtrdma/verbs.c:489:19: sparse: incompatible types in
    comparison expression (different type sizes)

verbs.c:
489	max_sge = min(ia->ri_device->attrs.max_sge, RPCRDMA_MAX_SEND_SGES);

I can't reproduce this running sparse here. Likewise, "make W=1
net/sunrpc/xprtrdma/verbs.o" never indicated any issue.

A little poking suggests that because the range of its values is
small, gcc can make the actual width of RPCRDMA_MAX_SEND_SGES
smaller than the width of an unsigned integer.
