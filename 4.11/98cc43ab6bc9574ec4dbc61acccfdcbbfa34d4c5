s390/cio: clarify cssid usage

Currently the cssid in various structures is used as the id of
the respective channel subsystem. Sometimes however we call the
index in the channel_subsystems array cssid. In some places the
id is even used as the index.

Provide a new define MAX_CSS_IDX and use it where appropriate.
In addition to that provide a dummy function to find a channel
subsystem by its id and a macro to iterate over the channel
subsystems.
