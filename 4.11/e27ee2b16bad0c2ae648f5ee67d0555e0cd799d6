Bluetooth: btqcomsmd: Allow driver to build if COMPILE_TEST is enabled

The driver only has runtime but no build time dependency with QCOM_SMD &&
QCOM_WCNSS_CTRL. So it can be built for testing purposes if COMPILE_TEST
option is enabled.

This is useful to have more build coverage and make sure that the driver
is not affected by changes that could cause build regressions.
