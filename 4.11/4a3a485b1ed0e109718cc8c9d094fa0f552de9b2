writeback: fix memory leak in wb_queue_work()

When WB_registered flag is not set, wb_queue_work() skips queuing the
work, but does not perform the necessary clean up. In particular, if
work->auto_free is true, it should free the memory.

The leak condition can be reprouced by following these steps:

   mount /dev/sdb /mnt/sdb
   /* In qemu console: device_del sdb */
   umount /dev/sdb

Above will result in a wb_queue_work() call on an unregistered wb and
thus leak memory.
