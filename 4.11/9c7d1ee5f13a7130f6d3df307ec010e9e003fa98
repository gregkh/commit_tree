scsi: cxlflash: Refactor context reset to share reset logic

As staging for supporting hardware with different context reset
registers but a similar reset procedure, refactor the existing context
reset routine to move the reset logic to a common routine. This will
allow hardware with a different reset register to leverage existing
code.
