rcu: Make rcu_cpu_starting() use its "cpu" argument

The rcu_cpu_starting() function uses this_cpu_ptr() to locate the
incoming CPU's rcu_data structure.  This works for the boot CPU and for
all CPUs onlined after rcu_init() executes (during very early boot).
Currently, this is the full set of CPUs, so all is well.  But if
anyone ever parallelizes boot before rcu_init() time, it will fail.
This commit therefore substitutes the rcu_cpu_starting() function's
this_cpu_pointer() for per_cpu_ptr(), future-proofing the code and
(arguably) improving readability.

This commit inadvertently fixes a latent bug: If there ever had been
more than just the boot CPU online at rcu_init() time, the old code
would not initialize the non-boot CPUs, but rather would repeatedly
initialize the boot CPU.
