m32r: fix build warning

Some m32r builds were having a warning:

  arch/m32r/include/asm/cmpxchg.h:191:3: warning: value computed is not used
  arch/m32r/include/asm/cmpxchg.h:68:3: warning: value computed is not used

Taking the idea from commit e001bbae7147 ("ARM: cmpxchg: avoid warnings
from macro-ized cmpxchg() implementations") the m32r implementation is
changed to use a similar construct with a compound expression instead of
a typecast, which causes the compiler to not complain about an unused
result.
