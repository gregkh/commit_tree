drm/cma-helper: simplify setup for drivers with ->dirty callbacks

If we store the fb funcs pointer, we can remove a bit of boilerplate.
Also remove the _fbdev_ in the example code, since the fb_funcs->dirty
callback has nothing to do with fbdev. It's a KMS feature, only
used by the fbdev deferred_io support to implement flushing/upload.
