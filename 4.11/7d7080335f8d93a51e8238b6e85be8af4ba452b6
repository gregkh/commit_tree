scsi: lpfc: Finalize Kconfig options for nvme

Reviewing the result of what was just added for Kconfig, we made a poor
choice. It worked well for full kernel builds, but not so much for how
it would be deployed on a distro.

Here's the final result:
- lpfc will compile in NVME initiator and/or NVME target support based
  on whether the kernel has the corresponding subsystem support.
  Kconfig is not used to drive this specifically for lpfc.
- There is a module parameter, lpfc_enable_fc4_type, that indicates
  whether the ports will do FCP-only or FCP & NVME (NVME-only not yet
  possible due to dependency on fc transport). As FCP & NVME divvys up
  exchange resources, and given NVME will not be often initially, the
  default is changed to FCP only.
