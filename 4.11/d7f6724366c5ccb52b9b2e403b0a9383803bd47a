scripts/spelling.txt: add some typo-words

I wrote a simple script to find new typo not in spelling.txt.
(https://github.com/jinb-park/find-linux-kernel-typo)

and get following result:

	[ rank ]
	63 paramaters
	18 alignement
	9 strucuture
	....

The number means how many files include the typo.
This patch adds these common typo.
