sched/headers: Prepare for new header dependencies before moving code to <linux/sched/nmi.h>

We are going to move softlockup APIs out of <linux/sched.h>, which
will have to be picked up from other headers and a couple of .c files.

<linux/nmi.h> already includes <linux/sched.h>.

Include the <linux/nmi.h> header in the files that are going to need it.
