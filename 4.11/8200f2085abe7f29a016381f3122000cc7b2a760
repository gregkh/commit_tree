vmbus: use rcu for per-cpu channel list

The per-cpu channel list is now referred to in the interrupt
routine. This is mostly safe since the host will not normally generate
an interrupt when channel is being deleted but if it did then there
would be a use after free problem.

To solve, this use RCU protection on ther per-cpu list.
