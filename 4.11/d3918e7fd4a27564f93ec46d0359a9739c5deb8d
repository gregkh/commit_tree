KVM: PPC: Book3S: Change interrupt call to reduce scratch space use on HV

Change the calling convention to put the trap number together with
CR in two halves of r12, which frees up HSTATE_SCRATCH2 in the HV
handler.

The 64-bit PR handler entry translates the calling convention back
to match the previous call convention (i.e., shared with 32-bit), for
simplicity.
