arm64: dts: exynos: Remove unneeded unit names in Exynos5433 nodes

The "samsung,exynos5433-mipi-video-phy" and "samsung,exynos5250-dwusb3"
DT bindings don't specify a reg property for these nodes, so having a
unit name leads to the following DTC warnings:

Node /soc/video-phy@105c0710 has a unit name, but no reg property
Node /soc/usb@15400000 has a unit name, but no reg property
Node /soc/usb@15a00000 has a unit name, but no reg property
