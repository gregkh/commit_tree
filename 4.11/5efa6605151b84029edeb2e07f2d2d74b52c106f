KVM: PPC: Book 3S: XICS cleanup: remove XICS_RM_REJECT

Commit b0221556dbd3 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Move virtual mode ICP functions
 to real-mode") removed the setting of the XICS_RM_REJECT flag. And
since that commit, nothing else sets the flag any more, so we can remove
the flag and the remaining code that handles it, including the counter
that counts how many times it get set.
