ppdev: fix registering same device name

Usually every parallel port will have a single pardev registered with
it. But ppdev driver is an exception. This userspace parallel port
driver allows to create multiple parrallel port devices for a single
parallel port. And as a result we were having a big warning like:
"sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/parport0/ppdev0.0'".
And with that many parallel port printers stopped working.

We have been using the minor number as the id field while registering
a parralel port device with a parralel port. But when there are
multiple parrallel port device for one single parallel port, they all
tried to register with the same name like 'pardev0.0' and everything
started failing.
Use an incremented index as the id instead of the minor number.
