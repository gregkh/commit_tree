extcon: int3496: Set the id pin to direction-input if necessary

With the new more strict ACPI gpio code the dsdt's IoRestriction
flags are honored on gpiod_get, but in some dsdt's it is wrong,
so explicitly call gpiod_direction_input on the id gpio if
necessary.

This fixes the following errors when the int3496 code is used
together with the new more strict ACPI gpio code:

[ 2382.484415] gpio gpiochip1: (INT33FF:01): gpiochip_lock_as_irq: tried to flag a GPIO set as output for IRQ
[ 2382.484425] gpio gpiochip1: (INT33FF:01): unable to lock HW IRQ 3 for IRQ
[ 2382.484429] genirq: Failed to request resources for INT3496:00 (irq 174) on irqchip chv-gpio
[ 2382.484518] intel-int3496 INT3496:00: can't request IRQ for USB ID GPIO: -22
[ 2382.500359] intel-int3496: probe of INT3496:00 failed with error -22
