scsi_dh_emc: switch to scsi_execute_req_flags()

Switch to scsi_execute_req_flags() and scsi_get_vpd_page() instead of
open-coding it.  Using scsi_execute_req_flags() will set REQ_QUIET and
REQ_PREEMPT, but this is okay as we're evaluating the errors anyway and
should be able to send the command even if the device is quiesced.
