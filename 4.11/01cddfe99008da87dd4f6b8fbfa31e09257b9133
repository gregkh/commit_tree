mm,fs,dax: mark dax_iomap_pmd_fault as const

The two alternative implementations of dax_iomap_fault have different
prototypes, and one of them is obviously wrong as seen from this build
warning:

  fs/dax.c: In function 'dax_iomap_fault':
  fs/dax.c:1462:35: error: passing argument 2 of 'dax_iomap_pmd_fault' discards 'const' qualifier from pointer target type [-Werror=discarded-qualifiers]

This marks the argument 'const' as in all the related functions.

Fixes: a2d581675d48 ("mm,fs,dax: change ->pmd_fault to ->huge_fault")
