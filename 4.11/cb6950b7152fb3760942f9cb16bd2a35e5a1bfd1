arm64: kprobes: remove kprobe_exceptions_notify

Commit fc62d0207ae0 ("kprobes: Introduce weak variant of
kprobe_exceptions_notify()") introduces a generic empty version of the
function for architectures that don't need special handling, like arm64.
As such, remove the arch/arm64/ specific handler.
