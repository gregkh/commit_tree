iio: health: max30100: use msleep() for long uncritical delays

ulseep_range() uses hrtimers and provides no advantage over msleep()
for larger delays. Fix up the 35ms delays here to use msleep() and
reduce the load on the hrtimer subsystem.

Fixes: commit 4d33615df58b ("iio: light: add MAX30100 oximeter driver support")
