regulator: core: simplify _regulator_get()

The code in _regulator_get() got a bit confusing over time, with control
flow jumping to a label from couple of places. Let's untangle it a bit by
doing the following:

1. Make handling of missing supplies and substituting them with dummy
regulators more explicit:

- check if we not have full constraints and refuse considering dummy
  regulators with appropriate message;

- use "switch (get_type)" to handle different types of request explicitly
  as well. "Normal" requests will get dummies, exclusive will not and
  will notify user about that; optional will fail silently.

2. Stop jumping to a label in the middle of the function but instead have
proper conditional flow. I believe jumps should be reserved for error
handling, breaking from inner loop, or restarting a loop, but not for
implementing normal conditional flow.
