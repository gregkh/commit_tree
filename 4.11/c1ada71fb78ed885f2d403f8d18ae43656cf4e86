mmc: slot-gpio: Don't override con_id when request descriptor

The caller may supply connection ID, index, or both. All combinations are
possible and mmc framework should not make any assumption on what exactly
caller wants.

Remove con_id override conditionals in mmc_gpiod_request_ro() and
mmc_gpiod_request_cd().
