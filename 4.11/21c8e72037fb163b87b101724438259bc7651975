crypto: testmgr - use calculated count for number of test vectors

When working on AES in CCM mode for ARM, my code passed the internal
tcrypt test before I had even bothered to implement the AES-192 and
AES-256 code paths, which is strange because the tcrypt does contain
AES-192 and AES-256 test vectors for CCM.

As it turned out, the define AES_CCM_ENC_TEST_VECTORS was out of sync
with the actual number of test vectors, causing only the AES-128 ones
to be executed.

So get rid of the defines, and wrap the test vector references in a
macro that calculates the number of vectors automatically.

The following test vector counts were out of sync with the respective
defines:

    BF_CTR_ENC_TEST_VECTORS          2 ->  3
    BF_CTR_DEC_TEST_VECTORS          2 ->  3
    TF_CTR_ENC_TEST_VECTORS          2 ->  3
    TF_CTR_DEC_TEST_VECTORS          2 ->  3
    SERPENT_CTR_ENC_TEST_VECTORS     2 ->  3
    SERPENT_CTR_DEC_TEST_VECTORS     2 ->  3
    AES_CCM_ENC_TEST_VECTORS         8 -> 14
    AES_CCM_DEC_TEST_VECTORS         7 -> 17
    AES_CCM_4309_ENC_TEST_VECTORS    7 -> 23
    AES_CCM_4309_DEC_TEST_VECTORS   10 -> 23
    CAMELLIA_CTR_ENC_TEST_VECTORS    2 ->  3
    CAMELLIA_CTR_DEC_TEST_VECTORS    2 ->  3
