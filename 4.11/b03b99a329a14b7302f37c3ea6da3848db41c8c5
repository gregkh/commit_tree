acpi, nfit, libnvdimm: fix interleave set cookie calculation (64-bit comparison)

While reviewing the -stable patch for commit 86ef58a4e35e "nfit,
libnvdimm: fix interleave set cookie calculation" Ben noted:

    "This is returning an int, thus it's effectively doing a 32-bit
     comparison and not the 64-bit comparison you say is needed."

Update the compare operation to be immune to this integer demotion problem.
