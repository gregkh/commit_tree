checkpatch: warn when formats use %Z and suggest %z

vsnprintf extension %Z<foo> is non-standard C.  Suggest the use of %z
instead.

Miscellanea:

 - Correct the misuse of type string PRINTF_0xDECIMAL type strings are
   supposed to be uppercase only. Fix this and add tr/[a-z]/[A-Z] to the
   type check in case I forget this again sometime in the future.

 - Improve the mechanism to find these defects so all 3 current checks
   are done on the format string
