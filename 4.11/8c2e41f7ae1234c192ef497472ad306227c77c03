x86/kvm/vmx: Simplify segment_base()

Use actual pointer types for pointers (instead of unsigned long) and
replace hardcoded constants with the appropriate self-documenting
macros.

The function is still a bit messy, but this seems a lot better than
before to me.

This is mostly borrowed from a patch by Thomas Garnier.
