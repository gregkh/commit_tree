bdi: Fix use-after-free in wb_congested_put()

bdi_writeback_congested structures get created for each blkcg and bdi
regardless whether bdi is registered or not. When they are created in
unregistered bdi and the request queue (and thus bdi) is then destroyed
while blkg still holds reference to bdi_writeback_congested structure,
this structure will be referencing freed bdi and last wb_congested_put()
will try to remove the structure from already freed bdi.

With commit 165a5e22fafb "block: Move bdi_unregister() to
del_gendisk()", SCSI started to destroy bdis without calling
bdi_unregister() first (previously it was calling bdi_unregister() even
for unregistered bdis) and thus the code detaching
bdi_writeback_congested in cgwb_bdi_destroy() was not triggered and we
started hitting this use-after-free bug. It is enough to boot a KVM
instance with virtio-scsi device to trigger this behavior.

Fix the problem by detaching bdi_writeback_congested structures in
bdi_exit() instead of bdi_unregister(). This is also more logical as
they can get attached to bdi regardless whether it ever got registered
or not.
