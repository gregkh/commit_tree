Input: xpad - restore LED state after device resume

Set the LED_CORE_SUSPENDRESUME flag on our LED device so the
LED state will be automatically restored by LED core on resume.

Since Xbox One pads stop flashing only when reinitialized, we'll
send them the initialization packet so they calm down too.
