ARM: 8665/1: nommu: access ID_PFR1 only if CPUID scheme

Greg upon trying to boot no-MMU Kernel on ARM926EJ reported boot
failure. He root caused it to ID_PFR1 access introduced by the
commit mentioned in the fixes tag below.

All CP15 processors need not have processor feature registers, only
for architectures defined by CPUID scheme would have it. Hence check
for it before accessing processor feature register, ID_PFR1.
