drm/i915: Don't sanitize has_decoupled_mmio if platform is not broxton

The check in __intel_uncore_early_sanitize() to disable decoupled mmio
would disable it for every platform that is not broxton. While that's
not a problem now since only broxton supports that, simply setting
.has_decoupled_mmio in a new platform's device info wouldn't suffice. So
avoid future confusion and change the workaround to only change the
value of has_decoupled_mmio for broxton.

v2: git add compile fix. (Ander)
