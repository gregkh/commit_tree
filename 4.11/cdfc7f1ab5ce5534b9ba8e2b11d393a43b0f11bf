torture: Add tests without slow grace period setup/cleanup

This commit moves CONFIG_RCU_TORTURE_TEST_SLOW_CLEANUP,
CONFIG_RCU_TORTURE_TEST_SLOW_INIT, and CONFIG_RCU_TORTURE_TEST_SLOW_PREINIT
from CFcommon to all of the TREE scenarios other than TREE08 and TREE09
in order to do at least some testing without these Kconfig options set.
