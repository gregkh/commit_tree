clk: renesas: mstp: ensure register writes complete

When there is no status bit, it is possible for the clock enable/disable
operation to have not completed by the time the driver code resumes
execution. This is due to the fact that write operations are sometimes
queued and delayed internally. Doing a read ensures the write operations
has completed.
