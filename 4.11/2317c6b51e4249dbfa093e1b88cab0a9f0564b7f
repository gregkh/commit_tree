openvswitch: Set event bit after initializing labels.

Connlabels are included in conntrack netlink event messages only if
the IPCT_LABEL bit is set in the event cache (see
ctnetlink_conntrack_event()).  Set it after initializing labels for a
new connection.

Found upon further system testing, where it was noticed that labels
were missing from the conntrack events.
