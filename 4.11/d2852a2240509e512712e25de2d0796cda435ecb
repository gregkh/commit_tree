arch: add ARCH_HAS_SET_MEMORY config

Currently, there's no good way to test for the presence of
set_memory_ro/rw/x/nx() helpers implemented by archs such as
x86, arm, arm64 and s390.

There's DEBUG_SET_MODULE_RONX and DEBUG_RODATA, however both
don't really reflect that: set_memory_*() are also available
even when DEBUG_SET_MODULE_RONX is turned off, and DEBUG_RODATA
is set by parisc, but doesn't implement above functions. Thus,
add ARCH_HAS_SET_MEMORY that is selected by mentioned archs,
where generic code can test against this.

This also allows later on to move DEBUG_SET_MODULE_RONX out of
the arch specific Kconfig to define it only once depending on
ARCH_HAS_SET_MEMORY.
