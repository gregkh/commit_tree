PCI: dwc: Fix crashes seen due to missing assignments

Fix the following crash, seen in dwc/pci-imx6.

  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000070
  pgd = c0004000
  [00000070] *pgd=00000000
  Internal error: Oops: 805 [#1] SMP ARM
  Modules linked in:
  CPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 4.10.0-09686-g9e31489 #1
  Hardware name: Freescale i.MX6 Quad/DualLite (Device Tree)
  task: cb850000 task.stack: cb84e000
  PC is at imx6_pcie_probe+0x2f4/0x414
  ...

While at it, fix the same problem in various drivers instead of waiting for
individual crash reports.

The change in the imx6 driver was tested with qemu. The changes in other
drivers are based on code inspection and have been compile tested only.
