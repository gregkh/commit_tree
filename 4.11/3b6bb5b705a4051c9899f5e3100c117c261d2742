iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Restrict IOMMU Domain Geometry to 32-bit address space

Currently, the IPMMU/VMSA driver supports 32-bit I/O Virtual Addresses
only, and thus sets io_pgtable_cfg.ias = 32.  However, it doesn't force
a 32-bit IOVA space through the IOMMU Domain Geometry.

Hence if a device (e.g. SYS-DMAC) rightfully configures a 40-bit DMA
mask, it will still be handed out a 40-bit IOVA, outside the 32-bit IOVA
space, leading to out-of-bounds accesses of the PGD when mapping the
IOVA.

Force a 32-bit IOMMU Domain Geometry to fix this.
