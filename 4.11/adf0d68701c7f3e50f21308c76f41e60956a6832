ceph: fix unsafe dcache access in ceph_encode_dentry_release

Accessing d_parent requires some sort of locking or it could vanish
out from under us. Since we take the d_lock anyway, use that to fetch
d_parent and take a reference to it, and then use that reference to
call ceph_encode_inode_release.
