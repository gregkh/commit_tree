drm/i915: Remove useless casts to intel_plane_state

The visible member used to be in intel_plane_state->visible,
but has been moved to drm_plane_state->visible. In the conversion
some casts were left in that are now useless.

to_intel_plane_state(x)->base.visible is the same as x->visible,
so use the latter to clear up the code a little.
