xen: clean up xenbus internal headers

The xenbus driver has an awful mixture of internally and globally
visible headers: some of the internally used only stuff is defined in
the global header include/xen/xenbus.h while some stuff defined in
internal headers is used by other drivers, too.

Clean this up by moving the externally used symbols to
include/xen/xenbus.h and the symbols used internally only to a new
header drivers/xen/xenbus/xenbus.h replacing xenbus_comms.h and
xenbus_probe.h
