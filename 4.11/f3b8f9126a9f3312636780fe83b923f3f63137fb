drm/i915/execlists: Reorder execlists register enabling

Empirically we restart following a GPU reset more successfully if we call
lrc_init_hws() (which contains a posting read) last. (The failure mode
that was observed was that breadcrumb writes into the HWS from the
recovered requests went astray leading to the context-switch maintaining
forward progress, but the requests not being retired/completed.)

For clarity, lrc_init_hws() is inlined (and the unused function then
removed).
