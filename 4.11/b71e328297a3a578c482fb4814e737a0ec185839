vmbus: add direct isr callback mode

Change the simple boolean batched_reading into a tri-value.
For future NAPI support in netvsc driver, the callback needs to
occur directly in interrupt handler.

Batched mode is also changed to disable host interrupts immediately
in interrupt routine (to avoid unnecessary host signals), and the
tasklet is rescheduled if more data is detected.
