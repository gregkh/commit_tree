scsi: qedi: return via va_end to match corresponding va_start

Although on most systems va_end is a no-op, it is good practice to use
va_end on the function return path, especially since the va_start
documenation states:

  "Each invocation of va_start() must be matched by a corresponding
   invocation of va_end() in the same function."
