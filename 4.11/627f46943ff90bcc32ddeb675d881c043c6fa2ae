afs: Adjust mode bits processing

Mode bits for an afs file should not be enforced in the usual
way.

For files, the absence of user bits can restrict file access
with respect to what is granted by the server.

These bits apply regardless of the owner or the current uid; the
rest of the mode bits (group, other) are ignored.
