MIPS: Fix special case in 64 bit IP checksumming.

For certain arguments such as saddr = 0xc0a8fd60, daddr = 0xc0a8fda1,
len = 80, proto = 17, sum = 0x7eae049d there will be a carry when
folding the intermediate 64 bit checksum to 32 bit but the code doesn't
add the carry back to the one's complement sum, thus an incorrect result
will be generated.
