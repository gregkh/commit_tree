md: ensure md devices are freed before module is unloaded.

Commit: cbd199837750 ("md: Fix unfortunate interaction with evms")
change mddev_put() so that it would not destroy an md device while
->ctime was non-zero.

Unfortunately, we didn't make sure to clear ->ctime when unloading
the module, so it is possible for an md device to remain after
module unload.  An attempt to open such a device will trigger
an invalid memory reference in:
  get_gendisk -> kobj_lookup -> exact_lock -> get_disk

when tring to access disk->fops, which was in the module that has
been removed.

So ensure we clear ->ctime in md_exit(), and explain how that is useful,
as it isn't immediately obvious when looking at the code.
