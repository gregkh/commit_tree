HID: wacom: generic: Wacom mouse is only provided for opaque tablets

Commit f85c9dc ("Support tool ID and additional tool types") introduced mouse
and lens cursor tools to generic codepath, which covers both display (direct)
and opaque tablets (indirect devices). However, mouse and lens cursor tools are
only provided for opaque tablets. This patch ignores mouse and lens cursor tools
if the device is a display tablet.
