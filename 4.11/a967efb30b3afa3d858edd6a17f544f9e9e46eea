Btrfs: fix potential use-after-free for cloned bio

KASAN reports that there is a use-after-free case of bio in btrfs_map_bio.

If we need to submit IOs to several disks at a time, the original bio
would get cloned and mapped to the destination disk, but we really should
use the original bio instead of a cloned bio to do the sanity check
because cloned bios are likely to be freed by its endio.
