nvmet-rdma: Fix a possible uninitialized variable dereference

When handling a new recv command, we grab a new rsp resource and
check for the queue state being live. In case the queue is not in
live state, we simply restore the rsp back to the free list. However
in this flow we didn't set rsp->queue yet, so we cannot dereference it.

Instead, make sure to initialize rsp->queue (and other rsp members)
as soon as possible so we won't reference uninitialized variables.
