RDMA/bnxt_re: Add bnxt_re RoCE driver

This patch introduces the RoCE driver for the Broadcom
NetXtreme-E 10/25/40/50G RoCE HCAs.

The RoCE driver is a two part driver that relies on the parent
bnxt_en NIC driver to operate.  The changes needed in the bnxt_en
driver have already been incorporated via Dave Miller's net tree
into the mainline kernel.

The vendor official git repository for this driver is available
on github as:
