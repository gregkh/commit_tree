mm, vmscan: enhance mm_vmscan_lru_shrink_inactive tracepoint

mm_vmscan_lru_shrink_inactive will currently report the number of
scanned and reclaimed pages.  This doesn't give us an idea how the
reclaim went except for the overall effectiveness though.  Export and
show other counters which will tell us why we couldn't reclaim some
pages.

	- nr_dirty, nr_writeback, nr_congested and nr_immediate tells
	  us how many pages are blocked due to IO
	- nr_activate tells us how many pages were moved to the active
	  list
	- nr_ref_keep reports how many pages are kept on the LRU due
	  to references (mostly for the file pages which are about to
	  go for another round through the inactive list)
	- nr_unmap_fail - how many pages failed to unmap

All these are rather low level so they might change in future but the
tracepoint is already implementation specific so no tools should be
depending on its stability.
