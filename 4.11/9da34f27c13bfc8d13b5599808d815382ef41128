net: qcom/emac: display the phy driver info after we connect

The PHY driver is attached only when the driver calls
phy_connect_direct().  Calling phy_attached_print() to display
information about the PHY driver prior to that point is meaningless.
The interface can be brought down, a new PHY driver can be loaded,
and the interface then brought back up.  This is the correct time
to display information about the attached driver.

Since phy_attached_print() also prints information about the
interrupt, that needs to be set as well.
