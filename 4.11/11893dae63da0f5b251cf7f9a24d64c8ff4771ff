usb: chipidea: msm: Handle phy power states

The ULPI phy on qcom platforms needs to be initialized and
powered on after a USB reset and before we toggle the run/stop
bit. Otherwise, the phy locks up and doesn't work properly. Hook
the phy initialization into the RESET event and the phy power off
into the STOPPED event.
