x86/cpufeature: Enable RING3MWAIT for Knights Mill

Enable ring 3 MONITOR/MWAIT for Intel Xeon Phi codenamed Knights Mill. We
can't guarantee that this (KNM) will be the last CPU model that needs this
hack.  But, we do recognize that this is far from optimal, and there is an
effort to ensure we don't keep doing extending this hack forever.
