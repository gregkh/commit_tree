netfilter: merge ctinfo into nfct pointer storage area

After this change conntrack operations (lookup, creation, matching from
ruleset) only access one instead of two sk_buff cache lines.

This works for normal conntracks because those are allocated from a slab
that guarantees hw cacheline or 8byte alignment (whatever is larger)
so the 3 bits needed for ctinfo won't overlap with nf_conn addresses.

Template allocation now does manual address alignment (see previous change)
on arches that don't have sufficent kmalloc min alignment.

Some spots intentionally use skb->_nfct instead of skb_nfct() helpers,
this is to avoid undoing the skb_nfct() use when we remove untracked
conntrack object in the future.
