tcp: memset ca_priv data to 0 properly

Always zero out ca_priv data in tcp_assign_congestion_control() so that
ca_priv data is cleared out during socket creation.
Also always zero out ca_priv data in tcp_reinit_congestion_control() so
that when cc algorithm is changed, ca_priv data is cleared out as well.
We should still zero out ca_priv data even in TCP_CLOSE state because
user could call connect() on AF_UNSPEC to disconnect the socket and
leave it in TCP_CLOSE state and later call setsockopt() to switch cc
algorithm on this socket.
