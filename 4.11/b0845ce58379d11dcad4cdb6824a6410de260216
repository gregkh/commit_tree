kasan: report only the first error by default

Disable kasan after the first report.  There are several reasons for
this:

 - Single bug quite often has multiple invalid memory accesses causing
   storm in the dmesg.

 - Write OOB access might corrupt metadata so the next report will print
   bogus alloc/free stacktraces.

 - Reports after the first easily could be not bugs by itself but just
   side effects of the first one.

Given that multiple reports usually only do harm, it makes sense to
disable kasan after the first one.  If user wants to see all the
reports, the boot-time parameter kasan_multi_shot must be used.
