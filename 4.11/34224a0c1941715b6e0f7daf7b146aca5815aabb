ARM: dts: STiH407-pinctrl: Add Pinctrl group for HW flow-control

Each serial port which supports HW flow-control should have 2 Pinctrl
groups.  One for when HW flow-control is in progress, where the IP
will take over controlling the lines and another group which enables
the lines to be toggled using GPIO mechanisms.
