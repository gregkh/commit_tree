drm: omapdrm: Keep vblank interrupt enabled while CRTC is active

Instead of going through a complicated private IRQ registration
mechanism, handle the vblank interrupt activation with the standard
drm_crtc_vblank_get() and drm_crtc_vblank_put() mechanism. This will let
the DRM core keep the vblank interrupt enabled as long as needed to
update the frame counter.
