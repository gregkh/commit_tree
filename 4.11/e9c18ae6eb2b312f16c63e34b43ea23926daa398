Drivers: hv: util: move waiting for release to hv_utils_transport itself

Waiting for release_event in all three drivers introduced issues on release
as on_reset() hook is not always called. E.g. if the device was never
opened we will never get the completion.

Move the waiting code to hvutil_transport_destroy() and make sure it is
only called when the device is open. hvt->lock serialization should
guarantee the absence of races.
