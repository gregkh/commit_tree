inet: kill smallest_size and smallest_port

In inet_csk_get_port we seem to be using smallest_port to figure out where the
best place to look for a SO_REUSEPORT sk that matches with an existing set of
SO_REUSEPORT's.  However if we get to the logic

if (smallest_size != -1) {
	port = smallest_port;
	goto have_port;
}

we will do a useless search, because we would have already done the
inet_csk_bind_conflict for that port and it would have returned 1, otherwise we
would have gone to found_tb and succeeded.  Since this logic makes us do yet
another trip through inet_csk_bind_conflict for a port we know won't work just
delete this code and save us the time.
