slub: do not merge cache if slub_debug contains a never-merge flag

In case CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG_ON=n, find_mergeable() gets debug features from
commandline but never checks if there are features from the
SLAB_NEVER_MERGE set.

As a result selected by slub_debug caches are always mergeable if they
have been created without a custom constructor set or without one of the
SLAB_* debug features on.

This moves the SLAB_NEVER_MERGE check below the flags update from
commandline to make sure it won't merge the slab cache if one of the debug
features is on.
