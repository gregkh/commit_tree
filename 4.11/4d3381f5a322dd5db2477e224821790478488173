bpf: Add tests for the lpm trie map

The first part of this program runs randomized tests against the
lpm-bpf-map. It implements a "Trivial Longest Prefix Match" (tlpm)
based on simple, linear, single linked lists. The implementation
should be pretty straightforward.

Based on tlpm, this inserts randomized data into bpf-lpm-maps and
verifies the trie-based bpf-map implementation behaves the same way
as tlpm.

The second part uses 'real world' IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and tests
the trie with those.
