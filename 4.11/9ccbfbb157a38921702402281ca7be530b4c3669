perf/core: Do error out on a kernel filter on an exclude_filter event

It is currently possible to configure a kernel address filter for a
event that excludes kernel from its traces (attr.exclude_kernel==1).

While in reality this doesn't make sense, the SET_FILTER ioctl() should
return a error in such case, currently it does not. Furthermore, it
will still silently discard the filter and any potentially valid filters
that came with it.

This patch makes the SET_FILTER ioctl() error out in such cases.
