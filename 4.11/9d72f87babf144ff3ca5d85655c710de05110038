vfio/type1: Check MSI remapping at irq domain level

In case the IOMMU translates MSI transactions (typical case
on ARM), we check MSI remapping capability at IRQ domain
level. Otherwise it is checked at IOMMU level.

At this stage the arm-smmu-(v3) still advertise the
IOMMU_CAP_INTR_REMAP capability at IOMMU level. This will be
removed in subsequent patches.
