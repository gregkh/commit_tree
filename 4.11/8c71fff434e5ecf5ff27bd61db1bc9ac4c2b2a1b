[media] v4l: vsp1: Adapt vsp1_du_setup_lif() interface to use a structure

The interface to configure the LIF in the VSP1 requires adapting the
function prototype for any changes. This makes extending the interface
difficult.

Change the function prototype to pass a structure which can be easily
extended.

This changes the means of disabling the pipeline, by now passing a NULL
configuration rather than passing either a 0 width or height.

[Fixed kerneldoc, made vsp1_du_setup_lif() cfg argument const]
