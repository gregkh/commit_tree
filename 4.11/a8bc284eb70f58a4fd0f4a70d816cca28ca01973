kvm: nVMX: Refactor handle_vmptrld()

Handle_vmptrld is split into two parts: the part that handles the
VMPTRLD instruction, and the part that establishes the current VMCS
pointer.  The latter will be used when restoring the checkpointed state
of a vCPU that had a valid VMCS pointer when a snapshot was taken.
