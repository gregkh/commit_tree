efi/libstub: Skip GOP with PIXEL_BLT_ONLY format

The UEFI Specification permits Graphics Output Protocol (GOP) instances
without direct framebuffer access. This is indicated in the Mode structure
with a PixelFormat enumeration value of PIXEL_BLT_ONLY. Given that the
kernel does not know how to drive a Blt() only framebuffer (which is only
permitted before ExitBootServices() anyway), we should disregard such
framebuffers when looking for a GOP instance that is suitable for use as
the boot console.

So modify the EFI GOP initialization to not use a PIXEL_BLT_ONLY instance,
preventing attempts later in boot to use an invalid screen_info.lfb_base
address.

[ Moved the Blt() only check into the loop and clarified that Blt() only GOPs are unusable by the kernel. ]
