Input: at32psif - drop unnecessary error messages and other changes

Error messages after memory allocation failures are unnecessary and
can be dropped, given that they are emitted as dev_dbg() so nobody except
person actively debugging the driver would see them.

Also replace jump to return 'goto l; ... l: return e;' with 'return e;'
