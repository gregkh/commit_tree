Revert "net: qcom/emac: configure the external phy to allow pause frames"

This reverts commit 3e884493448131179a5b7cae1ddca1028ffaecc8.

With commit 529ed1275263 ("net: phy: phy drivers should not set
SUPPORTED_[Asym_]Pause"), phylib now handles automatically enabling
pause frame support in the PHY, and the MAC driver should follow suit.

Since the EMAC driver driver does this,  we no longer need to force
pause frames support.
