xhci: Set URB actual length for stopped control transfers

A control transfer that stopped at the status stage incorrectly
warned about a "unexpected TRB Type 4", and did not set the
transferred actual_length for the URB.

The URB actual_length for control transfers should contain the
bytes transferred in the data stage.

Bytes of a partially sent setup stage and missing bytes from
status stage should be left out.
