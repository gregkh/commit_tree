ipmi: bt-bmc: Use a regmap for register access

The registers for the bt-bmc device live under the Aspeed LPC
controller. Devicetree bindings have recently been introduced for the
LPC controller where the "host" portion of the LPC register space is
described as a syscon device. Future devicetrees describing the bt-bmc
device should nest its node under the appropriate "simple-mfd", "syscon"
compatible node.

This change allows the bt-bmc driver to function with both syscon and
non-syscon- based devicetree descriptions by always using a regmap for
register access, either retrieved from the parent syscon device or
instantiated if none exists.
