xen/x86: Remove PVH support

We are replacing existing PVH guests with new implementation.

We are keeping xen_pvh_domain() macro (for now set to zero) because
when we introduce new PVH implementation later in this series we will
reuse current PVH-specific code (xen_pvh_gnttab_setup()), and that
code is conditioned by 'if (xen_pvh_domain())'. (We will also need
a noop xen_pvh_domain() for !CONFIG_XEN_PVH).
