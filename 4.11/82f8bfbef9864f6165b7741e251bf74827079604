ARM: dts: r8a7790: Use R-Car Gen 2 fallback binding for i2c nodes

Use recently added R-Car Gen 2 fallback binding for i2c nodes in
DT for r8a7790 SoC.

This has no run-time effect for the current driver as the initialisation
sequence is the same for the SoC-specific binding for r8a7790 and the
fallback binding for R-Car Gen 2.
