bridge: fdb: converge fdb searching functions into one

Before this patch we had 3 different fdb searching functions which was
confusing. This patch reduces all of them to one - fdb_find_rcu(), and
two flavors: br_fdb_find() which requires hash_lock and br_fdb_find_rcu
which requires RCU. This makes it clear what needs to be used, we also
remove two abusers of __br_fdb_get which called it under hash_lock and
replace them with br_fdb_find().
