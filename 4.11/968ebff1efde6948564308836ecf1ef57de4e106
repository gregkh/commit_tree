cgroup, perf_event: make perf_event controller work on cgroup2 hierarchy

perf_event is a utility controller whose primary role is identifying
cgroup membership to filter perf events; however, because it also
tracks some per-css state, it can't be replaced by pure cgroup
membership test.  Mark the controller as implicitly enabled on the
default hierarchy so that perf events can always be filtered based on
cgroup v2 path as long as the controller is not mounted on a legacy
hierarchy.

"perf record" is updated accordingly so that it searches for both v1
and v2 hierarchies.  A v1 hierarchy is used if perf_event is mounted
on it; otherwise, it uses the v2 hierarchy.

v2: Doc updated to reflect more flexible rebinding behavior.
