MIPS: Add cacheinfo support

Add cacheinfo support for MIPS architectures.

Use information from the cpuinfo_mips struct to populate the
cacheinfo struct. This allows an architecture agnostic approach,
however this also means if cache information is not properly
populated within the cpuinfo_mips struct, there is nothing
we can do. (I.E. c-r3k.c)
