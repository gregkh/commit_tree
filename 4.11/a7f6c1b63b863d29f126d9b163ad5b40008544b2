AppArmor: Use GFP_KERNEL for __aa_kvmalloc().

Calling kmalloc(GFP_NOIO) with order == PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER is not
recommended because it might fall into infinite retry loop without
invoking the OOM killer.

Since aa_dfa_unpack() is the only caller of kvzalloc() and
aa_dfa_unpack() which is calling kvzalloc() via unpack_table() is
doing kzalloc(GFP_KERNEL), it is safe to use GFP_KERNEL from
__aa_kvmalloc().

Since aa_simple_write_to_buffer() is the only caller of kvmalloc()
and aa_simple_write_to_buffer() is calling copy_from_user() which
is GFP_KERNEL context (see memdup_user_nul()), it is safe to use
GFP_KERNEL from __aa_kvmalloc().

Therefore, replace GFP_NOIO with GFP_KERNEL. Also, since we have
vmalloc() fallback, add __GFP_NORETRY so that we don't invoke the OOM
killer by kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL) with order == PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER.
