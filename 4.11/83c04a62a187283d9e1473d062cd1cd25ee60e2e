drm/i915: Use enum plane_id in VLV/CHV sprite code

Use intel_plane->id to derive the VLV/CHV sprite register offsets
instead of abusing plane->plane which is really meant to for
primary planes only.

v2: Convert assert_sprites_disabled() over as well
v3: Rename the reg macro parameter to 'plane_id' as well (Paulo)
