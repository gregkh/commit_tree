scsi: aacraid: Decrease adapter health check interval

Currently driver checks the health status of the adapter once every 24
hours. When that happens the driver becomes dependent on the kernel to
figure out if the  adapter is misbehaving. This might take some time
(when the adapter is idle). The driver currently has support to
restart/recover the controller when it fails, and decreasing the time
interval will help.

Fixed by decreasing check interval from 24 hours to 1 minute
