[media] stk1160: Check whether to use AC97 codec

Some STK1160-based devices use the chip's internal 8-bit ADC. This is
configured through a strap pin. The value of this and other pins can be
read through the POSVA register. If the internal ADC is used, or if
audio is disabled altogether, there's no point trying to setup the AC97
codec.
