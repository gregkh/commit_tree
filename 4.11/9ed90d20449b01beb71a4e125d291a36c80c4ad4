tty: move the non-file related parts of tty_release to new tty_release_struct

For in-kernel tty users, we need to be able to create and destroy
'struct tty' that are not associated with a file. The creation side is
fine, but tty_release() needs to be split into the file handle portion
and the struct tty portion. Introduce a new function, tty_release_struct,
to handle just the destroying of a struct tty.
