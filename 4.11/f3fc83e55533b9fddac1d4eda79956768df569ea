docs: Fix htmldocs build failure

Build of HTML docs failing due to conversion of deviceiobook.tmpl in
8a8a602f and regulator.tmpl in 028f2533 to RST without removing from
DOCBOOKS in Makefile, resulting (in the case of deviceiobook) the
following error:

make[1]: *** No rule to make target 'Documentation/DocBook/deviceiobook.xml', needed by 'Documentation/DocBook/deviceiobook.aux.xml'.  Stop.
Makefile:1452: recipe for target 'htmldocs' failed
make: *** [htmldocs] Error 2

Update DOCBOOKS to reflect available books.
