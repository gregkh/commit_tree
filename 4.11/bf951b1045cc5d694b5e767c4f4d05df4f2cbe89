Revert "virtio_pci: simplify MSI-X setup"

This reverts commit 52a61516125fa9a21b3bdf4f90928308e2e5573f.

Conflicts:
	drivers/virtio/virtio_pci_common.c

The cleanup seems to be one of the changes that broke
hybernation for some users. We are still not sure why
but revert helps.

This reverts the cleanup changes but keeps the affinity support.
