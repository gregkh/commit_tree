powerpc/kernel: Fix unbalanced refcount on RTAS device node

The RTAS device-tree node's refcount has been increased by one in
the function call of_find_node_by_name(), but it's missed to be
decreased by one in the error path. It leads to unbalanced refcount
on RTAS device-tree node.

This fixes above issue by decreasing RTAS device-tree node's refcount
in error path.
