debugobjects: Scale thresholds with # of CPUs

On a large SMP systems with hundreds of CPUs, the current thresholds
for allocating and freeing debug objects (256 and 1024 respectively)
may not work well. This can cause a lot of needless calls to
kmem_aloc() and kmem_free() on those systems.

To alleviate this thrashing problem, the object freeing threshold
is now increased to "1024 + # of CPUs * 32". Whereas the object
allocation threshold is increased to "256 + # of CPUs * 4". That
should make the debug objects subsystem scale better with the number
of CPUs available in the system.
