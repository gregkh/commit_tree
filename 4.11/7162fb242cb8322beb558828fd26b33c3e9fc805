tcp: do not underestimate skb->truesize in tcp_trim_head()

Andrey found a way to trigger the WARN_ON_ONCE(delta < len) in
skb_try_coalesce() using syzkaller and a filter attached to a TCP
socket over loopback interface.

I believe one issue with looped skbs is that tcp_trim_head() can end up
producing skb with under estimated truesize.

It hardly matters for normal conditions, since packets sent over
loopback are never truncated.

Bytes trimmed from skb->head should not change skb truesize, since
skb->head is not reallocated.
