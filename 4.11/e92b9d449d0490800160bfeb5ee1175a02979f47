usb: gadget: uac2: add req_number as parameter

There are only two requests for uac2, it may not be enough at high
loading system which usb interrupt handler can't be serviced on
time, then the data will be lost since it is isoc transfer for audio.

In this patch, we introduce a parameter for the number for usb request,
and the user can override it if current number for request is not enough
for his/her use case.

Besides, update this parameter for legacy audio gadget and documentation.
