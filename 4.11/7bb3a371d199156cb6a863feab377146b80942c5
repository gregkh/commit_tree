f2fs: Fix zoned block device support

The introduction of the multi-device feature partially broke the support
for zoned block devices. In the function f2fs_scan_devices, sbi->devs
allocation and initialization is skipped in the case of a single device
mount. This result in no device information structure being allocated
for the device. This is fine if the device is a regular device, but in
the case of a zoned block device, the device zone type array is not
initialized, which causes the function __f2fs_issue_discard_zone to fail
as get_blkz_type is unable to determine the zone type of a section.

Fix this by always allocating and initializing the sbi->devs device
information array even in the case of a single device if that device is
zoned. For this particular case, make sure to obtain a reference on the
single device so that the call to blkdev_put() in destroy_device_list
operates as expected.
