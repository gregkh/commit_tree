docs / driver-api: Fix structure references in device_link.rst

The format of the structure references in device_link.rst is
incorrect, because it doesn't cause proper references to the
struct data types to be generated (for struct dev_pm_domain in
particular).

Fix that by using the :c:type:`struct name <name>` convention
for encoding references to struct data types.
