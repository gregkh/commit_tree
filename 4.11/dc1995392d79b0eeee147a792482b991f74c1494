sched/headers: Remove <linux/sched.h> from <linux/sched/stat.h>

The <linux/sched/stat.h> file is a largely self-contained header and users of
it either don't need <linux/sched.h> - or have already included it.

( Keep the <linux/percpu.h> dependency.)

This reduces the size of the header dependency graph.
