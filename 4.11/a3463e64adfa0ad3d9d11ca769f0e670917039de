staging: lustre: ptlrpc : remove userland usage from ptlrpc

The reason for __REQ_LAYOUT_USER__ was to expose a
section of code in layout.c to userland for a utility
similar to wireshark. This was done before wireshark
existed but now that it does we no longer need to do
this type of hack. This also reduces lustre_acl.h to
strictly a kernel header now.
