drm/i915: Expand is_lp backwards to gen8_lp and gen7_lp.

Valleyview/Baytrail (gen7_lp) and Cherryview/Braswell (gen8_lp)
are both Atom platforms like Broxton/Apollolake and Geminilake.

So let's expand this is_lp back to these platforms and
create the IS_LP(dev_priv) so we can start simplifying a bit
our if/else for platform lists.
