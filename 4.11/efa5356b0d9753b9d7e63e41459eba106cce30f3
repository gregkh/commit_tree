bridge: per vlan dst_metadata netlink support

This patch adds support to attach per vlan tunnel info dst
metadata. This enables bridge driver to map vlan to tunnel_info
at ingress and egress. It uses the kernel dst_metadata infrastructure.

The initial use case is vlan to vni bridging, but the api is generic
to extend to any tunnel_info in the future:
    - Uapi to configure/unconfigure/dump per vlan tunnel data
    - netlink functions to configure vlan and tunnel_info mapping
    - Introduces bridge port flag BR_LWT_VLAN to enable attach/detach
    dst_metadata to bridged packets on ports. off by default.
    - changes to existing code is mainly refactor some existing vlan
    handling netlink code + hooks for new vlan tunnel code
    - I have kept the vlan tunnel code isolated in separate files.
    - most of the netlink vlan tunnel code is handling of vlan-tunid
    ranges (follows the vlan range handling code). To conserve space
    vlan-tunid by default are always dumped in ranges if applicable.

Use case:
example use for this is a vxlan bridging gateway or vtep
which maps vlans to vn-segments (or vnis).

iproute2 example (patched and pruned iproute2 output to just show
relevant fdb entries):
example shows same host mac learnt on two vni's and
vlan 100 maps to vni 1000, vlan 101 maps to vni 1001

before (netdev per vni):
$bridge fdb show | grep "00:02:00:00:00:03"
00:02:00:00:00:03 dev vxlan1001 vlan 101 master bridge
00:02:00:00:00:03 dev vxlan1001 dst 12.0.0.8 self
00:02:00:00:00:03 dev vxlan1000 vlan 100 master bridge
00:02:00:00:00:03 dev vxlan1000 dst 12.0.0.8 self

after this patch with collect metdata in bridged mode (single netdev):
$bridge fdb show | grep "00:02:00:00:00:03"
00:02:00:00:00:03 dev vxlan0 vlan 101 master bridge
00:02:00:00:00:03 dev vxlan0 src_vni 1001 dst 12.0.0.8 self
00:02:00:00:00:03 dev vxlan0 vlan 100 master bridge
00:02:00:00:00:03 dev vxlan0 src_vni 1000 dst 12.0.0.8 self
