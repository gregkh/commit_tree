blk-mq-sched: fix crash in switch error path

In elevator_switch(), if blk_mq_init_sched() fails, we attempt to fall
back to the original scheduler. However, at this point, we've already
torn down the original scheduler's tags, so this causes a crash. Doing
the fallback like the legacy elevator path is much harder for mq, so fix
it by just falling back to none, instead.
