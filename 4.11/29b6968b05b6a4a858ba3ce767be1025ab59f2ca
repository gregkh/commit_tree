PM / devfreq: Remove unnecessary separate _remove_devfreq()

The _remove_devfreq() releases the all resources of the devfreq
device. This function is only called in the devfreq_dev_release().
For that reason, the devfreq core doesn't need to leave the
_remove_devfreq() separately. This patch releases the all
resources in the devfreq_dev_release() and then removes the
_remove_devfreq().
