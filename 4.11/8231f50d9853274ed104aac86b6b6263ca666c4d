KVM: x86: prevent setup of invalid routes

The check in kvm_set_pic_irq() and kvm_set_ioapic_irq() was just a
temporary measure until the code improved enough for us to do this.

This changes APIC in a case when KVM_SET_GSI_ROUTING is called to set up pic
and ioapic routes before KVM_CREATE_IRQCHIP.  Those rules would get overwritten
by KVM_CREATE_IRQCHIP at best, so it is pointless to allow it.  Userspaces
hopefully noticed that things don't work if they do that and don't do that.
