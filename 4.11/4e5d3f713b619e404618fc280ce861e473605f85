cpufreq: intel_pstate: Make HWP limits compatible with legacy

Under HWP the performance limits are calculated using max_perf_pct
and min_perf_pct using possible performance, not available performance.
The available performance can be reduced by no_turbo setting. To make
compatible with legacy mode, use max/min performance percentage with
respect to available performance.
