staging: vc04_services: Fix messages appearing twice

An issue was observed when flushing openmax components
which generate a large number of messages returning
buffers to host.

We occasionally found a duplicate message from 16
messages prior, resulting in a buffer returned twice.

So fix the issue by adding more memory barriers.
