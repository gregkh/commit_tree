qed: Align CIDs according to DORQ requirement

The Doorbell HW block can be configured at a granularity
of 16 x CIDs, so we need to make sure that the actual number
of CIDs configured would be a multiplication of 16.

Today, when RoCE is enabled - given that the number is unaligned,
doorbelling the higher CIDs would fail to reach the firmware and
would eventually timeout.
