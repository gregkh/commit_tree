drm/i915: Use enum plane_id in VLV/CHV wm code

Let's try not to abuse plane->plane for sprites on VLV/CHV and instead
use plane->id. Since out watermark structures aren't entirely plane type
agnostic (for now) and start indexing sprites from 0  we'll add a small
helper to convert between the two bases.
