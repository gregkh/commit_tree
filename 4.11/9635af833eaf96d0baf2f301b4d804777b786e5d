pinctrl: samsung: Remove support for Exynos4415 (SoC not supported anymore)

Support for Exynos4415 is going away because there are no internal nor
external users.

Since commit 46dcf0ff0de3 ("ARM: dts: exynos: Remove exynos4415.dtsi"),
the platform cannot be instantiated so remove also the drivers.
