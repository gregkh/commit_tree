power: supply: bq24735: always check for AC adapter presence in probe

So what if there is a status_gpio specified? bq24735_charger_is_present()
do have a working fallback for the case of no status_gpio.

Simplify this by not special casing setups w/o status_gpio, folding
two consecutive if-blocks in the process.
