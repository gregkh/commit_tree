drm/i915/guc: Init send_mutex in intel_uc_init_early()

send_mutex is used to serialise communication with GuC via
intel_guc_send().

Since functions that utilize it are no longer limited to submission,
initialization should be handled as a part of general setup.

v2: move initialization to *_early()
