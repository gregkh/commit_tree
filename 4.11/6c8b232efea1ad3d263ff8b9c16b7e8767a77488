blk-mq: make lifetime consistent between hctx and its kobject

This patch removes kobject_put() over hctx in __blk_mq_unregister_dev(),
and trys to keep lifetime consistent between hctx and hctx's kobject.

Now blk_mq_sysfs_register() and blk_mq_sysfs_unregister() become
totally symmetrical, and kobject's refcounter drops to zero just
when the hctx is freed.
