Introduce STATIC_USERMODEHELPER to mediate call_usermodehelper()

Some usermode helper applications are defined at kernel build time, while
others can be changed at runtime.  To provide a sane way to filter these, add a
new kernel option "STATIC_USERMODEHELPER".  This option routes all
call_usermodehelper() calls through this binary, no matter what the caller
wishes to have called.

The new binary (by default set to /sbin/usermode-helper, but can be changed
through the STATIC_USERMODEHELPER_PATH option) can properly filter the
requested programs to be run by the kernel by looking at the first argument
that is passed to it.  All other options should then be passed onto the proper
program if so desired.

To disable all call_usermodehelper() calls by the kernel, set
STATIC_USERMODEHELPER_PATH to an empty string.

Thanks to Neil Brown for the idea of this feature.
