cgroup: track migration context in cgroup_mgctx

cgroup migration is performed in four steps - css_set preloading,
addition of target tasks, actual migration, and clean up.  A list
named preloaded_csets is used to track the preloading.  This is a bit
too restricted and the code is already depending on the subtlety that
all source css_sets appear before destination ones.

Let's create struct cgroup_mgctx which keeps track of everything
during migration.  Currently, it has separate preload lists for source
and destination csets and also embeds cgroup_taskset which is used
during the actual migration.  This moves struct cgroup_taskset
definition to cgroup-internal.h.

This patch doesn't cause any functional changes.
