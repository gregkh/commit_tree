crypto: cavium - fix Kconfig dependencies

The driver fails to build if MSI support is disabled:

In file included from /git/arm-soc/drivers/crypto/cavium/cpt/cptpf_main.c:18:0:
drivers/crypto/cavium/cpt/cptpf.h:57:20: error: array type has incomplete element type 'struct msix_entry'
  struct msix_entry msix_entries[CPT_PF_MSIX_VECTORS];
                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/crypto/cavium/cpt/cptpf_main.c: In function 'cpt_enable_msix':
drivers/crypto/cavium/cpt/cptpf_main.c:344:8: error: implicit declaration of function 'pci_enable_msix';did you mean 'cpt_enable_msix'? [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

On the other hand, it doesn't seem to have any build dependency on ARCH_THUNDER,
so let's allow compile-testing to catch this kind of problem more easily.
The 64-bit dependency is needed for the use of readq/writeq.
