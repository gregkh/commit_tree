USB: serial: digi_acceleport: fix OOB-event processing

A recent change claimed to fix an off-by-one error in the OOB-port
completion handler, but instead introduced such an error. This could
specifically led to modem-status changes going unnoticed, effectively
breaking TIOCMGET.

Note that the offending commit fixes a loop-condition underflow and is
marked for stable, but should not be backported without this fix.
