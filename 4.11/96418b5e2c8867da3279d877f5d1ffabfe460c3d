scsi: lpfc: Fix eh_deadline setting for sli3 adapters.

A previous change unilaterally removed the hba reset entry point
from the sli3 host template. This was done to allow tape devices
being used for back up from being removed. Why was this done ?
When there was non-responding device on the fabric, the error
escalation policy would escalate to the reset handler. When the
reset handler was called, it would reset the adapter, dropping
link, thus logging out and terminating all i/o's - on any target.
If there was a tape device on the same adapter that wasn't in
error, it would kill the tape i/o's, effectively killing the
tape device state.  With the reset point removed, the adapter
reset avoided the fabric logout, allowing the other devices to
continue to operate unaffected. A hack - yes. Hint: we really
need a transport I_T nexus reset callback added to the eh process
(in between the SCSI target reset and hba reset points), so a
fc logout could occur to the one bad target only and stop the error
escalation process.

This patch commonizes the approach so it can be used for sli3 and sli4
adapters, but mandates the admin, via module parameter, specifically
identify which adapters the resets are to be removed for. Additionally,
bus_reset, which sends Target Reset TMFs to all targets, is also removed
from the template as it too has the same effect as the adapter reset.
