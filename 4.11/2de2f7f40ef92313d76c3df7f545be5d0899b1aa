virtio_net: XDP support for adjust_head

Add support for XDP adjust head by allocating a 256B header region
that XDP programs can grow into. This is only enabled when a XDP
program is loaded.

In order to ensure that we do not have to unwind queue headroom push
queue setup below bpf_prog_add. It reads better to do a prog ref
unwind vs another queue setup call.

At the moment this code must do a full reset to ensure old buffers
without headroom on program add or with headroom on program removal
are not used incorrectly in the datapath. Ideally we would only
have to disable/enable the RX queues being updated but there is no
API to do this at the moment in virtio so use the big hammer. In
practice it is likely not that big of a problem as this will only
happen when XDP is enabled/disabled changing programs does not
require the reset. There is some risk that the driver may either
have an allocation failure or for some reason fail to correctly
negotiate with the underlying backend in this case the driver will
be left uninitialized. I have not seen this ever happen on my test
systems and for what its worth this same failure case can occur
from probe and other contexts in virtio framework.
