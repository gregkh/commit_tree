netlink: do not enter direct reclaim from netlink_trim()

In commit d35c99ff77ecb ("netlink: do not enter direct reclaim from
netlink_dump()") we made sure to not trigger expensive memory reclaim.

Problem is that a bit later, netlink_trim() might be called and
trigger memory reclaim.

netlink_trim() should be best effort, and really as fast as possible.
Under memory pressure, it is fine to not trim this skb.
