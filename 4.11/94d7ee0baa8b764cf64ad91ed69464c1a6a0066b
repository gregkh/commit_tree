l2tp: hold tunnel socket when handling control frames in l2tp_ip and l2tp_ip6

The code following l2tp_tunnel_find() expects that a new reference is
held on sk. Either sk_receive_skb() or the discard_put error path will
drop a reference from the tunnel's socket.

This issue exists in both l2tp_ip and l2tp_ip6.
