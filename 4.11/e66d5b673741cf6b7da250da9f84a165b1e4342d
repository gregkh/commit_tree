selftest: cpufreq: Add support for cpufreq tests

This patch adds supports for basic cpufreq tests, which can be performed
independent of any platform.

It does basic tests for now, like
- reading all cpufreq files
- trying to update them
- switching frequencies
- switching governors

This can be extended to have more specific tests later on.
