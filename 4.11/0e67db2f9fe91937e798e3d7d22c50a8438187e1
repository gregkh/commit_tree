kernfs: add kernfs_ops->open/release() callbacks

Add ->open/release() methods to kernfs_ops.  ->open() is called when
the file is opened and ->release() when the file is either released or
severed.  These callbacks can be used, for example, to manage
persistent caching objects over multiple seq_file iterations.
