rtlwifi: rtl8192cu: Calculate descriptor checksum correctly for BE

This driver requires a checksum for the descriptors so that the wifi
chip is assured that the USB transmission was correct. These entries
are little-endian, but the driver was always using cpu order in the
calculation. As a result, the driver failed on BE hardware.
