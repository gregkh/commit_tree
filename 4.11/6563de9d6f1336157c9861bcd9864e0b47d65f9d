rcu: Abstract the dynticks momentary-idle operation

This commit is the first step towards full abstraction of all accesses to
the ->dynticks counter, implementing the previously open-coded atomic add
of two in a new rcu_dynticks_momentary_idle() function.  This abstraction
will ease changes to the ->dynticks counter operation.

Note that this commit gets rid of the smp_mb__before_atomic() and the
smp_mb__after_atomic() calls that were previously present.  The reason
that this is OK from a memory-ordering perspective is that the atomic
operation is now atomic_add_return(), which, as a value-returning atomic,
guarantees full ordering.
