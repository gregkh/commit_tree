ARM: 8654/1: decompressor: add strlen prototype

The decompress.c file contains a declaration for strstr() so we can
include some compression library code.

With the updated LZ4 implementation, we run into the same problem again
for strlen():

In file included from ../include/linux/rcupdate.h:40:0,
                 from ../include/linux/srcu.h:33,
                 from ../include/linux/notifier.h:15,

                 from ../arch/arm/boot/compressed/decompress.c:55:
include/linux/cpumask.h: In function 'cpumask_parse':
include/linux/cpumask.h:592:53: error: implicit declaration of function 'strlen';did you mean 'strstr'? [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

This adds another declaration to work around the new problem.
