i40e: no need to check is_vsi_in_vlan before calling i40e_del_mac_all_vlan

This function won't be appreciably slower when in VLAN mode, so there is
no real reason to not just call it directly. In either case, we still
must search the full table for a MAC/VLAN pair. We do get to stop
searching a tiny bit early in the case of knowing we are not in VLAN
mode, but this is a minor savings and we can avoid the code complexity
by not having to worry about the check.
