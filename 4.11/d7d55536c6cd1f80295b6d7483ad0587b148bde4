drivers/pci/hotplug: Handle presence detection change properly

The surprise hotplug is driven by interrupt in PowerNV PCI hotplug
driver. In the interrupt handler, pnv_php_interrupt(), we bail when
pnv_pci_get_presence_state() returns zero wrongly. It causes the
presence change event is always ignored incorrectly.

This fixes the issue by bailing on error (non-zero value) returned
from pnv_pci_get_presence_state().
