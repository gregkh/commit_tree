serial: 8250_omap: pause DMA only if DMA transfer in progress

It is possible that DMA transfer is already complete but, completion
handler is yet to be called, when dmaengine_pause() is called in case of
error condition(like break/rx timeout). This leads to dmaengine_pause()
API to return EINVAL (as descriptor is already NULL) causing
rx_dma_broken flag to be set and effectively disabling RX DMA.
Fix this by calling dmaengine_pause() only when transfer is in progress.
