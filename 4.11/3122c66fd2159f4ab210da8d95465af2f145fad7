ASoC: Intel: Use DMI name for sound card long name in Broadwell machine driver

Intel Broadwell machine driver will call API snd_soc_set_dmi_name() to
use DMI info to make the sound card long name.

For example, here are the changed long name for two Broadwell-based
machines:
Dell XPS-13(2015): DellInc.-XPS139343-01-0310JH
Intel WilsonBeach: Intel Corp.-BroadwellClientplatform-0.1-WilsonBeachSDS

They still share the same card name "broadwell-rt286".
