MIPS: End spinlocks with .insn

When building for microMIPS we need to ensure that the assembler always
knows that there is code at the target of a branch or jump. Recent
toolchains will fail to link a microMIPS kernel when this isn't the case
due to what it thinks is a branch to non-microMIPS code.

mips-mti-linux-gnu-ld kernel/built-in.o: .spinlock.text+0x2fc: Unsupported branch between ISA modes.
mips-mti-linux-gnu-ld final link failed: Bad value

This is due to inline assembly labels in spinlock.h not being followed
by an instruction mnemonic, either due to a .subsection pseudo-op or the
end of the inline asm block.

Fix this with a .insn direction after such labels.
