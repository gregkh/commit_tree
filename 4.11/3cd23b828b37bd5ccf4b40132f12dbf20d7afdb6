drm/i915/gvt: GVT pin/unpin shadow context

When handling guest request, GVT needs to populate/update shadow_ctx
with guest context. This behavior needs to make sure the shadow_ctx
is pinned. The current implementation is relying on i195 allocate request
to pin but this way cannot guarantee the i915 not to unpin the shadow_ctx
when GVT update the guest context from shadow_ctx. So GVT should pin/unpin
the shadow_ctx by itself.
