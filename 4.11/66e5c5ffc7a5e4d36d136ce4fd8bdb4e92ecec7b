HID: multitouch: enable Surface 4 Type Cover Pro (non-JP) to report multitouch data

Nearly identical to the patch "multitouch: enable the Surface 4 Type Cover Pro
(JP) to report multitouch data"

We can now remove the support of the Surface 4 Type Cover Pro (not JP versions)
from hid-microsoft so it can properly report multi touch from the touchpad.
