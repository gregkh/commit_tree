extcon: palmas: Check the parent instance to prevent the NULL

extcon-palmas must be child of palmas and expects parent's
drvdata to be valid. Check for non NULL parent drvdata and
fail if it is NULL. Not doing so will result in a NULL
pointer dereference later in the probe() parent drvdata
is NULL (e.g. misplaced extcon-palmas node in device tree).
