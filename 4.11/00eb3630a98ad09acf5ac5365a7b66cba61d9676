ARM: dts: imx: remove obsoleted property fsl,spi-num-chipselects

Since commit b36581df7e78 ("spi: imx: Using existing properties for
chipselects") the device tree property 'fsl,spi-num-chipselects' is
unused and it is already marked as obsolete in device tree binding
documentation. Remove the property from the existing DTS files to
avoid its reoccurence on copying.
