Subject: netlink: Annotate nlk cb_mutex by protocol

Currently all occurences of nlk->cb_mutex are annotated by lockdep
as a single class.  This causes a false lcokdep cycle involving
genl and crypto_user.

This patch fixes it by dividing cb_mutex into individual classes
based on the netlink protocol.  As genl and crypto_user do not
use the same netlink protocol this breaks the false dependency
loop.
