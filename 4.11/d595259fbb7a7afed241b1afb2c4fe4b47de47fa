usb-storage: Add ignore-residue quirk for Initio INIC-3619

This USB-SATA bridge chip is used in a StarTech enclosure for
optical drives.

Without the quirk MakeMKV fails during the key exchange with an
installed BluRay drive:
> Error 'Scsi error - ILLEGAL REQUEST:COPY PROTECTION KEY EXCHANGE FAILURE - KEY NOT ESTABLISHED'
> occurred while issuing SCSI command AD010..080002400 to device 'SG:dev_11:2'
