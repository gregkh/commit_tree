usb: dwc2: gadget: Set TX FIFO depths to calculated defaults

Remove legacy DWC2_G_P_LEGACY_TX_FIFO_SIZE array for TX FIFOs.
Update dwc2_set_param_tx_fifo_sizes function to calculate
and assign default average FIFO depth to each member of
g_tx_fifo_size array. Total FIFO size, EP Info block's size,
FIFO operation mode and device operation mode are taken into
consideration during the calculation.
