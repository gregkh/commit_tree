ipv6: ignore null_entry in inet6_rtm_getroute() too

Like commit 1f17e2f2c8a8 ("net: ipv6: ignore null_entry on route dumps"),
we need to ignore null entry in inet6_rtm_getroute() too.

Return -ENETUNREACH here to sync with IPv4 behavior, as suggested by David.

Fixes: a1a22c1206 ("net: ipv6: Keep nexthop of multipath route on admin down")
