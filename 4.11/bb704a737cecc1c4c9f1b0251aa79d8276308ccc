ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Configure DMA in PRE_PMD handler of Mixer

If system is suspended when PCM was paused/stopped, restart doesn't
configure DMA as it is we are in Pause state and results in IO error
eventually.

Configure host/link DMA before initializing DSP Gateway copier module
instead of DAI prepare(). So moved DMA configuration to mixer PRE_PMD
widget handler instead of DAI prepare.

This uses previously added new API to do the configuration and removes
old DAI prepare code.
