clk: qcom: gdsc: Fix handling of hw control enable/disable

Once a gdsc is brought in and out of HW control, there is a
power down and up cycle which can take upto 1us. Polling on
the gdsc status immediately after the hw control enable/disable
can mislead software/firmware to belive the gdsc is already either on
or off, while its yet to complete the power cycle.
To avoid this add a 1us delay post a enable/disable of HW control
mode.

Also after the HW control mode is disabled, poll on the status to
check gdsc status reflects its 'on' before force disabling it
in software.
