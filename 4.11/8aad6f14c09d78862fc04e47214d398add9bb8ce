qed: Fix copy of uninitialized memory

In qed_ll2_start_ooo() the ll2_info variable is uninitialized and then
passed to qed_ll2_acquire_connection() where it is copied into a new
memory space.

This shouldn't cause any issue as long as non of the copied memory is
every read.
But the potential for a bug being introduced by reading this memory
is real.
