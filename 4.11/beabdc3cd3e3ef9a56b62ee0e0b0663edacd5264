USB: serial: keyspan: drop header file

Move all declarations and definitions in keyspan.h to keyspan.c, which
is the only place were they are used.

This specifically moves the driver device-id tables and usb-serial
driver definitions to the source file where they are expected to be
found.

While at it, fix up some multi-line comments and minor white-space
issues (spaces instead of tabs and superfluous white space).

Note that the information in the comment header of the removed header
file is also present in the source file.
