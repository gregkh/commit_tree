fpga zynq: Check for errors after completing DMA

The completion did not check the interrupt status to see if any error
bits were asserted, check error bits and dump some registers if things
went wrong.

A few fixes are needed to make this work, the IXR_ERROR_FLAGS_MASK was
wrong, it included the done bits, which shows a bug in mask/unmask_irqs
which were using the wrong bits, simplify all of this stuff.
