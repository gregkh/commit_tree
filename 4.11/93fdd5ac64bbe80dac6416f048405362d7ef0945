scsi: ufs: refactor device descriptor reading

Pull device descriptor reading out of ufs quirk so it can be used also
for other purposes.

Revamp the fixup setup:

1. Rename ufs_device_info to ufs_dev_desc as very similar name
   ufs_dev_info is already in use.

2. Make the handlers static as they are not used out of the ufshdc.c
   file.
