gpio: acpi: Call enable_irq_wake for _IAE GpioInts with Wake set

On Bay Trail / Cherry Trail systems with a LID switch, the LID switch is
often connect to a gpioint handled by an _IAE event handler.
Before this commit such systems would not wake up when opening the lid,
requiring the powerbutton to be pressed after opening the lid to wakeup.

Note that Bay Trail / Cherry Trail systems use suspend-to-idle, so
the interrupts are generated anyway on those lines on lid switch changes,
but they are treated by the IRQ subsystem as spurious while suspended if
not marked as wakeup IRQs.

This commit calls enable_irq_wake() for _IAE GpioInts with a valid
event handler which have their Wake flag set. This fixes such systems
not waking up when opening the lid.
