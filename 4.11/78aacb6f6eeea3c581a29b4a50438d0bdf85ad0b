net: thunderx: Fix invalid mac addresses for node1 interfaces

When booted with ACPI, random mac addresses are being
assigned to node1 interfaces due to mismatch of bgx_id
in BGX driver and ACPI tables.

This patch fixes this issue by setting maximum BGX devices
per node based on platform/soc instead of a macro. This
change will set the bgx_id appropriately.
