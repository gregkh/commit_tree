net/mlx5e: Bring back bfreg uar map dedicated pointer

4K Uar series modified the mlx5e driver to use the new bfreg API,
and mistakenly removed the sq->uar_map iomem data path dedicated
pointer, which was meant to be read from xmit path for cache locality
utilization.

Fix that by returning that pointer to the SQ struct.
