KVM: MIPS/MMU: Drop kvm_get_new_mmu_context()

MIPS KVM uses its own variation of get_new_mmu_context() which takes an
extra vcpu pointer (unused) and does exactly the same thing.

Switch to just using get_new_mmu_context() directly and drop KVM's
version of it as it doesn't really serve any purpose.

The nearby declarations of kvm_mips_alloc_new_mmu_context(),
kvm_mips_vcpu_load() and kvm_mips_vcpu_put() are also removed from
kvm_host.h, as no definitions or users exist.
