platform/x86: intel_pmc_ipc: Add APL PMC PCI Id

This patch adds the PCI Device id for Power Management Controller on Intel
Apollo Lake platforms.

Intel PMC IPC Driver loads as a platform driver on Apollo Lake platforms
since Intel BIOS hides the PCI Configuration space for 0:13:1 and
re-enumerates it as ACPI device (INT34D2). The correct PCI Device ID should
be added if some platform firmware choses to enumerate the device via PCI
space.
