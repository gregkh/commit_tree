power: supply: tps65217: Support USB charger interrupt

TPS65217 has two charger interrupts - AC and USB power status change.

Interrupt number in the TPS65217 driver data:
  IRQ number is only used on requesting the interrupt, so no need to keep
  it inside the driver data.

Interrupt handler:
  Check not only AC but also USB charger status.
  In both cases, enable charging operation.

Interrupt request:
  If an interrupt number is invalid, then use legacy polling thread.
  Otherwise, create IRQ threads to handle AC and USB charger event.
