drm/i915: Hold a reference on the request for its fence chain

Currently, we have an active reference for the request until it is
retired. Though it cannot be retired before it has been executed by
hardware, the request may be completed before we have finished
processing the execute fence, i.e. we may continue to process that fence
as we free the request.

Fixes: 5590af3e115a ("drm/i915: Drive request submission through fence callbacks")
Fixes: 23902e49c999 ("drm/i915: Split request submit/execute phase into two")
