serial: exar: Move Commtech adapters to 8250_exar as well

Those are Exar-based, too.

With the required refactoring of the code to fit into 8250_exar, we
automatically fix the same issue pci_xr17v35x_setup had before: 8XMODE,
FCTL, TXTRG and RXTRG were always only set for port 0. Now they are
initialized for the correct target port by using port.membase.

Now we can also cleanly fix the blacklist of 8250_pci so that all
Commtech devices are rejected and 8250_exar can handle them.
