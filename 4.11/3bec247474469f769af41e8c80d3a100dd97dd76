iio: hid-sensor-trigger: Change get poll value function order to avoid sensor properties losing after resume from S3

In function _hid_sensor_power_state(), when hid_sensor_read_poll_value()
is called, sensor's all properties will be updated by the value from
sensor hardware/firmware.
In some implementation, sensor hardware/firmware will do a power cycle
during S3. In this case, after resume, once hid_sensor_read_poll_value()
is called, sensor's all properties which are kept by driver during S3
will be changed to default value.
But instead, if a set feature function is called first, sensor
hardware/firmware will be recovered to the last status. So change the
sensor_hub_set_feature() calling order to behind of set feature function
to avoid sensor properties lose.
