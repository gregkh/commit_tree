mmc: core: Fix access to HS400-ES devices

HS400-ES devices fail to initialize with the following error messages.

mmc1: power class selection to bus width 8 ddr 0 failed
mmc1: error -110 whilst initialising MMC card

This was seen on Samsung Chromebook Plus. Code analysis points to
commit 3d4ef329757c ("mmc: core: fix multi-bit bus width without
high-speed mode"), which attempts to set the bus width for all but
HS200 devices unconditionally. However, for HS400-ES, the bus width
is already selected.
