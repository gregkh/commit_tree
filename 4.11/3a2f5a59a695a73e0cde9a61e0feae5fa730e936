security,selinux,smack: kill security_task_wait hook

As reported by yangshukui, a permission denial from security_task_wait()
can lead to a soft lockup in zap_pid_ns_processes() since it only expects
sys_wait4() to return 0 or -ECHILD. Further, security_task_wait() can
in general lead to zombies; in the absence of some way to automatically
reparent a child process upon a denial, the hook is not useful.  Remove
the security hook and its implementations in SELinux and Smack.  Smack
already removed its check from its hook.
