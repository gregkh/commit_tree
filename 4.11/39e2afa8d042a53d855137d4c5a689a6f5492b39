IB/hfi1: Use static CTLE with Preset 6 for integrated HFIs

After extended testing, it was found that the previous PCIe Gen
3 recipe, which used adaptive CTLE with Preset 4, could cause an
NMI/Surprise Link Down in about 1 in 100 to 1 in 1000 power cycles on
some platforms. New EV data combined with extensive empirical data
indicates that the new recipe should use static CTLE with Preset 6 for
all integrated silicon SKUs.
