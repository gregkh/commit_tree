ipv4: fib: Notify about nexthop status changes

When a multipath route is hit the kernel doesn't consider nexthops that
are DEAD or LINKDOWN when IN_DEV_IGNORE_ROUTES_WITH_LINKDOWN is set.
Devices that offload multipath routes need to be made aware of nexthop
status changes. Otherwise, the device will keep forwarding packets to
non-functional nexthops.

Add the FIB_EVENT_NH_{ADD,DEL} events to the fib notification chain,
which notify capable devices when they should add or delete a nexthop
from their tables.
