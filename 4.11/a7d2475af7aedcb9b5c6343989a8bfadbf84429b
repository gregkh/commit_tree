powerpc: Sort the selects under CONFIG_PPC

We have a big list of selects under CONFIG_PPC, and currently they're
completely unsorted. This means people tend to add new selects at the
bottom of the list, and so two commits which both add a new select will
often conflict.

Instead sort it alphabetically. This is nicer in and of itself, but also
means two commits that add a new select will have a greater chance of
not conflicting.

Add a note at the top and bottom asking people to keep it sorted.

And while we're here pad out the 'if' expressions to make them stand
out.
