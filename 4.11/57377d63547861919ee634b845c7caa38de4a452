l2tp: ensure session can't get removed during pppol2tp_session_ioctl()

Holding a reference on session is required before calling
pppol2tp_session_ioctl(). The session could get freed while processing the
ioctl otherwise. Since pppol2tp_session_ioctl() uses the session's socket,
we also need to take a reference on it in l2tp_session_get().
