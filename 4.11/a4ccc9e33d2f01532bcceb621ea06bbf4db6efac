Bluetooth: btusb: Configure Marvell to use one of the pins for oob wakeup

The Marvell devices may have many gpio pins, and hence for wakeup
on these out-of-band pins, the chip needs to be told which pin is
to be used for wakeup, using an hci command.

Thus, we read the pin number etc from the device tree node and send
a command to the chip.
