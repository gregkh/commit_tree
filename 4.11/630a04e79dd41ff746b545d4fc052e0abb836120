xfs: verify inline directory data forks

When we're reading or writing the data fork of an inline directory,
check the contents to make sure we're not overflowing buffers or eating
garbage data.  xfs/348 corrupts an inline symlink into an inline
directory, triggering a buffer overflow bug.

v2: add more checks consistent with _dir2_sf_check and make the verifier
usable from anywhere.
