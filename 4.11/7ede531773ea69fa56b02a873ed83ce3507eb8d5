KVM: PPC: Book3S: Move 64-bit KVM interrupt handler out from alt section

A subsequent patch to make KVM handlers relocation-safe makes them
unusable from within alt section "else" cases (due to the way fixed
addresses are taken from within fixed section head code).

Stop open-coding the KVM handlers, and add them both as normal. A more
optimal fix may be to allow some level of alternate feature patching in
the exception macros themselves, but for now this will do.

The TRAMP_KVM handlers must be moved to the "virt" fixed section area
(name is arbitrary) in order to be closer to .text and avoid the dreaded
"relocation truncated to fit" error.
