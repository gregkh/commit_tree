tcp: fix reordering SNMP under-counting

Currently the reordering SNMP counters only increase if a connection
sees a higher degree then it has previously seen. It ignores if the
reordering degree is not greater than the default system threshold.
This significantly under-counts the number of reordering events
and falsely convey that reordering is rare on the network.

This patch properly and faithfully records the number of reordering
events detected by the TCP stack, just like the comment says "this
exciting event is worth to be remembered". Note that even so TCP
still under-estimate the actual reordering events because TCP
requires TS options or certain packet sequences to detect reordering
(i.e. ACKing never-retransmitted sequence in recovery or disordered
 state).
