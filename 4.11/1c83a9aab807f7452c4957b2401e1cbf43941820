ext4: move halfmd4 into hash.c directly

The "half md4" transform should not be used by any new code. And
fortunately, it's only used now by ext4. Since ext4 supports several
hashing methods, at some point it might be desirable to move to
something like SipHash. As an intermediate step, remove half md4 from
cryptohash.h and lib, and make it just a local function in ext4's
hash.c. There's precedent for doing this; the other function ext can use
for its hashes -- TEA -- is also implemented in the same place. Also, by
being a local function, this might allow gcc to perform some additional
optimizations.
