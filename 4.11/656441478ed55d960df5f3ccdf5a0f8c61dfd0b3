mtd: nand: ifc: Fix location of eccstat registers for IFC V1.0

The commit 7a654172161c ("mtd/ifc: Add support for IFC controller
version 2.0") added support for version 2.0 of the IFC controller.
The version 2.0 controller has the ECC status registers at a different
location to the previous versions.

Correct the fsl_ifc_nand structure so that the ECC status can be read
from the correct location for both version 1.0 and 2.0 of the controller.
