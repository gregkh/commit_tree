dm space map common: memcpy the disk root to ensure it's arch aligned

The metadata_space_map_root passed to sm_ll_open_metadata() may or may
not be arch aligned, use memcpy to ensure it is.  This is not a fast
path so the extra memcpy doesn't hurt us.

Long-term it'd be better to use the kernel's alignment infrastructure to
remove the memcpy()s that are littered across persistent-data (btree,
array, space-maps, etc).
