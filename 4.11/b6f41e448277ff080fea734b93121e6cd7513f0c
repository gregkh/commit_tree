xfs: remove boilerplate around xfs_btree_init_block

Now that xfs_btree_init_block_int is able to determine crc
status from the passed-in mp, we can determine the proper
magic as well if we are given a btree number, rather than
an explicit magic value.

Change xfs_btree_init_block[_int] callers to pass in the
btree number, and let xfs_btree_init_block_int use the
xfs_magics array via the xfs_btree_magic macro to determine
which magic value is needed.  This makes all of the
if (crc) / else stanzas identical, and the if/else can be
removed, leading to a single, common init_block call.
