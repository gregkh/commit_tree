net/mlx5e: Fix small packet threshold

RX packet headers are meant to be contained in SKB linear part,
and chose a threshold of 128.
It turns out this is not enough, i.e. for IPv6 packet over VxLAN.
In this case, UDP/IPv4 needs 42 bytes, GENEVE header is 8 bytes,
and 86 bytes for TCP/IPv6. In total 136 bytes that is more than
current 128 bytes. In this case expand header flow is reached.
The warning in skb_try_coalesce() caused by a wrong truesize
was already fixed here:
commit 158f323b9868 ("net: adjust skb->truesize in pskb_expand_head()").
Still, we prefer to totally avoid the expand header flow for performance reasons.
Tested regular TCP_STREAM with iperf for 1 and 8 streams, no degradation was found.
