drm/i915/lspcon: Wait for expected LSPCON mode to settle

Some LSPCON adaptors may return an incorrect LSPCON mode right after
waking from DP Sleep state. This is the case at least for the ParadTech
PS175 adaptor, both when waking because of exiting the DP Sleep to
active state, or due to any other AUX CH transfer. We can determine the
current expected mode based on whether the DPCD area is accessible,
since according to the LSPCON spec this area is only accesible
in PCON mode.

This wait will avoid us trying to change the mode, while the current
expected mode hasn't settled yet and start link training before the
adaptor thinks it's in PCON mode after waking from DP Sleep state.
