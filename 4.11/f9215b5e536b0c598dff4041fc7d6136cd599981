IB/rdmavt, IB/hfi1, IB/qib: Correct ack count for passive (RTR) QPs

The send complete for RC QPs mismanages the ack count when the
responder side is only in RTR.

A QP in that state cannot send requests, but it can be the target
for operations that elicit responses.

Adjust the RC completion logic to correct the count maintenance
by reflecting RECV_OK in a new state test.
