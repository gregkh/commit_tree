lightnvm: add ioctls for vector I/Os

Enable user-space to issue vector I/O commands through ioctls. To issue
a vector I/O, the ppa list with addresses is also required and must be
mapped for the controller to access.

For each ioctl, the result and status bits are returned as well, such
that user-space can retrieve the open-channel SSD completion bits.

The implementation covers the traditional use-cases of bad block
management, and vectored read/write/erase.
