tools/power turbostat: show all columns, independent of --debug

Some time ago, turbostat overflowed 80 columns.

So on the assumption that a "casual" user would always
want topology and frequency columns, we hid the rest
of the columns and the system configuration decoding
behind the --debug option.

Not everybody liked that change -- including me.
I use --debug 99% of the time...

Well, now we have "-o file" to put turbostat output into a file,
so unless you are watching real-time in a small window,
column count is less frequently a factor.

And more recently, we got the "--hide columnA,columnB" option
to specify columns to skip.

So now we "un-hide" the rest of the columns from behind --debug,
and show them all, by default.
