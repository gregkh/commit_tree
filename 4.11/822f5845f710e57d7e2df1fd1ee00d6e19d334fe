efi/esrt: Cleanup bad memory map log messages

The Intel Compute Stick STCK1A8LFC and Weibu F3C platforms both
log 2 error messages during boot:

   efi: requested map not found.
   esrt: ESRT header is not in the memory map.

Searching the web, this seems to affect many other platforms too.
Since these messages are logged as errors, they appear on-screen during
the boot process even when using the "quiet" boot parameter used by
distros.

Demote the ESRT error to a warning so that it does not appear on-screen,
and delete the error logging from efi_mem_desc_lookup; both callsites
of that function log more specific messages upon failure.

Out of curiosity I looked closer at the Weibu F3C. There is no entry in
the UEFI-provided memory map which corresponds to the ESRT pointer, but
hacking the code to map it anyway, the ESRT does appear to be valid with
2 entries.
