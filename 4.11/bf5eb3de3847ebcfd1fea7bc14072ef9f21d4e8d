slub: separate out sysfs_slab_release() from sysfs_slab_remove()

Separate out slub sysfs removal and release, and call the former earlier
from __kmem_cache_shutdown().  There's no reason to defer sysfs removal
through RCU and this will later allow us to remove sysfs files way
earlier during memory cgroup offline instead of release.
