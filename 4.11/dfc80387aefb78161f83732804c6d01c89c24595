serial: sh-sci: Compute the regshift value for SCI ports

SCI instances found in SH SoCs have different spacing between registers
depending on the SoC. The platform data contains a regshift field that
tells the driver by how many bits to shift the register offset to
compute its address. We can compute the regshift value automatically
based on the memory resource size, there's no need to pass the value
through platform data.

Fix the sh7750 SCI and sh7760 SIM port memory resources length to ensure
proper computation of the regshift value.
