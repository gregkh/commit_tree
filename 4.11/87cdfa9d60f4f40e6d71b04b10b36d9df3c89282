hwmon: (gl520sm) Fix overflows and crash seen when writing into limit attributes

Writes into limit attributes can overflow due to multplications and
additions with unbound input values. Writing into fan limit attributes
can result in a crash with a division by zero if very large values are
written and the fan divider is larger than 1.
