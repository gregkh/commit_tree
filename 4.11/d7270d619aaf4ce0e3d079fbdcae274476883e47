iwlwifi: pcie: re-configure IVAR table after suspend-resume

During the suspend/resume flow some HW blocks are reset.  This causes
the IVAR table to be completely erased.  This table is where interrupt
causes are bound to specific IRQs.  When the table is empty the
interrupt handlers are not called correctly.  Fix this by reconfiguring
the IVAR table after resume.
