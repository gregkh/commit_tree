platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Call led_classdev_notify_brightness_hw_changed on kbd brightness change

Make thinkpad_acpi call led_classdev_notify_brightness_hw_changed on the
kbd_led led_classdev registered by thinkpad_acpi when the kbd backlight
brightness is changed through the hotkey.

This will allow userspace to monitor (poll) for brightness changes on
these LEDs caused by the hotkey.
