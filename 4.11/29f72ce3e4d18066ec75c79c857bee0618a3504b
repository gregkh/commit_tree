x86/mce/AMD: Give a name to MCA bank 3 when accessed with legacy MSRs

MCA bank 3 is reserved on systems pre-Fam17h, so it didn't have a name.
However, MCA bank 3 is defined on Fam17h systems and can be accessed
using legacy MSRs. Without a name we get a stack trace on Fam17h systems
when trying to register sysfs files for bank 3 on kernels that don't
recognize Scalable MCA.

Call MCA bank 3 "decode_unit" since this is what it represents on
Fam17h. This will allow kernels without SMCA support to see this bank on
Fam17h+ and prevent the stack trace. This will not affect older systems
since this bank is reserved on them, i.e. it'll be ignored.

Tested on AMD Fam15h and Fam17h systems.
