net/mlx5e: Receive s-tagged packets in promiscuous mode

Today when the driver enter to promiscuous mode or vlan
filter is disabled, we add flow rule to receive any c-taggd
packets, therefore s-tagged packets are dropped.
In order to receive s-tagged packets as well we need to add
flow rule to receive any s-tagged packet.
