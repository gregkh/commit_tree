mei: don't wait for os version message reply

The driver still struggles with firmwares that do not replay to the OS
version request. It is safe not waiting for the replay. First, the driver
doesn't do anything with the replay second the connection is closed
immediately, hence the packet will be just safely discarded in case it
is received and last the driver won't get stuck if the firmware won't
reply.
