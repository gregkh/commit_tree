powerpc/mm/4k: don't allocate larger pmd page table for 4k

We now support THP with both 64k and 4K page size configuration
for radix. (hash only support THP with 64K page size). Hence we
will have CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE enabled for both PPC_64K
and PPC_4K config. Since we only need large pmd page table
with hash configuration (to store the slot information
in the second half of the table) restrict the large pmd page table
to THP and 64K configs.
