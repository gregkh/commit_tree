dm verity fec: limit error correction recursion

If the hash tree itself is sufficiently corrupt in addition to data blocks,
it's possible for error correction to end up in a deep recursive loop,
which eventually causes a kernel panic.  This change limits the
recursion to a reasonable level during a single I/O operation.
