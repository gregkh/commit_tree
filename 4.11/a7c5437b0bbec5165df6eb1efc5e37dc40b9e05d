debugfs: add debugfs_lookup()

We don't always have easy access to the dentry of a file or directory we
created in debugfs. Add a helper which allows us to get a dentry we
previously created.

The motivation for this change is a problem with blktrace and the blk-mq
debugfs entries introduced in 07e4fead45e6 ("blk-mq: create debugfs
directory tree"). Namely, in some cases, the directory that blktrace
needs to create may already exist, but in other cases, it may not. We
_could_ rely on a bunch of implied knowledge to decide whether to create
the directory or not, but it's much cleaner on our end to just look it
up.
