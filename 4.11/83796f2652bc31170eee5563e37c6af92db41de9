drm/i915/guc: Make sure vma containing firmware is GuC mappable

Since commit 4741da925fa3 ("drm/i915/guc: Assert that all GGTT offsets used
by the GuC are mappable"), we're asserting that GuC firmware is in the
GuC mappable range.
Except we're not pinning the object with bias, which means it's possible
to trigger this assert. Let's add a proper bias.
