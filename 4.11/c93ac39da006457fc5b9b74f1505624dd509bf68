rtlwifi: Remove some redundant code

The symbol DBG_EMERG is no longer used and is removed.

In a number of places, the code has redundant messages. For example, if
the failure for the firmware to run is logged, it is not necessary to
log that the firmware has been started. In addition, extraneous braces are
removed.
