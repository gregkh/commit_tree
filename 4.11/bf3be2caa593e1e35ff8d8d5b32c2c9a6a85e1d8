clk: sunxi-ng: Call divider_round_rate if we only have a single parent

The divider_get_val function that is used in our determine_rate callback
doesn't try to change the parent rate at all, while clk_divider_bestdiv,
used in divider_round_rate, does.

If we have a single parent, call divider_round_rate.
