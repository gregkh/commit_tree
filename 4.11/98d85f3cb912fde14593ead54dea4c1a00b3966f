[media] media: Properly pass through media entity types in entity enumeration

When the functions replaced media entity types, the range which was
allowed for the types was incorrect. This meant that media entity types
for specific devices were not passed correctly to the userspace through
MEDIA_IOC_ENUM_ENTITIES. Fix it.

Fixes: commit b2cd27448b33 ("[media] media-device: map new functions into old types for legacy API")
