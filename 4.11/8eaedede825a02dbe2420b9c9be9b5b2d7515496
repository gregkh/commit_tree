mm: fix handling PTE-mapped THPs in page_referenced()

For PTE-mapped THP page_check_address_transhuge() is not adequate: it
cannot find all relevant PTEs, only the first one.  It means we can miss
some references of the page and it can result in suboptimal decisions by
vmscan.

Let's switch it to page_vma_mapped_walk().

I don't think it's subject for stable@: it's not fatal.  The only side
effect is that THP can be swapped out when it shouldn't.
