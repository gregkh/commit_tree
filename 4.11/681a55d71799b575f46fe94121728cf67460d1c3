tipc: move premature initilalization of stack variables

In the function tipc_rcv() we initialize a couple of stack variables
from the message header before that same header has been validated.
In rare cases when the arriving header is non-linar, the validation
function itself may linearize the buffer by calling skb_may_pull(),
while the wrongly initialized stack fields are not updated accordingly.

We fix this in this commit.
