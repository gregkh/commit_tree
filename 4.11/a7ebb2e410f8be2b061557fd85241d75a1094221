KVM: MIPS/T&E: active_mm = init_mm in guest context

Set init_mm as the active_mm and update mm_cpumask(current->mm) to
reflect that it isn't active when in guest context. This prevents cache
management code from attempting cache flushes on host virtual addresses
while in guest context, for example due to a cache management IPIs or
later when writing of dynamically translated code hits copy on write.

We do this using helpers in static kernel code to avoid having to export
init_mm to modules.
