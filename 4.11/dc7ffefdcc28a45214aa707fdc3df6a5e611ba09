staging/lustre/lnet: Fix allocation size for sv_cpt_data

This is unbreaking another of those "stealth" janitor
patches that got in and subtly broke some things.

sv_cpt_data is a pointer to pointer, so need to
dereference it twice to allocate the correct structure size.

Fixes: 9899cb68c6c2 ("Staging: lustre: rpc: Use sizeof type *pointer instead of sizeof type.")
