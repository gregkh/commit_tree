staging: fsl-mc: don't use devres api for refcounted objects

Mixing two memory management systems, in this case
managed device resource api and refcounted objects
is a bad idea. Lifetime of an object is controlled
by its refcount so allocating it with other apis
that have their own lifetime control is not ok.
Drop devm_*() apis in favor of plain allocations.
