usb: musb: cppi41: Detect aborted transfers in cppi41_dma_callback()

Update cppi41_dma_callback() to detect an aborted transfer.
This was not required before because cppi41_dma_callback() was only
invoked on transfer completion.
In order to make CPPI 4.1 driver more generic, cppi41_dma_callback()
will be invoked after a transfer abort in order to let the MUSB driver
perform some action such as acknowledge the interrupt that may be fired
during a teardown.
