KVM: MIPS: Drop vm_init() callback

Now that the commpage doesn't use wired TLB entries, the per-CPU
vm_init() callback is the only work done by kvm_mips_init_vm_percpu().

The trap & emulate implementation doesn't actually need to do anything
from vm_init(), and the future VZ implementation would be better served
by a kvm_arch_hardware_enable callback anyway.

Therefore drop the vm_init() callback entirely, allowing the
kvm_mips_init_vm_percpu() function to also be dropped, along with the
kvm_mips_instance atomic counter.
