l2tp: rework socket comparison in __l2tp_ip*_bind_lookup()

Split conditions, so that each test becomes clearer.

Also, for l2tp_ip, check if "laddr" is 0. This prevents a socket from
binding to the unspecified address when other sockets are already bound
using the same device (if any), connection ID and namespace.

Same thing for l2tp_ip6: add ipv6_addr_any(laddr) and
ipv6_addr_any(raddr) tests to ensure that an IPv6 unspecified address
passed as parameter is properly treated a wildcard.
