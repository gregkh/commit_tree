userfaultfd: non-cooperative: add event for memory unmaps

When a non-cooperative userfaultfd monitor copies pages in the
background, it may encounter regions that were already unmapped.
Addition of UFFD_EVENT_UNMAP allows the uffd monitor to track precisely
changes in the virtual memory layout.

Since there might be different uffd contexts for the affected VMAs, we
first should create a temporary representation for the unmap event for
each uffd context and then notify them one by one to the appropriate
userfault file descriptors.

The event notification occurs after the mmap_sem has been released.
