serial: st-asc: Use new GPIOD API to obtain RTS pin

The commits mentioned below adapt the GPIO API to allow more information
to be passed directly through devm_get_gpiod_from_child() in the first
instance.  This facilitates the removal of subsequent calls, such as
gpiod_direction_output().  This patch firstly moves to utilise the new
API and secondly removes the now superfluous call do set the direction.
