drm: Get atomic property value even if DRIVER_ATOMIC is not set

i915 does not set DRIVER_ATOMIC by default yet but uses atomic_check and
atomic_commit. drm_object_property_get_value() does not read the correct
value of atomic properties if DRIVER_ATOMIC is not set. Checking whether
the driver uses atomic modeset is a better check instead as the property
values are tracked in the state structures.
