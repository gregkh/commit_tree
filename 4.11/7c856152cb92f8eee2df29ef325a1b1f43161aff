scsi: sd: Fix capacity calculation with 32-bit sector_t

We previously made sure that the reported disk capacity was less than
0xffffffff blocks when the kernel was not compiled with large sector_t
support (CONFIG_LBDAF). However, this check assumed that the capacity
was reported in units of 512 bytes.

Add a sanity check function to ensure that we only enable disks if the
entire reported capacity can be expressed in terms of sector_t.
