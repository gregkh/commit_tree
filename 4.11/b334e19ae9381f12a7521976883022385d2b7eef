Kbuild: use cc-disable-warning consistently for maybe-uninitialized

In commit a76bcf557ef4 ("Kbuild: enable -Wmaybe-uninitialized warning
for "make W=1""), I reverted another change that happened to fix a problem
with old compilers, and now we get this report again with old compilers
(prior to gcc-4.8) and GCOV enabled:

   cc1: warnings being treated as errors
   drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_ringbuffer.c: In function 'intel_ring_setup_status_page':
   drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_ringbuffer.c:438: error: 'mmio.reg' may be used uninitialized in this function
   At top level:
>> cc1: error: unrecognized command line option "-Wno-maybe-uninitialized"

The problem is that we turn off the warning conditionally in a number
of places as we should, but one of them does it unconditionally.
Instead, change it to call cc-disable-warning as we do elsewhere.

The original patch that caused it was merged into linux-4.7, then
4.8 removed the change and 4.9 brought it back, so we probably want
a backport to 4.9 once this is merged.

Use a ':=' assignment instead of '=' to force the cc-disable-warning
call to only be evaluated once instead of every time.
