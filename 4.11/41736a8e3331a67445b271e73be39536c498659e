drm/i915: Use the precomputed value for whether to enable command parsing

As i915.enable_cmd_parser is an unsafe option, make it read-only at
runtime. Now that it is constant, we can use the value determined during
initialisation as to whether we need the cmdparser at execbuffer time.

v2: Remove the inline for its single user, it is clear enough (and
shorter) without!
