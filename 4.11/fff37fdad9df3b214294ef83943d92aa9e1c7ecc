net: thunderx: Leave serdes lane config on 81/83xx to firmware

For DLMs and SLMs on 80/81/83xx, many lane configurations
across different boards are coming up. Also kernel doesn't have
any way to identify board type/info and since firmware does,
just get rid of figuring out lane to serdes config and take
whatever has been programmed by low level firmware.
