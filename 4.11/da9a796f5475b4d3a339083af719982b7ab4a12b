drm/i915: Split GEM resetting into 3 phases

Currently we do a reset prepare/finish around the call to reset the GPU,
but it looks like we need a later stage after the hw has been
reinitialised to allow GEM to restart itself. Start by splitting the 2
GEM phases into 3:

  prepare - before the reset, check if GEM recovered, then stop GEM

  reset - after the reset, update GEM bookkeeping

  finish - after the re-initialisation following the reset, restart GEM
