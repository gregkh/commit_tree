ARM: 8627/1: avoid cache flushing in flush_dcache_page()

When the data cache is PIPT or VIPT non-aliasing, and cache operations
are broadcast by the hardware, we can always postpone the flush in
flush_dcache_page().  A similar change was done for ARM64 in commit
b5b6c9e9149d ("arm64: Avoid cache flushing in flush_dcache_page()").
