IB/mlx5: Reorder code in query device command

The order of features exposed by private mlx5-abi.h
file is CQE zipping, packet pacing and multi-packet WQE.

The internal order implemented in mlx5_ib_query_device() is
multi-packet WQE, CQE zipping and packet pacing.

Such difference hurts code readability, so let's sync,
while mlx5-abi.h (exposed to userspace) is the primary
order.

This commit doesn't change any functionality.
