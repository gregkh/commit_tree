netfilter: nf_tables: add flush field to struct nft_set_iter

This provides context to walk callback iterator, thus, we know if the
walk happens from the set flush path. This is required by the new bitmap
set type coming in a follow up patch which has no real struct
nft_set_ext, so it has to allocate it based on the two bit compact
element representation.
