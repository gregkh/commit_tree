ucount: Remove the atomicity from ucount->count

Always increment/decrement ucount->count under the ucounts_lock.  The
increments are there already and moving the decrements there means the
locking logic of the code is simpler.  This simplification in the
locking logic fixes a race between put_ucounts and get_ucounts that
could result in a use-after-free because the count could go zero then
be found by get_ucounts and then be freed by put_ucounts.

A bug presumably this one was found by a combination of syzkaller and
KASAN.  JongWhan Kim reported the syzkaller failure and Dmitry Vyukov
spotted the race in the code.
