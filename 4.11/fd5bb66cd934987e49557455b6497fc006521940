zswap: don't param_set_charp while holding spinlock

Change the zpool/compressor param callback function to release the
zswap_pools_lock spinlock before calling param_set_charp, since that
function may sleep when it calls kmalloc with GFP_KERNEL.

While this problem has existed for a while, I wasn't able to trigger it
using a tight loop changing either/both the zpool and compressor params; I
think it's very unlikely to be an issue on the stable kernels, especially
since most zswap users will change the compressor and/or zpool from sysfs
only one time each boot - or zero times, if they add the params to the
kernel boot.
