Revert "netfilter: nf_tables: add flush field to struct nft_set_iter"

This reverts commit 1f48ff6c5393aa7fe290faf5d633164f105b0aa7.

This patch is not required anymore now that we keep a dummy list of
set elements in the bitmap set implementation, so revert this before
we forget this code has no clients.
