PCI: Disable MSI for HiSilicon Hip06/Hip07 Root Ports

The PCIe Root Port in Hip06/Hip07 SoCs advertises an MSI capability, but it
cannot generate MSIs.  It can transfer MSI/MSI-X from downstream devices,
but does not support MSI/MSI-X itself.

Add a quirk to prevent use of MSI/MSI-X by the Root Port.
