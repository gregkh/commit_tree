crypto: atmel-sha - fix error management in atmel_sha_start()

This patch clarifies and fixes how errors should be handled by
atmel_sha_start().

For update operations, the previous code wrongly assumed that
(err != -EINPROGRESS) implies (err == 0). It's wrong because that doesn't
take the error cases (err < 0) into account.

This patch also adds many comments to detail all the possible returned
values and what should be done in each case.

Especially, when an error occurs, since atmel_sha_complete() has already
been called, hence releasing the hardware, atmel_sha_start() must not call
atmel_sha_finish_req() later otherwise atmel_sha_complete() would be
called a second time.
