net: netcp: ale: update to support unknown vlan controls for NU switch

In NU Ethernet switch used on some of the Keystone SoCs, there is
separate UNKNOWNVLAN register for membership, unreg mcast flood, reg
mcast flood and force untag egress bits in ALE. So control for these
fields require different address offset, shift and size of field.
As this ALE has the same version number as ALE in CPSW found on other
SoCs, customization based on version number is not possible. So
use a configuration parameter, nu_switch_ale, to identify the ALE
ALE found in NU Switch. Different treatment is needed for NU Switch
ALE due to difference in the ale table bits, separate unknown vlan
registers etc. The register information available in ale_controls,
needs to be updated to support the netcp NU switch h/w. So it is not
constant array any more since it needs to be updated based
on ALE type. The header of the file is also updated to indicate it
supports N port switch ALE, not just 3 port. The version mask is
3 bits in NU Switch ALE vs 8 bits on other ALE types.

While at it, change the debug print to info print so that ALE
version gets displayed in boot log.
