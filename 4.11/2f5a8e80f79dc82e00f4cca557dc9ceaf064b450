ide: don't abuse cmd_type

Currently the legacy ide driver defines several request types of it's own,
which is in the way of removing that field entirely.

Instead add a type field to struct ide_request and use that to distinguish
the different types of IDE-internal requests.

It's a bit of a mess, but so is the surrounding code..
