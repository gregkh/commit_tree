video: fbdev: maxinefb: add __initdata to maxinefb_fix

The object maxinefb_fix of type fb_fix_screeninfo is never referenced
after initialization by maxinefb_init. In the init function, the object
and one of its fields is only stored into another variable. So, the
object and its fields are never referenced anywhere after initialization
and therefore add __initdata to its declaration.
