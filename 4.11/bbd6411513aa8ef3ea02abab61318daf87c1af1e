KVM: Support vCPU-based gfn->hva cache

Provide versions of struct gfn_to_hva_cache functions that
take vcpu as a parameter instead of struct kvm.  The existing functions
are not needed anymore, so delete them.  This allows dirty pages to
be logged in the vcpu dirty ring, instead of the global dirty ring,
for ring-based dirty memory tracking.
