powerpc/xmon: Update ppc-dis/opc.c and ppc.h

Upgrade ppc-opc.c, ppc-dis.c and ppc.h to the versions belonging to the
following binutils commit:

  65b650b4c7463f4508bed523c24ab0031a5ae5cd
  * ppc-dis.c (print_insn_powerpc): Don't skip all operands after
    setting skip_optional.

That is the last version of those files that were licensed under GPLv2.

This leaves the code in a state that does not compile, because the
binutils code needs to be tweaked to work in the kernel. We don't fix
that in this commit, because we want to import more binutils changes in
subsequent commits. So for now we mark XMON_DISASSEMBLY as BROKEN, so it
can't be built.
