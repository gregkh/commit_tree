flow dissector: check if arp_eth is null rather than arp

arp is being checked instead of arp_eth to see if the call to
__skb_header_pointer failed. Fix this by checking arp_eth is
null instead of arp.   Also fix to use length hlen rather than
hlen - sizeof(_arp); thanks to Eric Dumazet for spotting
this latter issue.

CoverityScan CID#1396428 ("Logically dead code") on 2nd
arp comparison (which should be arp_eth instead).

Fixes: commit 55733350e5e8b70c5 ("flow disector: ARP support")
