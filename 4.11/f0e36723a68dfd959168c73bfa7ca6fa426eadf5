drm: Document drm_cache interface

Notice that this uncovers an issue with the kernel-doc handling of array
arguments, causing the first parameter of drm_clflush_pages() to not
show up in the rst-generated page.  A proposed fix is under review in
linux-doc: <http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-doc/msg42544.html>

Changes since v1:
 - Add section to drm-mm.rst.
 - Fix kernel-doc style issues.
 - s/memory/kernel memory/.
