KVM: PPC: Book 3S: XICS: correct the real mode ICP rejecting counter

Some counters are added in Commit 6e0365b78273 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV:
Add ICP real mode counters"), to provide some performance statistics to
determine whether further optimizing is needed for real mode functions.

The n_reject counter counts how many times ICP rejects an irq because of
priority in real mode. The redelivery of an lsi that is still asserted
after eoi doesn't fall into this category, so the increasement there is
removed.

Also, it needs to be increased in icp_rm_deliver_irq() if it rejects
another one.
