serial: sh-sci: SCIFA/B RX FIFO software timeout

Implements support for FIFO fill thresholds greater than one with software
timeout.

This mechanism is not possible (or at least not useful) on SCIF family
hardware other than SCIFA and SCIFB because they do not support turning off
the DR hardware timeout interrupt separately from the RI interrupt.
