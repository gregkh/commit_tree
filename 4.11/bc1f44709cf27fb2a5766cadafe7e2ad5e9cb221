net: make ndo_get_stats64 a void function

The network device operation for reading statistics is only called
in one place, and it ignores the return value. Having a structure
return value is potentially confusing because some future driver could
incorrectly assume that the return value was used.

Fix all drivers with ndo_get_stats64 to have a void function.
