drm/i915: replace platform flags with a platform enum

The platform flags in device info are (mostly) mutually
exclusive. Replace the flags with an enum. Add the platform enum also
for platforms that previously didn't have a flag, and give them codename
logging in dmesg.

Pineview remains an exception, the platform being G33 for that.

v2: Sort enum by gen and date

v3: rebase on geminilake enabling
