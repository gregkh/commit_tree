btrfs: merge nr_pages input and output parameter in compress_pages

The parameter saying how many pages can be allocated at maximum can be
merged with the output page counter, to save some stack space.  The
compression implementation will sink the parameter to a local variable
so everything works as before.

The nr_pages variables can also be simply merged in compress_file_range
into one.
