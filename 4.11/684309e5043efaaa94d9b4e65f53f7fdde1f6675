pwm: lpss: Avoid potential overflow of base_unit

The resolution of base_unit is derived from base_unit_bits and thus must be
equal to (2^base_unit_bits - 1). Otherwise frequency and therefore base_unit
might potentially overflow.

Prevent the above by substracting 1 in all cases where base_unit_bits or
derivative is used.
