mm, dax: make pmd_fault() and friends be the same as fault()

Instead of passing in multiple parameters in the pmd_fault() handler,
a vmf can be passed in just like a fault() handler. This will simplify
code and remove the need for the actual pmd fault handlers to allocate a
vmf. Related functions are also modified to do the same.
