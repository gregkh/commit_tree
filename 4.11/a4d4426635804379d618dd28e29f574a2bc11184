openrisc: head: Init r0 to 0 on start

Originally openrisc spec 0 specified that r0 would be wired to ground.
This is no longer the case.  r0 is not guaranteed to be 0 at init, so we
need to initialize it to 0 before using it.

Also, if we are clearing r0 we cant use r0 to clear itself. Change the
the CLEAR_GPR macro to use movhi for clearing.
