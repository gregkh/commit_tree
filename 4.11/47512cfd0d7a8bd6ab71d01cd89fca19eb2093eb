x86/platform/goldfish: Prevent unconditional loading

The goldfish platform code registers the platform device unconditionally
which causes havoc in several ways if the goldfish_pdev_bus driver is
enabled:

 - Access to the hardcoded physical memory region, which is either not
   available or contains stuff which is completely unrelated.

 - Prevents that the interrupt of the serial port can be requested

 - In case of a spurious interrupt it goes into a infinite loop in the
   interrupt handler of the pdev_bus driver (which needs to be fixed
   seperately).

Add a 'goldfish' command line option to make the registration opt-in when
the platform is compiled in.

I'm seriously grumpy about this engineering trainwreck, which has seven
SOBs from Intel developers for 50 lines of code. And none of them figured
out that this is broken. Impressive fail!
