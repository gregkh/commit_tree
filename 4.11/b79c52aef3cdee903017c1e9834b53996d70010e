drm/i915/gvt: Activate/de-activate vGPU in mdev ops.

This patch introduces two functions for activating/de-activating vGPU in
mdev ops.

A racing condition was found between virtual vblank emulation and KVGMT
mdev release path. V-blank emulation will emulate and inject V-blank
interrupt for every active vGPU with holding gvt->lock, while in mdev
release path, it will directly release hypervisor handle without changing
vGPU status or taking gvt->lock, so a kernel oops is encountered when
vblank emulation is injecting a interrupt with a invalid hypervisor
handle. (Reported by Terrence)

To solve this problem, we factor out vGPU activation/de-activation from
vGPU creation/destruction path and let KVMGT mdev release ops de-activate
the vGPU before release hypervisor handle. Once a vGPU is de-activated,
GVT-g will not emulate v-blank for it or touch the hypervisor handle.
