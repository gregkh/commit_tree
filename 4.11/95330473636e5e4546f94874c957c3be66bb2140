checkpatch: remove false unbalanced braces warning

Lines containing "} else {" should not be detected as unbalanced braces.
But the second check can be reduced to ".+else\s*{" and it therefore
never checked if the beginning of a line contains any other character
(like the relevant "}").  This check would also return true for "} else
{" and create warnings like

    CHECK: Unbalanced braces around else statement
    #391: FILE: ./net/batman-adv/tvlv.c:391:
    +   } else {

The check can be changed to check the whole line for the missing "}" to
avoid this false positive.
