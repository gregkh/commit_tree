MIPS: Lantiq: Fix cascaded IRQ setup

With the IRQ stack changes integrated, the XRX200 devices started
emitting a constant stream of kernel messages like this:

[  565.415310] Spurious IRQ: CAUSE=0x1100c300

This is caused by IP0 getting handled by plat_irq_dispatch() rather than
its vectored interrupt handler, which is fixed by commit de856416e714
("MIPS: IRQ Stack: Fix erroneous jal to plat_irq_dispatch").

Fix plat_irq_dispatch() to handle non-vectored IPI interrupts correctly
by setting up IP2-6 as proper chained IRQ handlers and calling do_IRQ
for all MIPS CPU interrupts.
