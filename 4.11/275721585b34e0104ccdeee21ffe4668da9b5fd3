platform/x86: intel_mid_thermal: Remove duplicated platform device ID

Commit 3fca3d3d5075 ("platform-x86: intel_mid_thermal: add msic_thermal
alias") added a "msic_thermal" entry to the driver's platform device ID
table since that was the platform dev name registered in some platforms
and the only dev in the platform table was "msic_sensor" (DRIVER_NAME).

But then commit 634830704d80 ("x86/mid/thermal: Add msic_thermal alias")
changed DRIVER_NAME from "msic_sensor" to "msic_thermal", and so there's
now duplicated entries in the platform device ID table.
