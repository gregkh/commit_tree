exit: fix the setns() && PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER interaction

find_new_reaper() checks same_thread_group(reaper, child_reaper) to
prevent the cross-namespace reparenting but this is not enough if the
exiting parent was injected by setns() + fork().

Suppose we have a process P in the root namespace and some namespace X.
P does setns() to enter the X namespace, and forks the child C.
C forks a grandchild G and exits.

The grandchild G should be re-parented to X->child_reaper, but in this
case the ->real_parent chain does not lead to ->child_reaper, so it will
be wrongly reparanted to P's sub-reaper or a global init.
