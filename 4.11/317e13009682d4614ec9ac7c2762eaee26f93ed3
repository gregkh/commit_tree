f2fs: kill __is_extent_same

Since commit ee6d182f2a19 ("f2fs: remove syncing inode page in all the
cases") delayed inode element updating from inode cache to node page
cache, so once largest cached extent is updated, we can make inode dirty
immediately instead of checking and updating it in the end of extent
cache update.

The above commit didn't clean up unneeded codes in extent_cache.c, let's
finish the job in this patch.
