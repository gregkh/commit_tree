Input: sx8654 - add sx8655 and sx8656 to compatibles

As the sx865[456] share the same datasheet and differ only in the
presence of a "capacitive proximity detection circuit" and a "haptics
motor driver for LRA/ERM" add them to the compatbiles. As the driver
doesn't implement these features it should be no problem.
