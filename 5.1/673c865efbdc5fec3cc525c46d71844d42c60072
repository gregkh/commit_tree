spi: ti-qspi: Fix mmap read when more than one CS in use

Commit 4dea6c9b0b64 ("spi: spi-ti-qspi: add mmap mode read support") has
has got order of parameter wrong when calling regmap_update_bits() to
select CS for mmap access. Mask and value arguments are interchanged.
Code will work on a system with single slave, but fails when more than
one CS is in use. Fix this by correcting the order of parameters when
calling regmap_update_bits().
