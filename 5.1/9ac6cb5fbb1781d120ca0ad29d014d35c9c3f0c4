i2c: add suspended flag and accessors for i2c adapters

A few drivers open code the handling of suspended adapters. It could be
handled by the core, though, to ensure generic handling. This patch adds
the flag and accessor functions. The usage of these helpers is optional,
though. See the kerneldoc in this patch. Using the new flag, we now
reject further transfers if the adapter is already marked suspended.
