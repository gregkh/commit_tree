drm/i915/tv: only call intel_tv_init() on platforms that might have TV

With most platforms not having TV support, only call intel_tv_init() on
platforms that might actually have TV, specifically gens 3 and 4.

This puts intel_tv_init() more in line with the rest of the outputs, and
makes it slightly easier for the uninitiated to figure out which
platforms actually have what.
