drm/nouveau: fix missing break in switch statement

The NOUVEAU_GETPARAM_PCI_DEVICE case is missing a break statement and falls
through to the following NOUVEAU_GETPARAM_BUS_TYPE case and may end up
re-assigning the getparam->value to an undesired value. Fix this by adding
in the missing break.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1460507 ("Missing break in switch")
