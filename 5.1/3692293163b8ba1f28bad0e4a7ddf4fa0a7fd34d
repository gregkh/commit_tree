mac80211: Use rhashtable_lookup_get_insert_fast instead of racy code

The code in mesh_path_add tries to handle the case where a duplicate
entry is added to the rhashtable by doing a lookup after a failed
insertion.  It also tries to handle races by repeating the insertion
should the lookup fail.

This is now unnecessary as we have rhashtable API functions that can
directly return the mathcing object.
