KVM: x86/mmu: Zap only the relevant pages when removing a memslot

Modify kvm_mmu_invalidate_zap_pages_in_memslot(), a.k.a. the x86 MMU's
handler for kvm_arch_flush_shadow_memslot(), to zap only the pages/PTEs
that actually belong to the memslot being removed.  This improves
performance, especially why the deleted memslot has only a few shadow
entries, or even no entries.  E.g. a microbenchmark to access regular
memory while concurrently reading PCI ROM to trigger memslot deletion
showed a 5% improvement in throughput.
