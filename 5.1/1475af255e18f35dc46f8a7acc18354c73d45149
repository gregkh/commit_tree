HID: i2c-hid: Ignore input report if there's no data present on Elan touchpanels

While using Elan touchpads, the message floods:
[  136.138487] i2c_hid i2c-DELL08D6:00: i2c_hid_get_input: incomplete report (14/65535)

Though the message flood is annoying, the device it self works without
any issue. I suspect that the device in question takes too much time to
pull the IRQ back to high after I2C host has done reading its data.

Since the host receives all useful data, let's ignore the input report
when there's no data.
