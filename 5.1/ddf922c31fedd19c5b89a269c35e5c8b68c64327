IB/hfi1, IB/rdmavt: Allow for extending of QP's s_ack_queue

The OPFN protocol uses the COMPARE_SWAP request to exchange data
between the requester and the responder and therefore needs to
be stored in the QP's s_ack_queue when the request is received
on the responder side. However, because the user does not know
anything about the OPFN protocol, this extra entry in the
queue cannot be advertised to the user. This patch adds an extra
entry in a QP's s_ack_queue.
