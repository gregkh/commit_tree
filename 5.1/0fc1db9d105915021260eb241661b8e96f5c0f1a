tee: add bus driver framework for TEE based devices

Introduce a generic TEE bus driver concept for TEE based kernel drivers
which would like to communicate with TEE based devices/services. Also
add support in module device table for these new TEE based devices.

In this TEE bus concept, devices/services are identified via Universally
Unique Identifier (UUID) and drivers register a table of device UUIDs
which they can support.

So this TEE bus framework registers following apis:
- match(): Iterates over the driver UUID table to find a corresponding
  match for device UUID. If a match is found, then this particular device
  is probed via corresponding probe api registered by the driver. This
  process happens whenever a device or a driver is registered with TEE
  bus.
- uevent(): Notifies user-space (udev) whenever a new device is registered
  on this bus for auto-loading of modularized drivers.

Also this framework allows for device enumeration to be specific to
corresponding TEE implementation like OP-TEE etc.
