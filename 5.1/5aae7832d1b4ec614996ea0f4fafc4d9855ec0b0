drm/i915: Do not enable FEC without DSC

Currently we enable FEC even when DSC is no used. While that is
theoretically valid supposedly there isn't much of a benefit from
this. But more importantly we do not account for the FEC link
bandwidth overhead (2.4%) in the non-DSC link bandwidth computations.
So the code may think we have enough bandwidth when we in fact
do not.
