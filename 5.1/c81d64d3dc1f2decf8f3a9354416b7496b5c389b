io-64-nonatomic: add io{read|write}64[be]{_lo_hi|_hi_lo} macros

This patch adds generic io{read|write}64[be]{_lo_hi|_hi_lo} macros if
they are not already defined by the architecture. (As they are provided
by the generic iomap library).

The patch also points io{read|write}64[be] to the variant specified by the
header name.

This is because new drivers are encouraged to use ioreadXX, et al instead
of readX[1], et al -- and mixing ioreadXX with readq is pretty ugly.
