ASoC: Intel: Skylake: enable S24_LE format support

To enable S24_LE format, sample_type in topology fw has to be set to 1.
But sample_type defined in topology firmware configuration is not
getting reflected in the dsp param. This patch sets sample_type in base
config so that the sample type defined in the topology firmware is reflected
in the dsp params. This issues was uncovered while debugging the S24_LE format
which require the MSB byte in 32 bit word to be skipped. Setting sample_type
in topology firmware to 1 helps to skip MSB byte word.
