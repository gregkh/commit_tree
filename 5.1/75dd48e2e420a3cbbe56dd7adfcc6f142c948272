netfilter: nf_tables: Support RULE_ID reference in new rule

To allow for a batch to contain rules in arbitrary ordering, introduce
NFTA_RULE_POSITION_ID attribute which works just like NFTA_RULE_POSITION
but contains the ID of another rule within the same batch. This helps
iptables-nft-restore handling dumps with mixed insert/append commands
correctly.

Note that NFTA_RULE_POSITION takes precedence over
NFTA_RULE_POSITION_ID, so if the former is present, the latter is
ignored.
