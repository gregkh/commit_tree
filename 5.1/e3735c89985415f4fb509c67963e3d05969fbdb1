SUNRPC: remove pointless test in unx_match()

As reported by Dan Carpenter, this test for acred->cred being set is
inconsistent with the dereference of the pointer a few lines earlier.

An 'auth_cred' *always* has ->cred set - every place that creates one
initializes this field, often as the first thing done.

So remove this test.
