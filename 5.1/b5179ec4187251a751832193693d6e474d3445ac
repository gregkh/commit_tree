x86/kvmclock: set offset for kvm unstable clock

VMs may show incorrect uptime and dmesg printk offsets on hypervisors with
unstable clock. The problem is produced when VM is rebooted without exiting
from qemu.

The fix is to calculate clock offset not only for stable clock but for
unstable clock as well, and use kvm_sched_clock_read() which substracts
the offset for both clocks.

This is safe, because pvclock_clocksource_read() does the right thing and
makes sure that clock always goes forward, so once offset is calculated
with unstable clock, we won't get new reads that are smaller than offset,
and thus won't get negative results.

Thank you Jon DeVree for helping to reproduce this issue.
