KVM: arm/arm64: Add kvm_ras.h to collect kvm specific RAS plumbing

To split up APEIs in_nmi() path, the caller needs to always be
in_nmi(). KVM shouldn't have to know about this, pull the RAS plumbing
out into a header file.

Currently guest synchronous external aborts are claimed as RAS
notifications by handle_guest_sea(), which is hidden in the arch codes
mm/fault.c. 32bit gets a dummy declaration in system_misc.h.

There is going to be more of this in the future if/when the kernel
supports the SError-based firmware-first notification mechanism and/or
kernel-first notifications for both synchronous external abort and
SError. Each of these will come with some Kconfig symbols and a
handful of header files.

Create a header file for all this.

This patch gives handle_guest_sea() a 'kvm_' prefix, and moves the
declarations to kvm_ras.h as preparation for a future patch that moves
the ACPI-specific RAS code out of mm/fault.c.
