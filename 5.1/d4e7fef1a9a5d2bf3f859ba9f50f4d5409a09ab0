nvmem: core: Properly handle connection ID in of_nvmem_device_get()

of_nvmem_device_get() would crash if NULL was passed as a connection
ID. Rework this to use the usual sementic of assuming the first
connection when no connection ID is given.

Furthermore of_nvmem_device_get() would return -EINVAL when it failed
to resolve the connection, making it impossible to properly implement
an optional connection. Return -ENOENT instead to let the caller know
that the connection doesn't exists.
