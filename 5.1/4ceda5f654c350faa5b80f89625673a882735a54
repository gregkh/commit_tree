gnss: sirf: force hibernate mode on probe

Make sure to put the receiver in hibernate mode in case it is already
active during probe in order to avoid wasting power until first open or
suspend.

This can happen, for example, after a reset or non-clean shutdown, and
possibly also due to glitches during power-on.
