bnxt_en: Fix possible crash in bnxt_hwrm_ring_free() under error conditions.

If we encounter errors during open and proceed to clean up,
bnxt_hwrm_ring_free() may crash if the rings we try to free have never
been allocated.  bnxt_cp_ring_for_rx() or bnxt_cp_ring_for_tx()
may reference pointers that have not been allocated.

Fix it by checking for valid fw_ring_id first before calling
bnxt_cp_ring_for_rx() or bnxt_cp_ring_for_tx().
