virtio-net: per-queue RPS config

On multiqueue network devices, RPS maps are configured independently
for each receive queue through /sys/class/net/$DEV/queues/rx-*.

On virtio-net currently all packets use the map from rx-0, because the
real rx queue is not known at time of map lookup by get_rps_cpu.

Call skb_record_rx_queue in the driver rx path to make lookup work.

Recording the receive queue has ramifications beyond RPS, such as in
sticky load balancing decisions for sockets (skb_tx_hash) and XPS.
