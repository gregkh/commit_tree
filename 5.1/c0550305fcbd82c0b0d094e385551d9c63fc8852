drm/i915: Force background color to black for gen9+ (v2)

We don't yet allow userspace to control the CRTC background color, but
we should manually program the color to black to ensure the BIOS didn't
leave us with some other color.  We should also set the pipe gamma and
pipe CSC bits so that the background color goes through the same color
management transformations that a plane with black pixels would.

v2: Rename register to SKL_BOTTOM_COLOR to more closely follow
    bspec naming.  (Ville)
