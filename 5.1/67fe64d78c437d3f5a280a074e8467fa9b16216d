ice: Implement getting and setting ethtool coalesce

This patch includes the following ethtool operations:

1. get_coalesce
2. set_coalesce
3. get_per_q_coalesce
4. set_per_q_coalesce

Each ITR value (current_itr/target_itr) are stored on a per
ice_ring_container basis. This is because each valid ice_ring_container
can have 1 or more rings that are tied to the same q_vector ITR index.
