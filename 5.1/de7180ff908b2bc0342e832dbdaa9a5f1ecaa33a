dm cache: add support for discard passdown to the origin device

DM cache now defaults to passing discards down to the origin device.
User may disable this using the "no_discard_passdown" feature when
creating the cache device.

If the cache's underlying origin device doesn't support discards then
passdown is disabled (with warning).  Similarly, if the underlying
origin device's max_discard_sectors is less than a cache block discard
passdown will be disabled (this is required because sizing of the cache
internal discard bitset depends on it).
