linux/kernel.h: split *_MAX and *_MIN macros into <linux/limits.h>

<linux/kernel.h> tends to be cluttered because we often put various sort
of unrelated stuff in it.  So, we have split out a sensible chunk of
code into a separate header from time to time.

This commit splits out the *_MAX and *_MIN defines.

The standard header <limits.h> contains various MAX, MIN constants
including numerial limits.  [1]

I think it makes sense to move in-kernel MAX, MIN constants into
include/linux/limits.h.

We already have include/uapi/linux/limits.h to contain some user-space
constants.  I changed its include guard to _UAPI_LINUX_LIMITS_H.  This
change has no impact to the user-space because
scripts/headers_install.sh rips off the '_UAPI' prefix from the include
guards of exported headers.
