Revert "devlink: Add a generic wake_on_lan port parameter"

This reverts commit b639583f9e36d044ac1b13090ae812266992cbac.

As per discussion with Jakub Kicinski and Michal Kubecek,
this will be better addressed by soon-too-come ethtool netlink
API with additional indication that given configuration request
is supposed to be persisted.

Also, remove the parameter support from bnxt_en driver.
