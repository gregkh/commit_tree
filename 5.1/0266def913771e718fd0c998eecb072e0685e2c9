xen/balloon: Fix mapping PG_offline pages to user space

The XEN balloon driver - in contrast to other balloon drivers - allows
to map some inflated pages to user space. Such pages are allocated via
alloc_xenballooned_pages() and freed via free_xenballooned_pages().
The pfn space of these allocated pages is used to map other things
by the hypervisor using hypercalls.

Pages marked with PG_offline must never be mapped to user space (as
this page type uses the mapcount field of struct pages).

So what we can do is, clear/set PG_offline when allocating/freeing an
inflated pages. This way, most inflated pages can be excluded by
dumping tools and the "reused for other purpose" balloon pages are
correctly not marked as PG_offline.
