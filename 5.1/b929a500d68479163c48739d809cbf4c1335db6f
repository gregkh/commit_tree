x86/realmode: Don't leak the trampoline kernel address

Since commit

  ad67b74d2469 ("printk: hash addresses printed with %p")

at boot "____ptrval____" is printed instead of the trampoline addresses:

  Base memory trampoline at [(____ptrval____)] 99000 size 24576

Remove the print as we don't want to leak kernel addresses and this
statement is not needed anymore.

Fixes: ad67b74d2469d9b8 ("printk: hash addresses printed with %p")
