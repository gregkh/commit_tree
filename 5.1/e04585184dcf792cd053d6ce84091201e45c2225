usb: ehci-orion: avoid double PHY initialization

No need to initialize the PHY from the driver's probe. It is done by
the core automatically and doing it twice would increment the
phy->powercount counter to 2 instead of 1. During later suspend
operation, the counter will be decremented to one, no phy->power_off()
will occur and worse than that, the following phy->power_on() at
resume time will also be skipped, failing the whole S2RAM operation.
