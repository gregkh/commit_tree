LSM: Provide separate ordered initialization

This provides a place for ordered LSMs to be initialized, separate from
the "major" LSMs. This is mainly a copy/paste from major_lsm_init() to
ordered_lsm_init(), but it will change drastically in later patches.

What is not obvious in the patch is that this change moves the integrity
LSM from major_lsm_init() into ordered_lsm_init(), since it is not marked
with the LSM_FLAG_LEGACY_MAJOR. As it is the only LSM in the "ordered"
list, there is no reordering yet created.
