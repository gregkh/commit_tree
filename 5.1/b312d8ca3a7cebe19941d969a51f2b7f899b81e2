dma-buf: make fence sequence numbers 64 bit v2

For a lot of use cases we need 64bit sequence numbers. Currently drivers
overload the dma_fence structure to store the additional bits.

Stop doing that and make the sequence number in the dma_fence always
64bit.

For compatibility with hardware which can do only 32bit sequences the
comparisons in __dma_fence_is_later only takes the lower 32bits as significant
when the upper 32bits are all zero.

v2: change the logic in __dma_fence_is_later
