mmc: renesas_sdhi: Fix card initialization failure in high speed mode

This fixes card initialization failure in high speed mode.

If U-Boot uses SDR or HS200/400 mode before starting Linux and Linux
DT does not enable SDR/HS200/HS400 mode, card initialization fails in
high speed mode.

It is necessary to initialize SCC registers during card initialization
phase. HW reset function is registered only for a port with either of
SDR/HS200/HS400 properties in device tree. If SDR/HS200/HS400 properties
are not present in device tree, SCC registers will not be reset. In SoC
that support SCC registers, HW reset function should be registered
regardless of the configuration of device tree.

Reproduction procedure:
- Use U-Boot that support MMC HS200/400 mode.
- Delete HS200/HS400 properties in device tree.
  (Delete mmc-hs200-1_8v and mmc-hs400-1_8v)
- MMC port works high speed mode and all commands fail.
