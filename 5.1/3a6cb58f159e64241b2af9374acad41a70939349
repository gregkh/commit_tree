rcutorture: Add grace period after CPU offline

Beyond a certain point in the CPU-hotplug offline process, timers get
stranded on the outgoing CPU, and won't fire until that CPU comes back
online, which might well be never.  This commit therefore adds a hook
in torture_onoff_init() that is invoked from torture_offline(), which
rcutorture uses to occasionally wait for a grace period.  This should
result in failures for RCU implementations that rely on stranded timers
eventually firing in the absence of the CPU coming back online.
