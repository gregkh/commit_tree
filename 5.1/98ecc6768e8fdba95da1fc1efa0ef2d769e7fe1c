powerpc/32: Include .branch_lt in data section

When building a 32 bit powerpc kernel with Binutils 2.31.1 this warning
is emitted:

 powerpc-linux-gnu-ld: warning: orphan section `.branch_lt' from
 `arch/powerpc/kernel/head_44x.o' being placed in section `.branch_lt'

As of binutils commit 2d7ad24e8726 ("Support PLT16 relocs against local
symbols")[1], 32 bit targets can produce .branch_lt sections in their
output.

Include these symbols in the .data section as the ppc64 kernel does.
