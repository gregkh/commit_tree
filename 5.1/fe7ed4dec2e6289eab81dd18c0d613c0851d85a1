ASoC: simple-card: rename to asoc_simple_card_canonicalize_platform()

Current simple-card is using asoc_simple_card_canonicalize_dailink().
Its naming is "dailink", but is for "platform".
We already have asoc_simple_card_canonicalize_cpu() for "cpu",
let's follow same naming rule.
It never return error, so, void function is better idea.
