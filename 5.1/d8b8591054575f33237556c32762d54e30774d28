iommu/vt-d: Disable ATS support on untrusted devices

Commit fb58fdcd295b9 ("iommu/vt-d: Do not enable ATS for untrusted
devices") disables ATS support on the devices which have been marked
as untrusted. Unfortunately this is not enough to fix the DMA attack
vulnerabiltiies because IOMMU driver allows translated requests as
long as a device advertises the ATS capability. Hence a malicious
peripheral device could use this to bypass IOMMU.

This disables the ATS support on untrusted devices by clearing the
internal per-device ATS mark. As the result, IOMMU driver will block
any translated requests from any device marked as untrusted.
