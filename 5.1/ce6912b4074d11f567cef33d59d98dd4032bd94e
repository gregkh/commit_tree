drm/rockchip: check yuv2yuv existence before assigning window data

Before assigning window data, we should check if the yuv2yuv vop-data
is set at all, because it looks like it can otherwise reference something
wrong, as I saw on my rk3188 today which ended up in a null pointer
dereference in vop_plane_atomic_update when accessing the yuv2yuv data.
