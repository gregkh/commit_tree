drm/amd/display: fix CTS 4.2.2.8

[Why]
1-Test equipment does not reset test automation flag after completing
current test causing the next test to fail.
2.When test request is empty, we shouldn't ack the test.

[How]
1-Driver should always clear test equipment automation test request
when request is completed.
2-Driver should clear test equipement test automation if driver does
not complete the request.
