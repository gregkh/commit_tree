RDMA/rxe: Close a race after ib_register_device

Since rxe allows unregistration from other threads the rxe pointer can
become invalid any moment after ib_register_driver returns. This could
cause a user triggered use after free.

Add another driver callback to be called right after the device becomes
registered to complete any device setup required post-registration.  This
callback has enough core locking to prevent the device from becoming
unregistered.
