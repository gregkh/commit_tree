ice: add const qualifier to mac_addr parameter

The function ice_aq_manage_mac_write takes a pointer to a MAC address.
The parameter is not marked const, even though the function doesn't need
to modify it. This prevents passing a parameter that is already marked
const. Update the function prototype to take a const pointer, to allow
passing constant pointers to this function.
