livepatch: Module coming and going callbacks can proceed with all listed patches

Livepatches can no longer get enabled and disabled repeatedly.
The list klp_patches contains only enabled patches and eventually
the patch in transition.

The module coming and going callbacks do no longer need to check
for these state. They have to proceed with all listed patches.
