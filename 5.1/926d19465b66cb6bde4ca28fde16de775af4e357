bcache: export backing_dev_name via sysfs

This patch export dc->backing_dev_name to sysfs file
/sys/block/bcache<?>/bcache/backing_dev_name, then people or user space
tools may know the backing device name of this bcache device.

Of cause it can be done by parsing sysfs links, but this method can be
much simpler to find the link between bcache device and backing device.
