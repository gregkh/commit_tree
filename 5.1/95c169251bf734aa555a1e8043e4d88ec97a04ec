ipv6: invert flowlabel sharing check in process and user mode

A request for a flowlabel fails in process or user exclusive mode must
fail if the caller pid or uid does not match. Invert the test.

Previously, the test was unsafe wrt PID recycling, but indeed tested
for inequality: fl1->owner != fl->owner
