net: dsa: Implement flow_dissect callback for tag_dsa.

RPS not work for DSA devices since the 'skb_get_hash'
will always get the invalid hash for dsa tagged packets.

"[PATCH] tag_mtk: add flow_dissect callback to the ops struct"
introduced the flow_dissect callback to get the right hash for
MTK tagged packet. Tag_dsa and tag_edsa  also need to implement
the callback.
