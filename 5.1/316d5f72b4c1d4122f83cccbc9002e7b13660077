net/mlx5e: Always query offloaded tc peer rule counter

Under multipath when encap rules are duplicated to HW in the driver,
it's possible for one flow to be currently un-offloaded (e.g. lack of
next-hop route or neigh entry) while the other flow is offloaded. As
such, we move to query the counters of both flows at all times.
