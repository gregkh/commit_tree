MIPS: Export mm switching functions used by KVM

KVM makes use of check_switch_mmu_context(), check_mmu_context() &
get_new_mmu_context() which are no longer static inline functions in a
header. As such they need to be exported for KVM to successfully build
as a module, which was previously overlooked. Add the missing exports.
