media: v4l: uAPI: V4L2_BUF_TYPE_META_OUTPUT is an output buffer type

V4L2_BUF_TYPE_META_OUTPUT was added by commit 72148d1a57e7
("media: v4l: Add support for V4L2_BUF_TYPE_META_OUTPUT") but the patch
missed adding the type to the macro telling whether a given type is an
output type or not. Do that now. Getting this wrong leads to handling the
buffer as a capture buffer in a lot of places.

Fixes: 72148d1a57e7 ("media: v4l: Add support for V4L2_BUF_TYPE_META_OUTPUT")
