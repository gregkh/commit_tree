drm/i915/selftests: Refactor common live_test framework

Before adding yet another copy of struct live_test and its handler,
refactor the existing code into a common framework for live selftests.
For many live selftests, we want to know if the GPU hung or otherwise
misbehaved during the execution of the test (beyond any infraction in
the behaviour under test), live_test provides this by comparing the
GPU state before and after, alerting if it unexpectedly changed (e.g.
the reset counter changed). It also ensures that the GPU is idle before
and after the test, so that residual code running on the GPU is flushed
before testing.
