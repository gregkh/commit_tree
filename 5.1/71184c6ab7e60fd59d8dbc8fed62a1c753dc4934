perf record: Replace option --bpf-event with --no-bpf-event

Currently, monitoring of BPF programs through bpf_event is off by
default for 'perf record'.

To turn it on, the user need to use option "--bpf-event".  As BPF gets
wider adoption in different subsystems, this option becomes
inconvenient.

This patch makes bpf_event on by default, and adds option "--no-bpf-event"
to turn it off. Since option --bpf-event is not released yet, it is safe
to remove it.
