perf util: Use cached rbtree for rblists

At the cost of an extra pointer, we can avoid the O(logN) cost of
finding the first element in the tree (smallest node), which is
something required for any of the strlist or intlist traversals
(XXX_for_each_entry()). There are a number of users in perf of these
(particularly strlists), including probes, and buildid.
