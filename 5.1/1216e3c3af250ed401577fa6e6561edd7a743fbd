drm/i915: Drop unused engine->irq_seqno_barrier w/a

Now that we have eliminated the CPU-side irq_seqno_barrier by moving the
delays on the GPU before emitting the MI_USER_INTERRUPT, we can remove
the engine->irq_seqno_barrier infrastructure. Though intentionally
slowing down the GPU is nasty, so is the code we can now remove!
