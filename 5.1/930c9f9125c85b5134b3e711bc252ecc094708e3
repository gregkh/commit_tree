rxrpc: Fix client call connect/disconnect race

rxrpc_disconnect_client_call() reads the call's connection ID protocol
value (call->cid) as part of that function's variable declarations.  This
is bad because it's not inside the locked section and so may race with
someone granting use of the channel to the call.

This manifests as an assertion failure (see below) where the call in the
presumed channel (0 because call->cid wasn't set when we read it) doesn't
match the call attached to the channel we were actually granted (if 1, 2 or
3).

Fix this by moving the read and dependent calculations inside of the
channel_lock section.  Also, only set the channel number and pointer
variables if cid is not zero (ie. unset).

This problem can be induced by injecting an occasional error in
rxrpc_wait_for_channel() before the call to schedule().

Make two further changes also:

 (1) Add a trace for wait failure in rxrpc_connect_call().

 (2) Drop channel_lock before BUG'ing in the case of the assertion failure.

The failure causes a trace akin to the following:

rxrpc: Assertion failed - 18446612685268945920(0xffff8880beab8c00) == 18446612685268621312(0xffff8880bea69800) is false
