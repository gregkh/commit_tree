iwlwifi: fix driver operation for 5350

We introduced a bug that prevented this old device from
working. The driver would simply not be able to complete
the INIT flow while spewing this warning:

 CSR addresses aren't configured
 WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 819 at drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/pcie/drv.c:917
 iwl_pci_probe+0x160/0x1e0 [iwlwifi]
