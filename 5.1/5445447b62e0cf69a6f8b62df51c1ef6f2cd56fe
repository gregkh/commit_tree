vt: Implement parsing for >, =, < private sequences.

Private sequences can start with '>', '=' and (in theory) '<'.
Implement correct parsing for these. The newly parsable sequences are
cleanly ignored as it is customary with terminal emulators.

This allows the vt to ignore various sequences used by more capable
terminal implementations such as "Secondary Device Attributes",
"Tertiary Device Attributes" and various advanced configuration commands
that don't have dedicated terminfo entries.
