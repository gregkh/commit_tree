drm/i915: Account for minimum ddb allocation restrictions

On icl+ bspec tells us to calculate a separate minimum ddb
allocation from the blocks watermark. Both have to be checked
against the actual ddb allocation, but since we do things the
other way around we'll just calculat the minimum acceptable
ddb allocation by taking the maximum of the two values.

We'll also replace the memcmp() with a full trawl over the
the watermarks so that it'll ignore the min_ddb_alloc
because we can't directly read that out from the hw. I suppose
we could reconstruct it from the other values, but I was
too lazy to do that now.
