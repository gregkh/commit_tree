tools feature: Undef _GNU_SOURCE at the end of feature tests

Since we get all the tests in a single .c file for a first test,
tools/build/feature/test-all.c, if individual tests set that define and
fail to undef it at its end, then it the test-all.c build will fail due
to defining _GNU_SOURCE multiple times, getting us to the slow path,
so undef it at the end in tests that define it.
