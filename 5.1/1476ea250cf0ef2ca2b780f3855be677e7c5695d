unicore32: stop printing the virtual memory layout

Since commit ad67b74d2469 ("printk: hash addresses printed with %p"),
the virtual memory layout printed during boot up contains "ptrval"
instead of actual addresses.

Instead of changing the printing to "%px", and leaking virtual memory
layout information again, just remove the printing completely, cfr.
e.g.  commits 071929dbdd86 ("arm64: Stop printing the virtual memory
layout") and 31833332f798 ("m68k/mm: Stop printing the virtual memory
layout").

All interesting information (actual section sizes) is already printed by
mem_init_print_info() just above anyway.
