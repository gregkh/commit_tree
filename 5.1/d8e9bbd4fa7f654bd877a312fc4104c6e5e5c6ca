LSM: Split LSM preparation from initialization

Since we already have to do a pass through the LSMs to figure out if
exclusive LSMs should be disabled after the first one is seen as enabled,
this splits the logic up a bit more cleanly. Now we do a full "prepare"
pass through the LSMs (which also allows for later use by the blob-sharing
code), before starting the LSM initialization pass.
