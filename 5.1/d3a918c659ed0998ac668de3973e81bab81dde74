kbuild: remove cc-version macro

There is no more direct user of this macro; it is only used by
cc-ifversion.

Calling this macro is not efficient since it invokes the compiler to
get the compiler version. CONFIG_GCC_VERSION is already calculated in
the Kconfig stage, so Makefile can reuse it.

Here is a note about the slight difference between cc-version and
CONFIG_GCC_VERSION:

When using Clang, cc-version is evaluated to '0402' because Clang
defines __GNUC__ and __GNUC__MINOR__, and looks like GCC 4.2 in the
version point of view. On the other hand, CONFIG_GCC_VERSION=0
when $(CC) is clang.

There are currently two users of cc-ifversion:
  arch/mips/loongson64/Platform
  arch/powerpc/Makefile

They are not affected by this change.

The format of cc-version is <major><minor>, while CONFIG_GCC_VERSION
<major><minor><patch>. I adjusted cc-ifversion for the difference of
the number of digits.
