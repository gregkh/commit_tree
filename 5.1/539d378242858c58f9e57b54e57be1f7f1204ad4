irqchip/gicv3-its: Use NUMA aware memory allocation for ITS tables

The NUMA node information is visible to ITS driver but not being used
other than handling hardware errata. ITS/GICR hardware accesses to the
local NUMA node is usually quicker than the remote NUMA node. How slow
the remote NUMA accesses are depends on the implementation details.

This patch allocates memory for ITS management tables and command
queue from the corresponding NUMA node using the appropriate NUMA
aware functions. This change improves the performance of the ITS
tables read latency on systems where it has more than one ITS block,
and with the slower inter node accesses.

Apache Web server benchmarking using ab tool on a HiSilicon D06
board with multiple numa mem nodes shows Time per request and
Transfer rate improvements of ~3.6% with this patch.
