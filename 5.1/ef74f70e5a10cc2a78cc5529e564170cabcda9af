gpio: add irq domain activate/deactivate functions

This adds the two new functions gpiochip_irq_domain_activate and
gpiochip_irq_domain_deactivate that can be used as the activate and
deactivate functions in the struct irq_domain_ops. This is for
situations where only gpiochip_{lock,unlock}_as_irq needs to be called.
SPMI and SSBI GPIO are two users that will initially use these
functions.
