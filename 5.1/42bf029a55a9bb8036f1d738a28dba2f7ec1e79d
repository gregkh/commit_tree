ASoC: simple-card: don't select DPCM via simple-audio-card

commit da215354eb55c ("ASoC: simple-card: merge simple-scu-card")
merged simple-scu-audio-card which can handle DPCM into
simple-audio-card.

By this patch, the judgement to select "normal sound card" or
"DPCM sound card" is based on its CPU/Codec DAI count.
But, because of it, existing "simple-audio-card" user who is
assuming "normal sound card" might select DPCM unintentionally.

To solve this issue, this patch allows "simple-audio-card" user
can select "normal sound card", and "simple-scu-audio-card" user
can select both "normal sound card" and "DPCM sound card".
This keeps compatibility collectry.
