mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: fix HS400 timing issue

Now tuning reset will be done when the timing is MMC_TIMING_LEGACY/
MMC_TIMING_MMC_HS/MMC_TIMING_SD_HS. But for timing MMC_TIMING_MMC_HS,
we can not do tuning reset, otherwise HS400 timing is not right.

Here is the process of init HS400, first finish tuning in HS200 mode,
then switch to HS mode and 8 bit DDR mode, finally switch to HS400
mode. If we do tuning reset in HS mode, this will cause HS400 mode
lost the tuning setting, which will cause CRC error.
