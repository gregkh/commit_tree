bpf: add plumbing for BPF_LWT_ENCAP_IP in bpf_lwt_push_encap

This patch adds all needed plumbing in preparation to allowing
bpf programs to do IP encapping via bpf_lwt_push_encap. Actual
implementation is added in the next patch in the patchset.

Of note:
- bpf_lwt_push_encap can now be called from BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_XMIT
  prog types in addition to BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_IN;
- if the skb being encapped has GSO set, encapsulation is limited
  to IPIP/IP+GRE/IP+GUE (both IPv4 and IPv6);
- as route lookups are different for ingress vs egress, the single
  external bpf_lwt_push_encap BPF helper is routed internally to
  either bpf_lwt_in_push_encap or bpf_lwt_xmit_push_encap BPF_CALLs,
  depending on prog type.

v8 changes: fixed a typo.
