x86/kprobes: Avoid kretprobe recursion bug

Avoid kretprobe recursion loop bg by setting a dummy
kprobes to current_kprobe per-CPU variable.

This bug has been introduced with the asm-coded trampoline
code, since previously it used another kprobe for hooking
the function return placeholder (which only has a nop) and
trampoline handler was called from that kprobe.

This revives the old lost kprobe again.

With this fix, we don't see deadlock anymore.

And you can see that all inner-called kretprobe are skipped.

  event_1                                  235               0
  event_2                                19375           19612

The 1st column is recorded count and the 2nd is missed count.
Above shows (event_1 rec) + (event_2 rec) ~= (event_2 missed)
(some difference are here because the counter is racy)
