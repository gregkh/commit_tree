iwlwifi: Fix pre operational dumping flows

There are several dumping flows in the driver in case of a fail
prior to operational.

In some cases we get 2 dumps while in others we get none.

Fix this by uniting the different flows.
Add a different dump type to driver triggered dumps in case we want
a dump but did not got assert, and make all dumping go through
iwl_fw_dbg_collect_desc to avoid multiple dumps.
