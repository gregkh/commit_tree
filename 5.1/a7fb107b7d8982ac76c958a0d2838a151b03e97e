net: phy: Re-parent menus for MDIO bus drivers correctly

After 90eff9096c01 ("net: phy: Allow splitting MDIO bus/device support
from PHYs") the various MDIO bus drivers were no longer parented with
config PHYLIB but with config MDIO_BUS which is not a menuconfig, fix
this by depending on MDIO_DEVICE which is a menuconfig.

This is visually nicer and less confusing for users.
