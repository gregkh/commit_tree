block, bfq: port commit "cfq-iosched: improve hw_tag detection"

The original commit is commit 1a1238a7dd48 ("cfq-iosched: improve hw_tag
detection") and has the following commit message:

If active queue hasn't enough requests and idle window opens, cfq will
not dispatch sufficient requests to hardware. In such situation, current
code will zero hw_tag. But this is because cfq doesn't dispatch enough
requests instead of hardware queue doesn't work. Don't zero hw_tag in
such case.
