iio: cros_ec: Fix the maths for gyro scale calculation

Calculation did not use IIO_DEGREE_TO_RAD and implemented a variant to
avoid precision loss as we aim a nano value. The offset added to avoid
rounding error, though, doesn't give us a close result to the expected
value. E.g.

For 1000dps, the result should be:

    (1000 * pi ) / 180 >> 15 ~= 0.000532632218

But with current calculation we get

    $ cat scale
    0.000547890

Fix the calculation by just doing the maths involved for a nano value

   val * pi * 10e12 / (180 * 2^15)

so we get a closer result.

    $ cat scale
    0.000532632
