x86/boot: Disable RSDP parsing temporarily

The original intention to move RDSP parsing very early, before KASLR
does its ranges selection, was to accommodate movable memory regions
machines (CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE) to still be able to do memory
hotplug.

However, that broke kexec'ing a kernel on EFI machines because depending
on where the EFI systab was mapped, on at least one machine it isn't
present in the kexec mapping of the second kernel, leading to a triple
fault in the early code.

Fixing this properly requires significantly involved surgery and we
cannot allow ourselves to do that, that close to the merge window.

So disable the RSDP parsing code temporarily until it is fixed properly
in the next release cycle.
