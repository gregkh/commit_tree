KVM: PPC: Remove -I. header search paths

The header search path -I. in kernel Makefiles is very suspicious;
it allows the compiler to search for headers in the top of $(srctree),
where obviously no header file exists.

Commit 46f43c6ee022 ("KVM: powerpc: convert marker probes to event
trace") first added these options, but they are completely useless.
