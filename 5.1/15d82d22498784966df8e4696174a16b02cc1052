rtc: sh: Fix invalid alarm warning for non-enabled alarm

When no alarm has been programmed on RSK-RZA1, an error message is
printed during boot:

    rtc rtc0: invalid alarm value: 2019-03-14T255:255:255

sh_rtc_read_alarm_value() returns 0xff when querying a hardware alarm
field that is not enabled.  __rtc_read_alarm() validates the received
alarm values, and fills in missing fields when needed.
While 0xff is handled fine for the year, month, and day fields, and
corrected as considered being out-of-range, this is not the case for the
hour, minute, and second fields, where -1 is expected for missing
fields.

Fix this by returning -1 instead, as this value is handled fine for all
fields.
