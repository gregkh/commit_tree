afs: Use fs_context to pass parameters over automount

Alter the AFS automounting code to create and modify an fs_context struct
when parameterising a new mount triggered by an AFS mountpoint rather than
constructing device name and option strings.

Also remove the cell=, vol= and rwpath options as they are then redundant.
The reason they existed is because the 'device name' may be derived
literally from a mountpoint object in the filesystem, so default cell and
parent-type information needed to be passed in by some other method from
the automount routines.  The vol= option didn't end up being used.
