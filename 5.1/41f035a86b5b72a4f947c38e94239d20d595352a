x86/mce: Improve error message when kernel cannot recover, p2

In

  c7d606f560e4 ("x86/mce: Improve error message when kernel cannot recover")

a case was added for a machine check caused by a DATA access to poison
memory from the kernel. A case should have been added also for an
uncorrectable error during an instruction fetch in the kernel.

Add that extra case so the error message now reads:

  mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check: Instruction fetch error in kernel
