crypto: x86/aegis - fix handling chunked inputs and MAY_SLEEP

The x86 AEGIS implementations all fail the improved AEAD tests because
they produce the wrong result with some data layouts.  The issue is that
they assume that if the skcipher_walk API gives 'nbytes' not aligned to
the walksize (a.k.a. walk.stride), then it is the end of the data.  In
fact, this can happen before the end.

Also, when the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_SLEEP flag is given, they can
incorrectly sleep in the skcipher_walk_*() functions while preemption
has been disabled by kernel_fpu_begin().

Fix these bugs.
