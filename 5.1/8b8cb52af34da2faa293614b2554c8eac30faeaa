bus: imx-weim: support multiple address ranges per child node

Ensure that timing values for the child node are applied to
all chip selects in the child's address ranges.

Note that this does not support multiple timing settings per
child; this can be added in the future if required.

Example:
&weim {
	acme@0 {
		compatible = "acme,whatever";
		reg = <0 0 0x100>, <0 0x400000 0x800>,
				<1 0x400000 0x800>;
		fsl,weim-cs-timing = <0x024400b1 0x00001010 0x20081100
				0x00000000 0xa0000240 0x00000000>;
	};
};
