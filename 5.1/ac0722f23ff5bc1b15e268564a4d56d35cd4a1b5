dt-bindings: cpu: Fix JSON schema

Commit fd73403a4862 ("dt-bindings: arm: Add SMP enable-method for
Milbeaut") added support for a new cpu enable-method, but did so using
tabulations to ident. This is however invalid in the syntax, and resulted
in a failure when trying to use that schemas for validation.

Use spaces instead of tabs to indent to fix this.
