devlink: Update reporter state to error even if recover aborted

If devlink_health_report() aborted the recover flow due to grace period checker,
it left the reporter status as DEVLINK_HEALTH_REPORTER_STATE_HEALTHY, which is
a bug. Fix that by always setting the reporter state to
DEVLINK_HEALTH_REPORTER_STATE_ERROR prior to running the checker mentioned above.

In addition, save the previous health_state in a temporary variable, then use
it in the abort check comparison instead of using reporter->health_state which
might be already changed.
