pptp: dst_release sk_dst_cache in pptp_sock_destruct

sk_setup_caps() is called to set sk->sk_dst_cache in pptp_connect,
so we have to dst_release(sk->sk_dst_cache) in pptp_sock_destruct,
otherwise, the dst refcnt will leak.

It can be reproduced by this syz log:

  r1 = socket$pptp(0x18, 0x1, 0x2)
  bind$pptp(r1, &(0x7f0000000100)={0x18, 0x2, {0x0, @local}}, 0x1e)
  connect$pptp(r1, &(0x7f0000000000)={0x18, 0x2, {0x3, @remote}}, 0x1e)

Consecutive dmesg warnings will occur:

  unregister_netdevice: waiting for lo to become free. Usage count = 1

v1->v2:
  - use rcu_dereference_protected() instead of rcu_dereference_check(),
    as suggested by Eric.
