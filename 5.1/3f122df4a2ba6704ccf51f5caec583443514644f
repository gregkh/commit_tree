media: vivid: do not implement VIDIOC_S_PARM for output streams

v4l2_compliance gave a warning for the S_PARM test for output streams:

warn: v4l2-test-formats.cpp(1235): S_PARM is supported for buftype 2, but not for ENUM_FRAMEINTERVALS

The reason is that vivid mapped s_parm for output streams to g_parm. But if
S_PARM doesn't actually change anything, then it shouldn't be enabled at all.
