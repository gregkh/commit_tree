Revert "KVM: MMU: collapse TLB flushes when zap all pages"

Unwinding optimizations related to obsolete pages is a step towards
removing x86 KVM's fast invalidate mechanism, i.e. this is one part of
a revert all patches from the series that introduced the mechanism[1].

This reverts commit f34d251d66ba263c077ed9d2bbd1874339a4c887.
