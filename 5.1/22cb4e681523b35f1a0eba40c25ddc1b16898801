mtip32xx: Ñ•top abusing the managed resource APIs

The mtip32xx driver uses managed resources for DMA coherent memory
and irqs, but then always pairs them with free calls anyway, making
the resource tracking rather pointless.  Given some DMA allocations
are transient anyway, the irq freeing seems to require ordering vs
other hardware access the best solution seems to be to stop using
the managed resource API entirely.
