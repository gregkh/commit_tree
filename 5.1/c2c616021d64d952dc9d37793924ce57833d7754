ASoC: audio-graph-card: don't select DPCM via audio-graph-card

commit ae3cb5790906b ("ASoC: audio-graph-card: merge
audio-graph-scu-card") merged audio-graph-scu-card which can
handle DPCM into audio-graph-card.

By this patch, the judgement to select "normal sound card" or
"DPCM sound card" is based on its OF-graph endpoint connection.
But, because of it, existing "audio-graph-card" user who is
assuming "normal sound card" might select DPCM unintentionally.

To solve this issue, this patch allows "audio-graph-card" user
can select "normal sound card", and "audio-graph-scu-card" user
can select both "normal sound card" and "DPCM sound card".
This keeps compatibility collectry.
