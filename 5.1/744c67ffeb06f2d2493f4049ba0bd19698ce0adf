ALSA: hda - Don't trigger jackpoll_work in azx_resume

The commit 3baffc4a84d7 (ALSA: hda/intel: Refactoring PM code) changed
the behaviour of azx_resume(), it triggers the jackpoll_work after
applying this commit.

This change introduced a new issue, all codecs are runtime active
after S3, and will not call runtime_suspend() automatically.

The root cause is the jackpoll_work calls snd_hda_power_up/down_pm,
and it calls up_pm before snd_hdac_enter_pm is called, while calls
the down_pm in the middle of enter_pm and leave_pm is called. This
makes the dev->power.usage_count unbalanced after S3.

To fix it, let azx_resume() don't trigger jackpoll_work as before
it did.
