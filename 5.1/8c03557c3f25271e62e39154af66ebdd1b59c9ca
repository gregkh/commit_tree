selftests/net: correct the return value for run_afpackettests

The run_afpackettests will be marked as passed regardless the return
value of those sub-tests in the script:
    --------------------
    running psock_tpacket test
    --------------------
    [FAIL]
    selftests: run_afpackettests [PASS]

Fix this by changing the return value for each tests.
