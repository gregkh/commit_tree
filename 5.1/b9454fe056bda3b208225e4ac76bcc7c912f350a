xfs: clean up the inode cluster checking in the inobt scrub

The code to check inobt records against inode clusters is a mess of
poorly named variables and unnecessary parameters.  Clean the
unnecessary inode number parameters out of _check_cluster_freemask in
favor of computing them inside the function instead of making the caller
do it.  In xchk_iallocbt_check_cluster, rename the variables to make it
more obvious just what chunk_ino and cluster_ino represent.

Add a tracepoint to make it easier to track each inode cluster as we
scrub it.
