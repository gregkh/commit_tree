net/mlx5: Consolidate update FTE for all removal changes

With commit a18e879d4e45 ("net/mlx5e: Annul encap action ordering
requirement") and a use-case of e-switch remote mirroring, the
incremental/stepped FTE removal process done by the fs core got us to
illegal transient states and FW errors:

SET_FLOW_TABLE_ENTRY(0x936) op_mod(0x0) failed, status bad
parameter(0x3), syndrome (0x9c2e40)

To avoid that and improve FTE removal performance, aggregate the FTE's
updates that should be applied. Remove the FTE if it is empty, or apply
one FW update command with the aggregated updates.
