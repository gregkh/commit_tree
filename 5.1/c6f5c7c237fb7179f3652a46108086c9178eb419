media: dvb-core: fix epoll() by calling poll_wait first

The epoll function expects that whenever the poll file op is
called, the poll_wait function is also called. That didn't
always happen in dvb_demux_poll(), dvb_dvr_poll() and
dvb_ca_en50221_io_poll(). Fix this, otherwise epoll()
can timeout when it shouldn't.
