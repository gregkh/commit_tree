mips: loongson64: lemote-2f: Add IRQF_NO_SUSPEND to "cascade" irqaction.

Timekeeping IRQs from CS5536 MFGPT are routed to i8259, which then
triggers the "cascade" IRQ on MIPS CPU. Without IRQF_NO_SUSPEND in
cascade_irqaction, MFGPT interrupts will be masked in suspend mode,
and the machine would be unable to resume once suspended.

Previously, MIPS IRQs were not disabled properly, so the original
code appeared to work. Commit a3e6c1eff5 ("MIPS: IRQ: Fix disable_irq on
CPU IRQs") uncovers the bug. To fix it, add IRQF_NO_SUSPEND to
cascade_irqaction.

This commit is functionally identical to 0add9c2f1cff ("MIPS:
Loongson-3: Add IRQF_NO_SUSPEND to Cascade irqaction"), but it forgot
to apply the same fix to Loongson2.
