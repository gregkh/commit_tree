tpm: encapsulate tpm_dev_transmit()

Encapsulate tpm_transmit() call pattern to tpm_dev_transmit() because it
is identically used from two places. Use unlocked version of
tpm_transmit() so that we are able to move the calls to
tpm2_prepare_space() and tpm2_commit_space() later on to this new
function.
