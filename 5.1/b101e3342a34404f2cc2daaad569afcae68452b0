xfs: simplify the xfs_bmap_btree_to_extents calling conventions

Move boilerplate code from the callers into xfs_bmap_btree_to_extents:

 - exit early without failure if we don't need to convert to the
   extent format
 - assert that we have a btree cursor
 - don't reinitialize the passed in logflags argument
