arm64/mm: enable HugeTLB migration for contiguous bit HugeTLB pages

Let arm64 subscribe to the previously added framework in which
architecture can inform whether a given huge page size is supported for
migration.  This just overrides the default function
arch_hugetlb_migration_supported() and enables migration for all
possible HugeTLB page sizes on arm64.

With this, HugeTLB migration support on arm64 now covers all possible
HugeTLB options.
