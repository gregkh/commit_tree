blk-mq: save queue mapping result into ctx directly

Currently, the queue mapping result is saved in a two-dimensional
array. In the hot path, to get a hctx, we need do following:

  q->queue_hw_ctx[q->tag_set->map[type].mq_map[cpu]]

This isn't very efficient. We could save the queue mapping result into
ctx directly with different hctx type, like,

  ctx->hctxs[type]
