ath9k: Make sure to zero status.tx_time before reporting TX status

Since ath9k reports airtime usage directly using the
ieee80211_report_airtime() callback, it shouldn't also report it using the
tx_time in status. Make sure the field is zeroed before TX status is
reported to avoid spurious airtime being accounted by bits being left over
from earlier uses of the cb.
