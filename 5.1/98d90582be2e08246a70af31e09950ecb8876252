svm: Fix AVIC DFR and LDR handling

Current SVM AVIC driver makes two incorrect assumptions:
  1. APIC LDR register cannot be zero
  2. APIC DFR for all vCPUs must be the same

LDR=0 means the local APIC does not support logical destination mode.
Therefore, the driver should mark any previously assigned logical APIC ID
table entry as invalid, and return success.  Also, DFR is specific to
a particular local APIC, and can be different among all vCPUs
(as observed on Windows 10).

These incorrect assumptions cause Windows 10 and FreeBSD VMs to fail
to boot with AVIC enabled. So, instead of flush the whole logical APIC ID
table, handle DFR and LDR for each vCPU independently.
