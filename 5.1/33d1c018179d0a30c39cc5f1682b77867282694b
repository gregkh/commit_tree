netfilter: nf_tables: prevent shift wrap in nft_chain_parse_hook()

I believe that "hook->num" can be up to UINT_MAX.  Shifting more than
31 bits would is undefined in C but in practice it would lead to shift
wrapping.  That would lead to an array overflow in nf_tables_addchain():

	ops->hook       = hook.type->hooks[ops->hooknum];
