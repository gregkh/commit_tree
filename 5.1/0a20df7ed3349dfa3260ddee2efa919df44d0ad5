fsnotify: report FS_ISDIR flag with MOVE_SELF and DELETE_SELF events

We need to report FS_ISDIR flag with MOVE_SELF and DELETE_SELF events
for fanotify, because fanotify API requires the user to explicitly
request events on directories by FAN_ONDIR flag.

inotify never reported IN_ISDIR with those events. It looks like an
oversight, but to avoid the risk of breaking existing inotify programs,
mask the FS_ISDIR flag out when reprting those events to inotify backend.

We also add the FS_ISDIR flag with FS_ATTRIB event in the case of rename
over an empty target directory. inotify did not report IN_ISDIR in this
case, but it normally does report IN_ISDIR along with IN_ATTRIB event,
so in this case, we do not mask out the FS_ISDIR flag.
