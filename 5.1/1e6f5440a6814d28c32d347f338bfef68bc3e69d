arm64: backtrace: Don't bother trying to unwind the userspace stack

Calling dump_backtrace() with a pt_regs argument corresponding to
userspace doesn't make any sense and our unwinder will simply print
"Call trace:" before unwinding the stack looking for user frames.

Rather than go through this song and dance, just return early if we're
passed a user register state.
