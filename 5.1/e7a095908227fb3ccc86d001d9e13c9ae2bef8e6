arm64: dts: rockchip: Add devicetree for NanoPC-T4

This adds a device tree for the NanoPC-T4 SBC, which is based on the
Rockchip RK3399 SoC and marketed by FriendlyELEC.

Known working:

- Serial
- Ethernet
- HDMI
- USB 2.0

All of the interesting stuff is in a .dtsi because there are at least
two other boards that share most of it: NanoPi M4 and NanoPi NEO4.
