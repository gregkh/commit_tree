iio: adc: add STMPE ADC driver using IIO framework

This adds an ADC driver for the STMPE device using the industrial
input/output interface. The driver supports raw reading of values.
The driver depends on the MFD STMPE driver. If the touchscreen
block is enabled too, only four of the 8 ADC channels are available.
