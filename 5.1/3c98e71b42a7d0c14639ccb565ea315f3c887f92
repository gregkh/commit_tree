x86/boot: Add "acpi_rsdp=" early parsing

KASLR may randomly choose offsets which are located in movable memory
regions resulting in the movable memory becoming immovable.

The ACPI SRAT (System/Static Resource Affinity Table) describes memory
ranges including ranges of memory provided by hot-added memory devices.
In order to access SRAT, one needs the Root System Description Pointer
(RSDP) with which to find the Root/Extended System Description Table
(R/XSDT) which then contains the system description tables of which SRAT
is one of.

In case the RSDP address has been passed on the command line (kexec-ing
a second kernel) parse it from there.
