crypto: testmgr - mark crc32 checksum as FIPS allowed

The CRC32 is not a cryptographic hash algorithm,
so the FIPS restrictions should not apply to it.
(The CRC32C variant is already allowed.)

This CRC32 variant is used for in dm-crypt legacy TrueCrypt
IV implementation (tcw); detected by cryptsetup test suite
failure in FIPS mode.
