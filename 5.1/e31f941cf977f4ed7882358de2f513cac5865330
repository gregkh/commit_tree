MAINTAINERS: update list of qcom drivers

Several drivers didn't have a specific maintainer (other than the
subsystem maintainer). Add some generic regex patterns to capture most
qcom drivers in the list of supported drivers. For the rest, add
explicit filenames.

Sort the entries, while we're at it.
