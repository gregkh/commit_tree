net/mlx5e: Fix access to non-existing receive queue

In case number of channels is changed while interface is down,
RSS indirection table is mistakenly not modified accordingly,
causing access to out-of-range non-existing object.

Fix by updating the RSS indireciton table also in the early
return flow of interface down.
