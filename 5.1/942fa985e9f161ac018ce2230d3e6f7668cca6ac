32-bit userspace ABI: introduce ARCH_32BIT_OFF_T config option

All new 32-bit architectures should have 64-bit userspace off_t type, but
existing architectures has 32-bit ones.

To enforce the rule, new config option is added to arch/Kconfig that defaults
ARCH_32BIT_OFF_T to be disabled for new 32-bit architectures. All existing
32-bit architectures enable it explicitly.

New option affects force_o_largefile() behaviour. Namely, if userspace
off_t is 64-bits long, we have no reason to reject user to open big files.

Note that even if architectures has only 64-bit off_t in the kernel
(arc, c6x, h8300, hexagon, nios2, openrisc, and unicore32),
a libc may use 32-bit off_t, and therefore want to limit the file size
to 4GB unless specified differently in the open flags.
