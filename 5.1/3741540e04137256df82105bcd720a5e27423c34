drm/sched: Rework HW fence processing.

Expedite job deletion from ring mirror list to the HW fence signal
callback instead from finish_work, together with waiting for all
such fences to signal in drm_sched_stop we garantee that
already signaled job will not be processed twice.
Remove the sched finish fence callback and just submit finish_work
directly from the HW fence callback.

v2: Fix comments.
v3: Attach  hw fence cb to sched_job
v5: Rebase
