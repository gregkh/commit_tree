s390/virtio: handle find on invalid queue gracefully

A queue with a capacity of zero is clearly not a valid virtio queue.
Some emulators report zero queue size if queried with an invalid queue
index. Instead of crashing in this case let us just return -ENOENT. To
make that work properly, let us fix the notifier cleanup logic as well.
