bnxt_re: fix the regression due to changes in alloc_pbl

While adding the use of for_each_sg_dma_page iterator for Brodcom's rdma
driver, there was a regression added in the __alloc_pbl path. The change
left bnxt_re in DOA state in for-next branch.

Fixing the regression to avoid the host crash when a user space object is
created. Restricting the unconditional access to hwq.pg_arr when hwq is
initialized for user space objects.
