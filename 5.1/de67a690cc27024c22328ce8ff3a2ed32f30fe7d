net: hns3: only support tc 0 for VF

When the VF shares the same TC config as PF, the business
running on PF and VF must have samiliar module.

For simplicity, we are not considering VF sharing the same tc
configuration as PF use case, so this patch removes the support
of TC configuration from VF and forcing VF to just use single
TC.
