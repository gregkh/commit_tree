net/mlx5: Update enable HCA dependency

With the introduction of ECPF, we require that the ECPF driver will
aways call enable/disable HCA for that PF in the same way a PF does
this for its VFs. The PF is still responsible for calling enable and
disable HCA for its VFs.

To distinguish between the ECPF executing enable/disable HCA for
itself or for the PF, it sets the embedded CPU function bit in the
input params struct of these commands. When the bit is cleared and
function ID is zero, it refers to the peer PF.
