tpm: Fix off-by-one when reading binary_bios_measurements

It is unable to read the entry when it is the only one in
binary_bios_measurements:

00000000  00 00 00 00 08 00 00 00  c4 2f ed ad 26 82 00 cb
00000010  1d 15 f9 78 41 c3 44 e7  9d ae 33 20 00 00 00 00
00000020

This is obviously a firmware problem on my linux machine:

	Manufacturer: Inspur
	Product Name: SA5212M4
	Version: 01

However, binary_bios_measurements should return it any way,
rather than nothing, after all its content is completely
valid.
