KVM: SVM: Workaround errata#1096 (insn_len maybe zero on SMAP violation)

Errata#1096:

On a nested data page fault when CR.SMAP=1 and the guest data read
generates a SMAP violation, GuestInstrBytes field of the VMCB on a
VMEXIT will incorrectly return 0h instead the correct guest
instruction bytes .

Recommend Workaround:

To determine what instruction the guest was executing the hypervisor
will have to decode the instruction at the instruction pointer.

The recommended workaround can not be implemented for the SEV
guest because guest memory is encrypted with the guest specific key,
and instruction decoder will not be able to decode the instruction
bytes. If we hit this errata in the SEV guest then log the message
and request a guest shutdown.
