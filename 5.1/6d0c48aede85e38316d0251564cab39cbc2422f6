block: implement bio helper to add iter bvec pages to bio

For an ITER_BVEC, we can just iterate the iov and add the pages
to the bio directly. For now, we grab a reference to those pages,
and release them normally on IO completion. This isn't really needed
for the normal case of O_DIRECT from/to a file, but some of the more
esoteric use cases (like splice(2)) will unconditionally put the
pipe buffer pages when the buffers are released. Until we can manage
that case properly, ITER_BVEC pages are treated like normal pages
in terms of reference counting.
