mt76x02u: check chip version on probe

Since some USB device IDs are duplicated between mt76x0u, mt7601u
and mt76x2u device, check chip version on probe and return error if
not match the driver.

Don't think this is serious issue, probe most likely will fail at
some other point for wrong device, but we do not have to configure
it if we know is not our device.
