net/mlx5: Refactor queries to speed fields in Port Type and Speed register

This patch fascicles queries to speed related fields in Port Type and
Speed register (PTYS) into a single API. I addition, this patch
refactors functions which serves only Ethernet driver: remove the
protocol type as an input parameter, move code from 'core' directory
into 'en' directory and add 'eth' prefix to the function's name. The
patch also encapsulates functions that are not used outside the Ethernet
driver removes redundant include files.
