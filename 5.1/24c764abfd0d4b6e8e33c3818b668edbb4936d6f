auxdisplay: deconfuse configuration

The auxdisplay Kconfig is confusing.  It creates two separate menus
even though the settings are closely related.  Moreover, the options
for setting the boot message depend on CONFIG_PARPORT even though they
are used by drivers that do not.

Clear up the confusion by moving the "Parallel port LCD/Keypad" menu
under auxdisplay where it logically belongs.  Change the boot message
options to depend only on CONFIG_CHARLCD, making them accessible also
when only the HD44780 is selected.

Since the "Parallel port LCD/Keypad" driver now has a new dependency
on CONFIG_AUXDISPLAY, rename its Kconfig symbol and keep the old one
such that make oldconfig will not disable the driver.
