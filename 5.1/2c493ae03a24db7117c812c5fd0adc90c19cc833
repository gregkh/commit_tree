net/mlx5e: Re-add support for TX timeout when TX reporter is not valid

When TX reporter was introduced, it took ownership over TX timeout error
handling. this introduced a regression in case TX reporter is not valid
(NET_DEVLINK is not set, or devlink_health_reporter_create failure).

Fix mlx5e_tx_reporter_timeout function so it can be called at all times.

In addition, remove a warning print that indicates that a TX timeout won't
be handled in case of no valid TX reporter.
