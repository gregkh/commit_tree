netfilter: never get/set skb->tstamp

setting net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_timestamp=1 breaks xmit with fq
scheduler.  skb->tstamp might be "refreshed" using ktime_get_real(),
but fq expects CLOCK_MONOTONIC.

This patch removes all places in netfilter that check/set skb->tstamp:

1. To fix the bogus "start" time seen with conntrack timestamping for
   outgoing packets, never use skb->tstamp and always use current time.
2. In nfqueue and nflog, only use skb->tstamp for incoming packets,
   as determined by current hook (prerouting, input, forward).
3. xt_time has to use system clock as well rather than skb->tstamp.
   We could still use skb->tstamp for prerouting/input/foward, but
   I see no advantage to make this conditional.
