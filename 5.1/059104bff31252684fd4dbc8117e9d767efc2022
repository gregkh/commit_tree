ath10k: add support to configure ftm responder role

Configure fine timing measurement (FTM) responder role from the
ftm_responder bss param sent by mac80211. With FTM functionality offloaded
to firmware, adding the interface allows userspace to enable or disable
FTM responder functionality. ath10k disables it at the time of interface
creation.

Supported FW: 10.4

Tested on IPQ4019 with firmware: 10.4-3.2.1.1-00022
