perf intel-pt: Fix CYC timestamp calculation after OVF

CYC packet timestamp calculation depends upon CBR which was being
cleared upon overflow (OVF). That can cause errors due to failing to
synchronize with sideband events. Even if a CBR change has been lost,
the old CBR is still a better estimate than zero. So remove the clearing
of CBR.
