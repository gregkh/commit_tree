habanalabs: add event queue and interrupts

This patch adds support for receiving events from Goya's control CPU and
for receiving MSI-X interrupts from Goya's DMA engines and CPU.

Goya's PCI controller supports up to 8 MSI-X interrupts, which only 6 of
them are currently used. The first 5 interrupts are dedicated for Goya's
DMA engine queues. The 6th interrupt is dedicated for Goya's control CPU.

The DMA queue will signal its MSI-X entry upon each completion of a command
buffer that was placed on its primary queue. The driver will then mark that
CB as completed and free the related resources. It will also update the
command submission object which that CB belongs to.

There is a dedicated event queue (EQ) between the driver and Goya's control
CPU. The EQ is located on the Host memory. The control CPU writes a new
entry to the EQ for various reasons, such as ECC error, MMU page fault, Hot
temperature. After writing the new entry to the EQ, the control CPU will
trigger its dedicated MSI-X entry to signal the driver that there is a new
entry in the EQ. The driver will then read the entry and act accordingly.
