x86/reboot, efi: Use EFI reboot for Acer TravelMate X514-51T

Upon reboot, the Acer TravelMate X514-51T laptop appears to complete the
shutdown process, but then it hangs in BIOS POST with a black screen.

The problem is intermittent - at some points it has appeared related to
Secure Boot settings or different kernel builds, but ultimately we have
not been able to identify the exact conditions that trigger the issue to
come and go.

Besides, the EFI mode cannot be disabled in the BIOS of this model.

However, after extensive testing, we observe that using the EFI reboot
method reliably avoids the issue in all cases.

So add a boot time quirk to use EFI reboot on such systems.
