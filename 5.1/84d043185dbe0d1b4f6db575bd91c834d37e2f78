spi: Add a driver for the Freescale/NXP QuadSPI controller

This driver is derived from the SPI NOR driver at
mtd/spi-nor/fsl-quadspi.c. It uses the new SPI memory interface
of the SPI framework to issue flash memory operations to up to
four connected flash chips (2 buses with 2 CS each).

The controller does not support generic SPI messages.

This patch also disables the build of the "old" driver and reuses
its Kconfig option CONFIG_SPI_FSL_QUADSPI to replace it.
