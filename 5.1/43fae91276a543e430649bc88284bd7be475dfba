RDMA/i40iw: Use for_each_sg_dma_page iterator on umem SGL

Use the for_each_sg_dma_page iterator variant to walk the umem DMA-mapped
SGL and get the page DMA address. This avoids the extra loop to iterate
pages in the SGE when for_each_sg iterator is used.

Additionally, purge umem->page_shift usage in the driver as its only
relevant for ODP MRs. Use system page size and shift instead.
