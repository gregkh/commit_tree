btrfs: merge btrfs_find_device_missing_or_by_path() into parent

btrfs_find_device_missing_or_by_path() is relatively small function, and
its only parent btrfs_find_device_by_devspec() is small as well. Besides
there are a number of find_device functions. Merge
btrfs_find_device_missing_or_by_path() into its parent.
