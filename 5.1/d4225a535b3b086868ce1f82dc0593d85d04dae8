drm/i915: Syntatic sugar for using intel_runtime_pm

Frequently, we use intel_runtime_pm_get/_put around a small block.
Formalise that usage by providing a macro to define such a block with an
automatic closure to scope the intel_runtime_pm wakeref to that block,
i.e. macro abuse smelling of python.
