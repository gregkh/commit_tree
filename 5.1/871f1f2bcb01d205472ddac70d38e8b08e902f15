platform/x86: intel_int0002_vgpio: Only implement irq_set_wake on Bay Trail

Commit c3b8e884defa ("platform/x86: intel_int0002_vgpio: Implement irq_set_wake"),
was written to fix some wakeup issues on Bay Trail (BYT) devices.

We've received a bug report that this causes a suspend regression on some
Cherry Trail (CHT) based devices.

To fix the issues this causes on CHT devices, this commit modifies the
irq_set_wake support so that we only implement irq_set_wake on BYT devices,
