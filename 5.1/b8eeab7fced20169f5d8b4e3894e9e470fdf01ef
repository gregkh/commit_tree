btrfs: Consolidate retval checking of core btree functions

Core btree functions in btrfs generally return 0 when an item is found,
1 in case the sought item cannot be found and <0 when an error happens.
Consolidate the checks for those conditions in one 'if () {} else if ()
{}' construct rather than 2 separate 'if () {}' statements. This
emphasizes that the handling code pertains to a single function. No
functional changes.
