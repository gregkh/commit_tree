ARCv2: lib: introduce memcpy optimized for unaligned access

Optimise code to use efficient unaligned memory access which is
available on ARCv2. This allows us to really simplify memcpy code
and speed up the code one and a half times (in case of unaligned
source or destination).

Don't wire it up yet !
