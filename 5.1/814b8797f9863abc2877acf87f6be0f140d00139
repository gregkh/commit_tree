cpuidle: menu: Avoid overflows when computing variance

The variance computation in get_typical_interval() may overflow if
the square of the value of diff exceeds the maximum for the int64_t
data type value which basically is the case when it is of the order
of UINT_MAX.

However, data points so far in the future don't matter for idle
state selection anyway, so change the initial threshold value in
get_typical_interval() to INT_MAX which will cause more "outlying"
data points to be discarded without affecting the selection result.
