drm/i915: Guard error capture against unpinned vma

If we find an incompletely setup vma inside the request/engine at the
time of a hang, it may not have vma->pages initialised, so skip
capturing the object before we iterate over NULL.

Spotted by Matthew in preparation for using unpinned vma to track engine
state.
