drm/i915/execlists: Move RPCS setup to context pin

Configuring RPCS in context image just before pin is sufficient and will
come extra handy in one of the following patches.

v2:
 * Split image setup a bit differently. (Chris Wilson)

v3:
 * Update context image after reset as well - otherwise the application
   of pinned default state clears the RPCS.

v4:
 * Use local variable throughout the function. (Chris Wilson)
