ext4: add mask of ext4 flags to swap

The reason is that while swapping two inode, we swap the flags too.
Some flags such as EXT4_JOURNAL_DATA_FL can really confuse the things
since we're not resetting the address operations structure.  The
simplest way to keep things sane is to restrict the flags that can be
swapped.
