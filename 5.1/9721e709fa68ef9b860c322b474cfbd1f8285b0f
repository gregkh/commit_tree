tcp: simplify window probe aborting on USER_TIMEOUT

Previously we use the next unsent skb's timestamp to determine
when to abort a socket stalling on window probes. This no longer
works as skb timestamp reflects the last instead of the first
transmission.

Instead we can estimate how long the socket has been stalling
with the probe count and the exponential backoff behavior.
