dpaa2-eth: Use a single page per Rx buffer

Instead of allocating page fragments via the network stack,
use the page allocator directly. For now, we consume one page
for each Rx buffer.

With the new memory model we are free to consider adding more
XDP support.

Performance decreases slightly in some IP forwarding cases.
No visible effect on termination traffic. The driver memory
footprint increases as a result of this change, but it is
still small enough to not really matter.

Another side effect is that now Rx buffer alignment requirements
are naturally satisfied without any additional actions needed.
Remove alignment related code, except in the buffer layout
information conveyed to MC, as hardware still needs to know the
alignment value we guarantee.
