ALSA: fireface: obsolete proc node to leave one node

In a series of Fireface, latter protocol has no way for drivers to
retrieve current clock configuration. On the other hand, this driver
has proc node for it.

This commit removes a proc node to dump both clock configuration
and synchronization status in one proc node.
