net: stmmac: use correct DMA buffer size in the RX descriptor

We always program the maximum DMA buffer size into the receive descriptor,
although the allocated size may be less. E.g. with the default MTU size
we allocate only 1536 bytes. If somebody sends us a bigger frame, then
memory may get corrupted.

Fix by using exact buffer sizes.
