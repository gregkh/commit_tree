drm/nouveau: Remove bogus cleanup in nv50_mstm_add_connector()

Trying to destroy the connector using mstc->connector.funcs->destroy()
if connector initialization fails is wrong: there is no possible
codepath in nv50_mstc_new where nv50_mstm_add_connector() would return
<0 and mstc would be non-NULL.
