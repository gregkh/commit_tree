scsi: lpfc: Fix error codes in lpfc_sli4_pci_mem_setup()

It used to be that "error" was set to -ENODEV at the start of the function
but we shifted some code around an now "error" is set to zero for most
error paths.  There is a mix of direct returns and "goto out" but I changed
everything to direct returns for consistency.
