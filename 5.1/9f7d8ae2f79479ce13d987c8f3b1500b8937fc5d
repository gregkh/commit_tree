nvme-fc: use nr_phys_segments to determine existence of sgl

For some nvme command, when issued by the nvme core layer, there
is an internal buffer which can cause blk_rq_payload_bytes() to
return a non-zero value yet there is no actual/real command payload
and sg list.  An example is the WRITE ZEROES command.

To address this, when making choices on whether to dma map an sgl,
use blk_rq_nr_phys_segments() instead of blk_rq_payload_bytes().
When there is a sgl, blk_rq_payload_bytes() will return the amount
of data to be transferred by the sgl.
