ice: Fix added in VSI supported nodes calc

VSI supported nodes are calculated in order to add the VSI parent or
intermediate nodes to the scheduler tree. If one of the node in below
layers (from VSI layer) has space to add the new VSI or intermediate node
above that layer then it's not required to continue the calculation further
for below layers.
