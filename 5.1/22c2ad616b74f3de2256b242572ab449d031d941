net: add a route cache full diagnostic message

In some testing scenarios, dst/route cache can fill up so quickly
that even an explicit GC call occasionally fails to clean it up. This leads
to sporadically failing calls to dst_alloc and "network unreachable" errors
to the user, which is confusing.

This patch adds a diagnostic message to make the cause of the failure
easier to determine.
