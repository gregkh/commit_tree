perf/core: Fix the address filtering fix

The following recent commit:

  c60f83b813e5 ("perf, pt, coresight: Fix address filters for vmas with non-zero offset")

changes the address filtering logic to communicate filter ranges to the PMU driver
via a single address range object, instead of having the driver do the final bit of
math.

That change forgets to take into account kernel filters, which are not calculated
the same way as DSO based filters.

Fix that by passing the kernel filters the same way as file-based filters.
This doesn't require any additional changes in the drivers.
