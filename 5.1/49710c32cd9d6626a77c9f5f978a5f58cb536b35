media: s5p-jpeg: Check for fmt_ver_flag when doing fmt enumeration

Previously when doing format enumeration, it was returning all
 formats supported by driver, even if they're not supported by hw.
Add missing check for fmt_ver_flag, so it'll be fixed and only those
 supported by hw will be returned. Similar thing is already done
 in s5p_jpeg_find_format.

It was found by using v4l2-compliance tool and checking result
 of VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT/FRAMESIZES/FRAMEINTERVALS test
and using v4l2-ctl to get list of all supported formats.

Tested on s5pv210-galaxys (Samsung i9000 phone).

Fixes: bb677f3ac434 ("[media] Exynos4 JPEG codec v4l2 driver")
