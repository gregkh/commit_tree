net/mlx5e: Add tx timeout support for mlx5e tx reporter

With this patch, ndo_tx_timeout callback will be redirected to the tx
reporter in order to detect a tx timeout error and report it to the
devlink health. (The watchdog detects tx timeouts, but the driver verify
the issue still exists before launching any recover method).

In addition, recover from tx timeout in case of lost interrupt was added
to the tx reporter recover method. The tx timeout recover from lost
interrupt is not a new feature in the driver, this patch re-organize the
functionality and move it to the tx reporter recovery flow.

tx timeout example:
(with auto_recover set to false, if set to true, the manual recover and
diagnose sections are irrelevant)
