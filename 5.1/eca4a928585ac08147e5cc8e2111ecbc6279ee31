net/mlx5: E-Switch, Fix esw manager vport indication for more vport commands

Traditionally, the PF (Physical Function) which resides on vport 0 was
the E-switch manager. Since the ECPF (Embedded CPU Physical Function),
which resides on vport 0xfffe, was introduced as the E-Switch manager,
the assumption that the E-switch manager is on vport 0 is incorrect.

Since the eswitch code already uses the actual vport value, all we
need is to always set other_vport=1.
