jbd2: fix invalid descriptor block checksum

In jbd2_journal_commit_transaction(), if we are in abort mode,
we may flush the buffer without setting descriptor block checksum
by goto start_journal_io. Then fs is mounted,
jbd2_descriptor_block_csum_verify() failed.

[  271.379811] EXT4-fs (vdd): shut down requested (2)
[  271.381827] Aborting journal on device vdd-8.
[  271.597136] JBD2: Invalid checksum recovering block 22199 in log
[  271.598023] JBD2: recovery failed
[  271.598484] EXT4-fs (vdd): error loading journal

Fix this problem by keep setting descriptor block checksum if the
descriptor buffer is not NULL.

This checksum problem can be reproduced by xfstests generic/388.
