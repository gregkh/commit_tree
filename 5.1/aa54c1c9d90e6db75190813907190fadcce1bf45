spi: fix initial SPI_SR value in spi-fsl-dspi

On ColdFire mcf54418, using DSPI_DMA_MODE mode, spi transfers
at first boot stage are not succeding:

m25p80 spi0.1: unrecognized JEDEC id bytes: 00, 00, 00

The reason is the SPI_SR initial value set by the driver, that
is not clearing (not setting to 1) the RF_DF flag. After a tour
on the dspi hw modules that use this driver(Vybrid, ColdFire and
ls1021a) a better init value for SR register has been set.
