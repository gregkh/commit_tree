ARM: davinci: aintc: use the new config structure

Modify the aintc driver to take all its configuration from the new
config structure. Stop referencing davinci_soc_info in any way.
Move the declaration for davinci_aintc_init() to irq-davinci-aintc.h
and make it take the new config structure as parameter. Convert all
users to the new version.
