bpf: add bpf helper bpf_skb_ecn_set_ce

This patch adds a new bpf helper BPF_FUNC_skb_ecn_set_ce
"int bpf_skb_ecn_set_ce(struct sk_buff *skb)". It is added to
BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SKB typed bpf_prog which currently can
be attached to the ingress and egress path. The helper is needed
because his type of bpf_prog cannot modify the skb directly.

This helper is used to set the ECN field of ECN capable IP packets to ce
(congestion encountered) in the IPv6 or IPv4 header of the skb. It can be
used by a bpf_prog to manage egress or ingress network bandwdith limit
per cgroupv2 by inducing an ECN response in the TCP sender.
This works best when using DCTCP.
