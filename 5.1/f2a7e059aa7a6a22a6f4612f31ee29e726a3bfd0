ACPI / APEI: Pass ghes and estatus separately to avoid a later copy

The NMI-like notifications scribble over ghes->estatus, before
copying it somewhere else. If this interrupts the ghes_probe() code
calling ghes_proc() on each struct ghes, the data is corrupted.

All the NMI-like notifications should use a queued estatus entry
from the beginning, instead of the ghes version, then copying it.
To do this, break up any use of "ghes->estatus" so that all
functions take the estatus as an argument.

This patch just moves these ghes->estatus dereferences into separate
arguments, no change in behaviour. struct ghes becomes unused in
ghes_clear_estatus() as it only wanted ghes->estatus, which we now
pass directly. This is removed.
