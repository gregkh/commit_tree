ovl: Do not lose security.capability xattr over metadata file copy-up

If a file has been copied up metadata only, and later data is copied up,
upper loses any security.capability xattr it has (underlying filesystem
clears it as upon file write).

From a user's point of view, this is just a file copy-up and that should
not result in losing security.capability xattr.  Hence, before data copy
up, save security.capability xattr (if any) and restore it on upper after
data copy up is complete.
