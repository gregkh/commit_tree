tracing: Add comment to predicate_parse() about "&&" or "||"

As the predicat_parse() code is rather complex, commenting subtleties is
important. The switch case statement should be commented to describe that it
is only looking for two '&' or '|' together, which is why the fall through
to an error is after the check.
