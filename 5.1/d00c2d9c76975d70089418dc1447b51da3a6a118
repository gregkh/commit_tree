Btrfs: do not overwrite error return value in the balance ioctl

If the call to btrfs_balance() failed we would overwrite the error
returned to user space with -EFAULT if the call to copy_to_user() failed
as well. Fix that by calling copy_to_user() only if btrfs_balance()
returned success or was canceled.
