devlink: Add health report functionality

Upon error discover, every driver can report it to the devlink health
mechanism via devlink_health_report function, using the appropriate
reporter registered to it. Driver can pass error specific context which
will be delivered to it as part of the dump / recovery callbacks.

Once an error is reported, devlink health will do the following actions:
* A log is being send to the kernel trace events buffer
* Health status and statistics are being updated for the reporter instance
* Object dump is being taken and stored at the reporter instance (as long
  as there is no other dump which is already stored)
* Auto recovery attempt is being done. Depends on:
  - Auto Recovery configuration
  - Grace period vs. Time since last recover
