LSM: Tie enabling logic to presence in ordered list

Until now, any LSM without an enable storage variable was considered
enabled. This inverts the logic and sets defaults to true only if the
LSM gets added to the ordered initialization list. (And an exception
continues for the major LSMs until they are integrated into the ordered
initialization in a later patch.)
