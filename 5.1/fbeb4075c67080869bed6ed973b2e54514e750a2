IB/mlx5: Let read user wqe also from SRQ buffer

Reading a WQE from SRQ is almost identical to reading from regular RQ.
The differences are the size of the queue, the size of a WQE and buffer
location.

Make necessary changes to mlx5_ib_read_user_wqe() to let it read a WQE
from a SRQ or RQ by caller choice.
