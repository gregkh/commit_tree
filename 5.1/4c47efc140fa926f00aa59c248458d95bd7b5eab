scsi: lpfc: Move SCSI and NVME Stats to hardware queue structures

Many io statistics were being sampled and saved using adapter-based data
structures. This was creating a lot of contention and cache thrashing in
the I/O path.

Move the statistics to the hardware queue data structures.  Given the
per-queue data structures, use of atomic types is lessened.

Add new sysfs and debugfs stat routines to collate the per hardware queue
values and report at an adapter level.
