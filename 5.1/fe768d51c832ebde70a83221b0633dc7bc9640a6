CIFS: Return error code when getting file handle for writeback

Now we just return NULL cifsFileInfo pointer in cases we didn't find
or couldn't reopen a file. This hides errors from cifs_reopen_file()
especially retryable errors which should be handled appropriately.
Create new cifs_get_writable_file() routine that returns error codes
from cifs_reopen_file() and use it in the writeback codepath.
