doc: networking: prepare offload documents for conversion into RST

Add small number of markups which are sufficient for conversion
into reStructuredText.

Unfortunately there was necessary to restructure all sections
in checksum-offloads.txt file and create paragraphs separated
by newline. There also must not be a space at the
beginning of paragpraph.

There are no semantic changes.
