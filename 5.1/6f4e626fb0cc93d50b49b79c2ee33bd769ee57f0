scsi: ata: Use unsigned int for cmd's type in ioctls in scsi_host_template

Clang warns several times in the scsi subsystem (trimmed for brevity):

drivers/scsi/hpsa.c:6209:7: warning: overflow converting case value to
switch condition type (2147762695 to 18446744071562347015) [-Wswitch]
        case CCISS_GETBUSTYPES:
             ^
drivers/scsi/hpsa.c:6208:7: warning: overflow converting case value to
switch condition type (2147762694 to 18446744071562347014) [-Wswitch]
        case CCISS_GETHEARTBEAT:
             ^

The root cause is that the _IOC macro can generate really large numbers,
which don't fit into type 'int', which is used for the cmd parameter in
the ioctls in scsi_host_template. My research into how GCC and Clang are
handling this at a low level didn't prove fruitful. However, looking at
the rest of the kernel tree, all ioctls use an 'unsigned int' for the
cmd parameter, which will fit all of the _IOC values in the scsi/ata
subsystems.

Make that change because none of the ioctls expect a negative value for
any command, it brings the ioctls inline with the reset of the kernel,
and it removes ambiguity, which is never good when dealing with compilers.
