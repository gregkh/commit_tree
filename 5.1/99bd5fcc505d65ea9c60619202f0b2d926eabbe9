ARC: PAE40: don't panic and instead turn off hw ioc

HSDK currently panics when built for HIGHMEM/ARC_HAS_PAE40 because ioc
is enabled with default which doesn't work for the 2 non contiguous
memory nodes. So get PAE working by disabling ioc instead.

Tested with !PAE40 by forcing @ioc_enable=0 and running the glibc
testsuite over ssh
