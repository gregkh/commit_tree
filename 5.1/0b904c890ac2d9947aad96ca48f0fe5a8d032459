drm/i915/icl: restore WaEnableFloatBlendOptimization

Enables blend optimization for floating point RTs

This restores the workaround that was reverted in c358514ba8da
("Revert "drm/i915/icl: WaEnableFloatBlendOptimization"").

The revert was due to the register write seemingly not sticking,
but the HW team has confirmed that this is because the
register is WO and that the workaround is indeed required.

Here the wa is added with a mask of 0 since the register is WO.
