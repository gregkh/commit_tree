x86/ftrace: Fix warning and considate ftrace_jmp_replace() and ftrace_call_replace()

Arnd reported the following compiler warning:

arch/x86/kernel/ftrace.c:669:23: error: 'ftrace_jmp_replace' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]

The ftrace_jmp_replace() function now only has a single user and should be
simply moved by that user. But looking at the code, it shows that
ftrace_jmp_replace() is similar to ftrace_call_replace() except that instead
of using the opcode of 0xe8 it uses 0xe9. It makes more sense to consolidate
that function into one implementation that both ftrace_jmp_replace() and
ftrace_call_replace() use by passing in the op code separate.

The structure in ftrace_code_union is also modified to replace the "e8"
field with the more appropriate name "op".
