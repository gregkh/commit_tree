mtd: rawnand: Stop using chip->state in drivers

We are about to simplify the locking in the rawnand framework, and part
of this simplication is about getting rid of chip->state, so let's
first patch drivers that check the state.

All of them do that to get a timeout value based on the operation that
is being executed. Since a timeout is, by definition, something that
is here to prevent hanging on an event that might never happen,
picking the maximum timeout value no matter the operation should be
harmless.
