xfs: also truncate holes covered by COW blocks

This only matters if we want to write data through the COW fork that is
not actually an overwrite of existing data.  Reasons for that are
speculative COW fork allocations using the cowextsize, or a mode where
we always write through the COW fork.  Currently both can't actually
happen, but I plan to enable them.
