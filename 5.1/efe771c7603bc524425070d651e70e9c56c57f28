mm, compaction: always finish scanning of a full pageblock

When compaction is finishing, it uses a flag to ensure the pageblock is
complete but it makes sense to always complete migration of a pageblock.
Minimally, skip information is based on a pageblock and partially
scanned pageblocks may incur more scanning in the future.  The pageblock
skip handling also becomes more strict later in the series and the hint
is more useful if a complete pageblock was always scanned.

The potentially impacts latency as more scanning is done but it's not a
consistent win or loss as the scanning is not always a high percentage
of the pageblock and sometimes it is offset by future reductions in
scanning.  Hence, the results are not presented this time due to a
misleading mix of gains/losses without any clear pattern.  However, full
scanning of the pageblock is important for later patches.
