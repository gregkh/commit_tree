x86/TSC: Use RDTSCP

Currently, the kernel uses

  [LM]FENCE; RDTSC

in the timekeeping code, to guarantee monotonicity of time where the
*FENCE is selected based on vendor.

Replace that sequence with RDTSCP which is faster or on-par and gives
the same guarantees.

A microbenchmark on Intel shows that the change is on-par.

On AMD, the change is either on-par with the current LFENCE-prefixed
RDTSC or slightly better with RDTSCP.

The comparison is done with the LFENCE-prefixed RDTSC (and not with the
MFENCE-prefixed one, as one would normally expect) because all modern
AMD families make LFENCE serializing and thus avoid the heavy MFENCE by
effectively enabling X86_FEATURE_LFENCE_RDTSC.
