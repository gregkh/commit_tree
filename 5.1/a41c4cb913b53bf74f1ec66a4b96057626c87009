ALSA: pcm: Make PCM linked list consistent while re-grouping

Make a common helper to re-assign the PCM link using list_move() instead
of open code with manual list_del() and list_add_tail().  This assures
the consistency and we can get rid of snd_pcm_group.count field -- its
purpose is only to check whether the list is singular, and we can know
it by list_is_singular() call now.
