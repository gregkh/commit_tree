s390/cpum_cf: Handle EBUSY return code from CPU counter facility reservation

Rservation of the CPU Measurement Counter facility may fail if
it is already in use by the cf_diag device driver.
This is indicated by a non zero return code (-EBUSY).
However this return code is ignored and the counter facility
may be used in parallel by different device drivers.

Handle the failing reservation and return an error to the
caller.
