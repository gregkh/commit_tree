btf: expose API to work with raw btf data

This patch exposes new API btf__get_raw_data() that allows to get a copy
of raw BTF data out of struct btf. This is useful for external programs
that need to manipulate raw data, e.g., pahole using btf__dedup() to
deduplicate BTF type info and then writing it back to file.
