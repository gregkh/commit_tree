ext4: unlock unused_pages timely when doing writeback

In mpage_add_bh_to_extent(), when accumulated extents length is greater
than MAX_WRITEPAGES_EXTENT_LEN or buffer head's b_stat is not equal, we
will not continue to search unmapped area for this page, but note this
page is locked, and will only be unlocked in mpage_release_unused_pages()
after ext4_io_submit, if io also is throttled by blk-throttle or similar
io qos, we will hold this page locked for a while, it's unnecessary.

I think the best fix is to refactor mpage_add_bh_to_extent() to let it
return some hints whether to unlock this page, but given that we will
improve dioread_nolock later, we can let it done later, so currently
the simple fix would just call mpage_release_unused_pages() before
ext4_io_submit().
