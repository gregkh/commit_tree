HID: input: fix mapping of aspect ratio key

According to HUTRR37 usage 0x6d from the consumer usage page corresponds
to action that selects the next available supported aspect ratio option
on a device which outputs or displays video. However KEY_ZOOM means
activate "Full Screen" mode, KEY_ASPECT_RATIO should be used instead.
