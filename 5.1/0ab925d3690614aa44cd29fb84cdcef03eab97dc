drm/amd/display: Only allow VRR when vrefresh is within supported range

[Why]
Black screens or artifacting can occur when enabling FreeSync outside
of the supported range of the monitor. This can happen since the
supported range isn't always the min/max vrefresh range available for
the monitor.

[How]
There was previously a fix that prevented this from happening in the
low range but it didn't cover the upper range. Expand the condition
to include both.
