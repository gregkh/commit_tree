kbuild: add real-prereqs shorthand for $(filter-out FORCE,$^)

In Kbuild, if_changed and friends must have FORCE as a prerequisite.

Hence, $(filter-out FORCE,$^) or $(filter-out $(PHONY),$^) is a common
idiom to get the names of all the prerequisites except phony targets.

Add real-prereqs as a shorthand.

Note:
We cannot replace $(filter %.o,$^) in cmd_link_multi-m because $^ may
include auto-generated dependencies from the .*.cmd file when a single
object module is changed into a multi object module. Refer to commit
69ea912fda74 ("kbuild: remove unneeded link_multi_deps"). I added some
comment to avoid accidental breakage.
