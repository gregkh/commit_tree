scsi: ibmvscsi: Protect ibmvscsi_head from concurrent modificaiton

For each ibmvscsi host created during a probe or destroyed during a remove
we either add or remove that host to/from the global ibmvscsi_head
list. This runs the risk of concurrent modification.

This patch adds a simple spinlock around the list modification calls to
prevent concurrent updates as is done similarly in the ibmvfc driver and
ipr driver.
