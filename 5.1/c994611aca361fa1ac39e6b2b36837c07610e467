platform/x86: asus-wmi: Allow loading on systems without the Asus Management GUID

hid-asus depends on asus-wmi through the asus_wmi_evaluate_method. Before
this commit asus-wmi, and thus hid-asus, could not be loaded on non-Asus
systems. This breaks using Asus bluetooth keyboards such as the Asus
T100CHI keyboard with non Asus systems.

This commit fixes this by allowing asus-wmi to load on systems without the
Asus Management GUID.

This is safe to do since all asus-wmi sub drivers use
asus_wmi_register_driver which also checks for the GUID.

This commit also improves the error messages in asus_wmi_register_driver
to include "ASUS" in their description to make them more clear. This is
important since we now rely on those errors when loaded on systems without
the Asus Management GUID.
