HID: quirks: Drop misused kernel-doc annotation

The kernel-doc annotation is misused for hid_mouse_ignore_list. The script
complains about it:

drivers/hid/hid-quirks.c:894: warning: cannot understand function prototype: 'const struct hid_device_id hid_mouse_ignore_list[] = '

Drop the annotation to make script happy.
