media: ov5640: Move test_pattern_menu before ov5640_set_ctrl_test_pattern

The OV5640 has many options for generating test patterns. Unfortunately
there is only one V4L2 control for it. Thus the driver would need to
list some or all combinations.

Move the test_pattern_menu list before the ov5640_set_ctrl_test_pattern
function that programs the hardware. This would allow us to add a
matching list of values to program into the hardware, while keeping the
two lists together for ease of maintenance.
