spi: spi-geni-qcom: Don't initialize completion for normal message

We only use this completion when we're doing something that isn't a
message transfer. For example, changing CS or aborting/canceling a
command. All of those situations properly reinitialize the completion
before sending the GENI the special command to change CS or cancel, etc.
Given that, let's remove the initialization here.
