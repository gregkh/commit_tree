mmc: mmci: Send a CMD12 to clear the DPSM at errors

The current approach with sending a CMD12 (STOP_TRANSMISSION) to complete a
data transfer request, either because of using the open-ended transmission
type or because of receiving an error during a pre-defined data transfer,
isn't sufficient for the STM32 sdmmc variant. More precisely, this variant
needs to clear the DPSM ("Data Path State Machine") by sending a CMD12, for
all failing ADTC commands.

Support this, by adding a struct mmc_command inside the struct mmci_host
and initialize it to a CMD12 during ->probe(). Let's also add checks for
the new conditions, to enable mmci_data_irq() and mmci_cmd_irq() to
postpone the calls to mmci_request_end(), but instead send the CMD12.
