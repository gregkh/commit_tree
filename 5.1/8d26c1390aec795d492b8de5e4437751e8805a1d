arm64: dts: hikey: Revert "Enable HS200 mode on eMMC"

This reverts commit abd7d0972a192ee653efc7b151a6af69db58f2bb. This
change was already partially reverted by John Stultz in
commit 9c6d26df1fae ("arm64: dts: hikey: Fix eMMC corruption regression").

This change appears to cause controller resets and block read failures
which prevents successful booting on some hikey boards.
