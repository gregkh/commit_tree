remoteproc: qcom: q6v5-mss: Add missing clocks for MSM8996

Proxy vote for QDSS clock and remove vote on handover interrupt
to provide MSS PBL with access to STM hardware registers during
boot. Add "snoc_axi" and "mnoc_axi" to the active clock list.
Rename "gpll0_mss_clk" to "gpll0_mss" for consistency across SoCs.
