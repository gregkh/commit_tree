driver core: Remove the link if there is no driver with AUTO flag

DL_FLAG_AUTOREMOVE_CONSUMER/SUPPLIER means "Remove the link
automatically on consumer/supplier driver unbind", that means we should
remove whole the device_link when there is no this driver no matter what
the ref_count of the link is.
