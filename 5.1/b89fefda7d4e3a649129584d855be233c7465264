spi: spi-gpio: fix SPI_CS_HIGH capability

spi-gpio is capable of dealing with active-high chip-selects.
Unfortunately, commit 4b859db2c606 ("spi: spi-gpio: add SPI_3WIRE
support") broke this by setting master->mode_bits, which overrides
the setting in the spi-bitbang code.  Fix this.

[Fixed a trivial conflict with SPI_3WIRE_HIZ support -- broonie]
