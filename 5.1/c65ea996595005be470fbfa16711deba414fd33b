ipmi: Fix how the lower layers are told to watch for messages

The IPMI driver has a mechanism to tell the lower layers it needs
to watch for messages, commands, and watchdogs (so it doesn't
needlessly poll).  However, it needed some extensions, it needed
a way to tell what is being waited for so it could set the timeout
appropriately.

The update to the lower layer was also being done once a second
at best because it was done in the main timeout handler.  However,
if a command is sent and a response message is coming back,
it needed to be started immediately.  So modify the code to
update immediately if it needs to be enabled.  Disable is still
lazy.
