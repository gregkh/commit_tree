net: stmmac: don't set own bit too early for jumbo frames

Commit 0e80bdc9a72d ("stmmac: first frame prep at the end of xmit
routine") overlooked jumbo frames when re-ordering the code, and as a
result the own bit was not getting set anymore for the first jumbo frame
descriptor. Commit 487e2e22ab79 ("net: stmmac: Set OWN bit for jumbo
frames") tried to fix this, but now the bit is getting set too early and
the DMA may start while we are still setting up the remaining descriptors.
And with the chain mode the own bit remains still unset.

Fix by setting the own bit at the end of xmit also with jumbo frames.
