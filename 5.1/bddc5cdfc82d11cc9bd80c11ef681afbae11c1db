media: ov5640: Add three more test patterns

The OV5640 driver currently supports a static color bar pattern with a
small vertical gamma gradient. The hardware also supports a color square
pattern, as well as having a rolling bar for dynamic sequences.

Add three more test patterns:

  - color bars with a rolling bar (but without the gamma gradient)
  - static color squares
  - color squares with a rolling bar
