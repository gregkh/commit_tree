cfg80211: Add airtime statistics and settings

This adds TX airtime statistics to the cfg80211 station dump (to go along
with the RX info already present), and adds a new parameter to set the
airtime weight of each station. The latter allows userspace to implement
policies for different stations by varying their weights.
