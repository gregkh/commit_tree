tty: serial: meson: if no alias specified use an available id

At probe, the uart driver tries to get an id from a device tree alias.
When no alias was specified, the driver would return an error and probing
would fail.

Providing an alias for registering a serial device should not be mandatory.
If the device tree does not specify an alias, provide an id from a reserved
range so that the probing can continue.
