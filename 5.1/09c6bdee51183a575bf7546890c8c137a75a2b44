iio: adc: at91: disable adc channel interrupt in timeout case

Having a brief look at at91_adc_read_raw() it is obvious that in the case
of a timeout the setting of AT91_ADC_CHDR and AT91_ADC_IDR registers is
omitted. If 2 different channels are queried we can end up with a
situation where two interrupts are enabled, but only one interrupt is
cleared in the interrupt handler. Resulting in a interrupt loop and a
system hang.
