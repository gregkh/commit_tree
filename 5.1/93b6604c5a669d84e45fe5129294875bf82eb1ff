i2c: Allow recovery of the initial IRQ by an I2C client device.

A previous change allowed I2C client devices to discover new IRQs upon
reprobe by clearing the IRQ in i2c_device_remove. However, if an IRQ was
assigned in i2c_new_device, that information is lost.

For example, the touchscreen and trackpad devices on a Dell Inspiron laptop
are I2C devices whose IRQs are defined by ACPI extended IRQ types. The
client device structures are initialized during an ACPI walk. After
removing the i2c_hid device, modprobe fails.

This change caches the initial IRQ value in i2c_new_device and then resets
the client device IRQ to the initial value in i2c_device_remove.

[wsa: this is an easy to backport fix for the regression. We will
refactor the code to handle irq assignments better in general.]
