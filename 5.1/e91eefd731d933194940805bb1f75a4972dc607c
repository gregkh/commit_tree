tracing: Add alternative synthetic event trace action syntax

Add a 'trace(synthetic_event_name, params)' alternative to
synthetic_event_name(params).

Currently, the syntax used for generating synthetic events is to
invoke synthetic_event_name(params) i.e. use the synthetic event name
as a function call.

Users requested a new form that more explicitly shows that the
synthetic event is in effect being traced.  In this version, a new
'trace()' keyword is used, and the synthetic event name is passed in
as the first argument.

In addition, for the sake of consistency with other actions, change
the documention to emphasize the trace() form over the function-call
form, which remains documented as equivalent.
