driver core: Rewrite test_async_driver_probe to cover serialization and NUMA affinity

The current async_probe test code is only testing one device allocated
prior to driver load and only loading one device afterwards. Instead of
doing things this way it makes much more sense to load one device per CPU
in order to actually stress the async infrastructure. By doing this we
should see delays significantly increase in the event of devices being
serialized.

In addition I have updated the test to verify that we are trying to place
the work on the correct NUMA node when we are running in async mode. By
doing this we can verify the best possible outcome for device and driver
load times.

I have added a timeout value that is used to disable the sleep and instead
cause the probe routine to report an error indicating it timed out. By
doing this we limit the maximum runtime for the test to 20 seconds or less.

The last major change in this set is that I have gone through and tuned it
for handling the massive number of possible events that will be scheduled.
Instead of reporting the sleep for each individual device it is moved to
only being displayed if we enable debugging.

With this patch applied below are what a failing test and a passing test
should look like. I elided a few hundred lines in the failing test that
were duplicated since the system I was testing on had a massive number of
CPU cores:
