RDMA/ucontext: Fix regression with disassociate

When this code was consolidated the intention was that the VMA would
become backed by anonymous zero pages after the zap_vma_pte - however this
very subtly relied on setting the vm_ops = NULL and clearing the VM_SHARED
bits to transform the VMA into an anonymous VMA. Since the vm_ops was
removed this broke.

Now userspace gets a SIGBUS if it touches the vma after disassociation.

Instead of converting the VMA to anonymous provide a fault handler that
puts a zero'd page into the VMA when user-space touches it after
disassociation.
