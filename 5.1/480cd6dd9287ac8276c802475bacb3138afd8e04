drm/i915/selftests: Track evict objects explicitly

During review of commit 71fc448c1aaf ("drm/i915/selftests: Make evict
tolerant of foreign objects"), Matthew mentioned it would be better if
we explicitly tracked the objects we created. We have an obj->st_link
hook for this purpose, so add the corresponding list of objects and
reduce our loops to only consider our own list.
