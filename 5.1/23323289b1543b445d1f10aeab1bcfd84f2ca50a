netlink: reduce NLA_POLICY_NESTED{,_ARRAY} arguments

In typical cases, there's no need to pass both the maxattr
and the policy array pointer, as the maxattr should just be
ARRAY_SIZE(policy) - 1. Therefore, to be less error prone,
just remove the maxattr argument from the default macros
and deduce the size accordingly.

Leave the original macros with a leading underscore to use
here and in case somebody needs to pass a policy pointer
where the policy isn't declared in the same place and thus
ARRAY_SIZE() cannot be used.
