samples/bpf: Add a "force" flag to XDP samples

Make xdp samples consistent with iproute2 behavior and set the
XDP_FLAGS_UPDATE_IF_NOEXIST by default when setting the xdp program on
interface. Provide an option for user to force the program loading,
which as a result will not include the mentioned flag in
bpf_set_link_xdp_fd call.
