fuse: Wake up req->waitq of only if not background

Currently, we wait on req->waitq in request_wait_answer() function only,
and it's never used for background requests.  Since wake_up() is not a
light-weight macros, instead of this, it unfolds in really called function,
which makes locking operations taking some cpu cycles, let's avoid its call
for the case we definitely know it's completely useless.
