selftests: kvm: add a selftest for SMM

Add a simple test for SMM, based on VMX.  The test implements its own
sync between the guest and the host as using our ucall library seems to
be too cumbersome: SMI handler is happening in real-address mode.

This patch also fixes KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE to happen after
KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS, in fact it places it last.  This is because
KVM needs to know whether the processor is in SMM or not.
