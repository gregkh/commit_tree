firmware: arm_sdei: Add ACPI GHES registration helper

APEI's Generic Hardware Error Source structures do not describe
whether the SDEI event is shared or private, as this information is
discoverable via the API.

GHES needs to know whether an event is normal or critical to avoid
sharing locks or fixmap entries, but GHES shouldn't have to know about
the SDEI API.

Add a helper to register the GHES using the appropriate normal or
critical callback.
