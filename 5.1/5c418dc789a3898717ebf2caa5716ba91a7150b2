efi: Fix build error due to enum collision between efi.h and ima.h

The following commit:

  a893ea15d764 ("tpm: move tpm_chip definition to include/linux/tpm.h")

introduced a build error when both IMA and EFI are enabled:

    In file included from ../security/integrity/ima/ima_fs.c:30:
    ../security/integrity/ima/ima.h:176:7: error: redeclaration of enumerator "NONE"

What happens is that both headers (ima.h and efi.h) defines the same
'NONE' constant, and it broke when they started getting included from
the same file:

Rework to prefix the EFI enum with 'EFI_*'.
