nfp: fix simple vNIC mailbox length

The simple vNIC mailbox length should be 12 decimal and not 0x12.
Using a decimal also makes it clear this is a length value and not
another field within the simple mailbox defines.

Found by code inspection, there are no known firmware configurations
where this would cause issues.
