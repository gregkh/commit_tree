ath10k: fix shadow register implementation for WCN3990

WCN3990 supports shadow registers write operation support
for copy engine for regular operation in powersave mode.

Since WCN3990 is a 64-bit target, the shadow register
implementation needs to be done in the copy engine handlers
for 64-bit target. Currently the shadow register implementation
is present in the 32-bit target handlers of copy engine.

Fix the shadow register copy engine write operation
implementation for 64-bit target(WCN3990).

Tested HW: WCN3990
Tested FW: WLAN.HL.2.0-01188-QCAHLSWMTPLZ-1
