CIFS: keep FileInfo handle live during oplock break

In the oplock break handler, writing pending changes from pages puts
the FileInfo handle. If the refcount reaches zero it closes the handle
and waits for any oplock break handler to return, thus causing a deadlock.

To prevent this situation:

* We add a wait flag to cifsFileInfo_put() to decide whether we should
  wait for running/pending oplock break handlers

* We keep an additionnal reference of the SMB FileInfo handle so that
  for the rest of the handler putting the handle won't close it.
  - The ref is bumped everytime we queue the handler via the
    cifs_queue_oplock_break() helper.
  - The ref is decremented at the end of the handler
