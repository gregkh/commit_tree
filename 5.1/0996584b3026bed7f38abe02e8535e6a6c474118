PM-runtime: Call pm_runtime_active|suspended_time() from sysfs

Avoid the open-coding of the accounted time acquisition in
runtime_active|suspend_time_show() and make them call
pm_runtime_active|suspended_time() instead.

Note that this change also indirectly avoids holding dev->power.lock
around the do_div() computation and the sprintf() call which is an
additional improvement.
