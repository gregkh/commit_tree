coresight: etm4x: Add support to enable ETMv4.2

SDM845 has ETMv4.2 and can use the existing etm4x driver.
But the current etm driver checks only for ETMv4.0 and
errors out for other etm4x versions. This patch adds this
missing support to enable SoC's with ETMv4x to use same
driver by checking only the ETM architecture major version
number.

Without this change, we get below error during etm probe:

/ # dmesg | grep etm

With this change, etm probe is successful:
