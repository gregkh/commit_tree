net/tls: Move protocol constants from cipher context to tls context

Each tls context maintains two cipher contexts (one each for tx and rx
directions). For each tls session, the constants such as protocol
version, ciphersuite, iv size, associated data size etc are same for
both the directions and need to be stored only once per tls context.
Hence these are moved from 'struct cipher_context' to 'struct
tls_prot_info' and stored only once in 'struct tls_context'.
