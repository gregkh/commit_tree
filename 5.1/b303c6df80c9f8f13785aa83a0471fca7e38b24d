kbuild: compute false-positive -Wmaybe-uninitialized cases in Kconfig

Since -Wmaybe-uninitialized was introduced by GCC 4.7, we have patched
various false positives:

 - commit e74fc973b6e5 ("Turn off -Wmaybe-uninitialized when building
   with -Os") turned off this option for -Os.

 - commit 815eb71e7149 ("Kbuild: disable 'maybe-uninitialized' warning
   for CONFIG_PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES") turned off this option for
   CONFIG_PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES

 - commit a76bcf557ef4 ("Kbuild: enable -Wmaybe-uninitialized warning
   for "make W=1"") turned off this option for GCC < 4.9
   Arnd provided more explanation in https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/3/14/903

I think this looks better by shifting the logic from Makefile to Kconfig.
