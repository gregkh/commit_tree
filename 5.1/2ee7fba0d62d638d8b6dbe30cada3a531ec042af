flow_dissector: allow access only to a subset of __sk_buff fields

Use whitelist instead of a blacklist and allow only a small set of
fields that might be relevant in the context of flow dissector:
  * data
  * data_end
  * flow_keys

This is required for the eth_get_headlen case where we have only a
chunk of data to dissect (i.e. trying to read the other skb fields
doesn't make sense).

Note, that it is a breaking API change! However, we've provided
flow_keys->n_proto as a substitute for skb->protocol; and there is
no need to manually handle skb->vlan_present. So even if we
break somebody, the migration is trivial. Unfortunately, we can't
support eth_get_headlen use-case without those breaking changes.
