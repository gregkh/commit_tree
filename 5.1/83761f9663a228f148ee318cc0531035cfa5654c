mfd: sec-core: Return gracefully instead of BUG() if device cannot match

Replace impossible BUG() in probe with a proper return.  This can be
triggered only in case of a clear bug (e.g. adding broken half-support
for new S2MPSXX flavor) but BUG() is discouraged and the boot process
can actually try to continue.
