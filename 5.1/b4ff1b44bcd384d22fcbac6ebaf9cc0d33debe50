cgroup, rstat: Don't flush subtree root unless necessary

cgroup_rstat_cpu_pop_updated() is used to traverse the updated cgroups
on flush.  While it was only visiting updated ones in the subtree, it
was visiting @root unconditionally.  We can easily check whether @root
is updated or not by looking at its ->updated_next just as with the
cgroups in the subtree.

* Remove the unnecessary cgroup_parent() test.  The system root cgroup
  is never updated and thus its ->updated_next is always NULL.  No
  need to test whether cgroup_parent() exists in addition to
  ->updated_next.

* Terminate traverse if ->updated_next is NULL.  This can only happen
  for subtree @root and there's no reason to visit it if it's not
  marked updated.

This reduces cpu consumption when reading a lot of rstat backed files.
In a micro benchmark reading stat from ~1600 cgroups, the sys time was
lowered by >40%.
