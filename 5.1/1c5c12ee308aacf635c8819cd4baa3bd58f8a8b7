net/ncsi: handle overflow when incrementing mac address

Previously BMC's MAC address is calculated by simply adding 1 to the
last byte of network controller's MAC address, and it produces incorrect
result when network controller's MAC address ends with 0xFF.

The problem can be fixed by calling eth_addr_inc() function to increment
MAC address; besides, the MAC address is also validated before assigning
to BMC.
