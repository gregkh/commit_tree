pstore/ram: Replace dummy_data heap memory with stack memory

In ramoops_register_dummy() dummy_data is allocated via kzalloc()
then it will always occupy the heap space after register platform
device via platform_device_register_data(), but it will not be
used any more. So let's free it for system usage, replace it with
stack memory is better due to small size.
