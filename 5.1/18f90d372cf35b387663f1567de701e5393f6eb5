tools arch uapi: Copy missing unistd.h headers for arc, hexagon and riscv

Since those were introduced in:

  c8ce48f06503 ("asm-generic: Make time32 syscall numbers optional")

But when the asm-generic/unistd.h was sync'ed with tools/ in:

  1a787fc5ba18 ("tools headers uapi: Sync copy of asm-generic/unistd.h with the kernel sources")

I forgot to copy the files for the architectures that define
__ARCH_WANT_TIME32_SYSCALLS, so the perf build was breaking there, as
reported by Vineet Gupta for the ARC architecture.

After updating my ARC container to use the glibc based toolchain + cross
building libnuma, zlib and elfutils, I finally managed to reproduce the
problem and verify that this now is fixed and will not regress as will
be tested before each pull req sent upstream.
