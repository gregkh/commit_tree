MIPS: Remove custom MIPS32 __kernel_fsid_t type

For MIPS32 kernels we have a custom definition of __kernel_fsid_t. This
differs from the asm-generic version used by all other architectures &
MIPS64 in one way - it declares the val field as an array of long,
rather than an array of int. Since int & long have identical size &
alignment when targeting MIPS32 anyway, this makes little sense.

Beyond the pointlessness this causes problems for code which prints
entries from the val array, for example the fanotify_encode_fid()
function [1]. If such code uses a format specified suited to an int then
it encounters compiler warnings when building for MIPS32, such as:

  In file included from include/linux/kernel.h:14:0,
                   from include/linux/list.h:9,
                   from include/linux/preempt.h:11,
                   from include/linux/spinlock.h:51,
                   from include/linux/fdtable.h:11,
                   from fs/notify/fanotify/fanotify.c:3:
  fs/notify/fanotify/fanotify.c: In function 'fanotify_encode_fid':
  include/linux/kern_levels.h:5:18: warning: format '%x' expects argument
    of type 'unsigned int', but argument 2 has type 'long int' [-Wformat=]

Remove the custom __kernel_fsid_t definition & make use of the
asm-generic version which will have an identical layout in memory
anyway, in order to remove the inconsistency with other architectures.

One possible regression this could cause if is any code is attempting to
print entries from the val array with a long-sized format specifier, in
which case it would begin seeing compiler warnings when built against
kernel headers including this change. Since such code is exceedingly
rare, and would have to be MIPS32-specific to expect a long, this seems
to be a problem that it's extremely unlikely anyone will encounter.
