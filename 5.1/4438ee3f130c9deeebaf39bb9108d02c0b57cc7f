IB/core: Abort page fault handler silently during owning process exit

It is possible that during a page fault handling, the process that owns
the MR is terminating. The indication for it is failure to get the
task_struct or take reference on the mm_struct. In this case just abort
the page-fault handler with error but without a warning to the kernel log.
