scsi: ibmvfc: Byte swap status and error codes when logging

Status and error codes are returned in big endian from the VIOS. The values
are translated into a human readable format when logged, but the values are
also logged. This patch byte swaps those values so that they are consistent
between BE and LE platforms.
