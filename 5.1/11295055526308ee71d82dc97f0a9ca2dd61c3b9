watchdog/core: Add watchdog_thresh command line parameter

The hard and soft lockup detector threshold has a default value of 10
seconds which can only be changed via sysctl.

During early boot lockup detection can trigger when noisy debugging emits
a large amount of messages to the console, but there is no way to set a
larger threshold on the kernel command line. The detector can only be
completely disabled.

Add a new watchdog_thresh= command line parameter to allow boot time
control over the threshold. It works in the same way as the sysctl and
affects both the soft and the hard lockup detectors.
