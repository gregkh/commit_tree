IB/hfi1: Add a function to build TID RDMA ACK packet

This patch adds a function to build TID RDMA ACJ packet, which is also
in the KDETH PSN space for packet ordering. This packet is used to
acknowledge the receiving of all the TID RDMA WRITE DATA packets
before the given KDETH PSN. Similar to RC ACK packets, TID RDMA ACK
packets could also be coalesced.
