net: sched: extend proto ops to support unlocked classifiers

Add 'rtnl_held' flag to tcf proto change, delete, destroy, dump, walk
functions to track rtnl lock status. Extend users of these function in cls
API to propagate rtnl lock status to them. This allows classifiers to
obtain rtnl lock when necessary and to pass rtnl lock status to extensions
and driver offload callbacks.

Add flags field to tcf proto ops. Add flag value to indicate that
classifier doesn't require rtnl lock.
