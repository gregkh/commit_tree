bus: fsl-mc: automatically add a device_link on fsl_mc_[portal,object]_allocate

Allocatable devices can be acquired by drivers on the fsl-mc bus using
the fsl_mc_portal_allocate or fsl_mc_object_allocate functions. Add a
device link between the consumer device and the supplier device so that
proper resource management is achieved.
Also, adding a link between these devices ensures that a proper unbind
order is respected (ie before the supplier device is unbound from its
respective driver all consumer devices will be notified and unbound
first).
