locking/lockdep: Provide enum lock_usage_bit mask names

It makes the code more self-explanatory and tells throughout the code
what magic number refers to:

 - state (Hardirq/Softirq)
 - direction (used in or enabled above state)
 - read or write

We can even remove some comments that were compensating for the lack of
those constant names.
