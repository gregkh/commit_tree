ALSA: hda: add register offset for stripe control

bits 16:17 in SD_CTL register refer to stripe control. Added an
offset register(AZX_REG_SD_CTL_3B) to have exclusive read/write
of corresponding register byte. This helps to avoid unnecessary
32-bit read/write of SD_CTL whenever only stripe or other bits of
corresponding byte need to be updated. Also HD audio spec defines
SD_CTL as 3 byte register.

SD_CTL_STRIPE_MASK(0x3) can be used for stripe control programming
and when updating AZX_REG_SD_CTL_3B.
