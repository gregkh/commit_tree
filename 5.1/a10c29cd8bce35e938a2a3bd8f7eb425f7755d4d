doc: translations: sync translations 'remove info about -git patches'

Synchonise translations: CN, IT, JP, KR

commit 2c71d305caf9 ("docs: process: Remove outdated info about -git patches")

I can guarantee for the Italian translations, but since we are removing
an entire chapter I think I did it right also for the other languages.
