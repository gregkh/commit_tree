drm/dp_mst: Remove port validation in drm_dp_atomic_find_vcpi_slots()

Since we now have an easy way of refcounting drm_dp_mst_port structs and
safely accessing their contents, there isn't any good reason to keep
validating ports here. It doesn't prevent us from performing modesets on
branch devices that have been removed either, and we already disallow
enabling new displays on unregistered connectors in
update_connector_routing() in drm_atomic_check_modeset(). All it does is
cause us to have to make weird special exceptions in our atomic
modesetting code. So, get rid of it entirely.
