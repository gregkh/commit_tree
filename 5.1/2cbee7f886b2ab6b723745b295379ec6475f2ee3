spi: stm32: fix DMA configuration with only one channel

When SPI driver is configured to work only with TX or RX DMA channel
then dmaengine functions can dereferene NULL pointer.

Running full-duplex mode when when only RX or TX DMA channel is
available can cause overrun condition or incorrect writing to transmit
buffer so disable this types of DMA configuration and go back to
interrupt mode.
