ASoC: soc-core: add soc_cleanup_component()

We need to cleanup component when soc_probe_component() was
failed, or when soc_remove_component() was called.
But they are cleanuping component on each way.
(And soc_probe_component() doesn't call snd_soc_dapm_free(),
but it should).
Same code in many places makes code un-understandable.

This patch adds new soc_cleanup_component() and call it from
snd_probe_component() and snd_remove_component().
