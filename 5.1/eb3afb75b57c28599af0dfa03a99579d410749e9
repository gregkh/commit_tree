nvme: cancel request synchronously

nvme_cancel_request() is used in error handler, and it is always
reliable to cancel request synchronously, and avoids possible race
in which request may be completed after real hw queue is destroyed.

One issue is reported by our customer on NVMe RDMA, in which freed ib
queue pair may be used in nvme_rdma_complete_rq().
