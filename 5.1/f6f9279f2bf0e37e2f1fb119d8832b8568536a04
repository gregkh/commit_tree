misc: fastrpc: Add Qualcomm fastrpc basic driver model

This patch adds basic driver model for Qualcomm FastRPC driver which
implements an IPC (Inter-Processor Communication) mechanism that
allows for clients to transparently make remote method invocations
across processor boundaries.

Each DSP rpmsg channel is represented as fastrpc channel context and
is exposed as a character device for userspace interface.
Each compute context bank is represented as fastrpc-session-context,
which are dynamically managed by the channel context char device.
