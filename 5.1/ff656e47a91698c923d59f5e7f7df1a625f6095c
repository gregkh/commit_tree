Pinctrl: Ingenic: Fix bugs caused by differences between JZ4770 and JZ4780.

Delete uart4 and i2c3/4 from JZ4770:
According to the datasheet, only JZ4780 have uart4 and i2c3/4. So we
remove it from the JZ4770 code and add a section corresponding the JZ4780.

Fix bugs in i2c0/1:
The pin number was wrong in the original code.

Fix bugs in uart2:
JZ4770 and JZ4780 have different uart2 pins. So the original section JZ4770
has been modified and the corresponding section of JZ4780 has been added.

Fix bugs in mmc0:
JZ4770 and JZ4780 assigned different pins to mmc0's 4~7 data lines. So the
original section JZ4770 has been modified and the corresponding section of
JZ4780 has been added.

Fix bugs in mmc1:
JZ4770's mmc1 has 8bit mode, while JZ4780 doesn't. So the original
section JZ4770 has been modified and the corresponding section of
JZ4780 has been added.

Fix bugs in nemc:
JZ4770's nemc has 16bit mode, while JZ4780 doesn't. So the original section
JZ4770 has been modified and the corresponding section of JZ4780 has been
added. And add missing cs2~5 groups for JZ4770 and JZ4780.

Fix bugs in cim:
JZ4770's cim has 12bit mode, while JZ4780 doesn't. So the original
section JZ4770 has been modified and the corresponding section of
JZ4780 has been added.

Fix bugs in lcd:
Both JZ4770 and JZ4780 lcd should be 24bit instead of 32bit.
