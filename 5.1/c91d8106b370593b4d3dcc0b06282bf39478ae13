LSM: Add all exclusive LSMs to ordered initialization

This removes CONFIG_DEFAULT_SECURITY in favor of the explicit ordering
offered by CONFIG_LSM and adds all the exclusive LSMs to the ordered
LSM initialization. The old meaning of CONFIG_DEFAULT_SECURITY is now
captured by which exclusive LSM is listed first in the LSM order. All
LSMs not added to the ordered list are explicitly disabled.
