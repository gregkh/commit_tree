mtd: spi-nor: split s25fl128s into s25fl128s0 and s25fl128s1

Due to two different versions (S25FL128SAGBHI200 and S25FL128SAGBHI210) of
the s25fl128s qspi memory, the single "s25fl128s" device entry must be
split into two to match the correct JEDEC ID's for each version. Solves
paging related issues of S25FL128SAGBHI210 chips.
