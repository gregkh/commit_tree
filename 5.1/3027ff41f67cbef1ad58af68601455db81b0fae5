net: sched: route: don't set arg->stop in route4_walk() when empty

Some classifiers set arg->stop in their implementation of tp->walk() API
when empty. Most of classifiers do not adhere to that convention. Do not
set arg->stop in route4_walk() to unify tp->walk() behavior among
classifier implementations.
