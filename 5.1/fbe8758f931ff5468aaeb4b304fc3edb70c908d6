Revert "ARM: dts: nomadik: Fix polarity of SPI CS"

This reverts commit fa9463564e77067df81b0b8dec91adbbbc47bfb4.

Per Linus Walleij:

Dear ARM SoC maintainers,

can you please revert this patch. It was the wrong solution to the
wrong problem, and I must have acted in stress. Andrey fixed the
real bug in a proper way in these commits:

commit e5545c94e43b8f6599ffc01df8d1aedf18ee912a
"gpio: of: Check propname before applying "cs-gpios" quirks"
commit 7ce40277bf848391705011ba37eac2e377cbd9e6
"gpio: of: Check for "spi-cs-high" in child instead of parent node"
