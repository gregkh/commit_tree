fs: add an iopoll method to struct file_operations

This new methods is used to explicitly poll for I/O completion for an
iocb.  It must be called for any iocb submitted asynchronously (that
is with a non-null ki_complete) which has the IOCB_HIPRI flag set.

The method is assisted by a new ki_cookie field in struct iocb to store
the polling cookie.
