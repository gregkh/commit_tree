rtlwifi: rtl8188de: Remove CamelCase variables

If a macro is in CamelCase, it it converted to upper case. Variables
and routine names are converted to lower case.

The following checkpatch exceptions are also fixed:

CHECK: No space is necessary after a cast
#211: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi/rtl8192de/hw.c:109:
+                                             (u8 *) (&rfstate));

CHECK: No space is necessary after a cast
#241: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi/rtl8192de/hw.c:277:
+                               ptmp_byte = (u8 *) (&regtoset) + index;

Note that not all checkpatch exceptions are addressed. Those will be
handled in later patches.
