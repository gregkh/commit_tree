KVM: VMX: Update VMCS.HOST_RSP via helper C function

Providing a helper function to update HOST_RSP is visibly easier to
read, and more importantly (for the future) eliminates two arguments to
the VM-Enter assembly blob.  Reducing the number of arguments to the asm
blob is for all intents and purposes a prerequisite to moving the code
to a proper assembly routine.  It's not truly mandatory, but it greatly
simplifies the future code, and the cost of the extra CALL+RET is
negligible in the grand scheme.

Note that although _ASM_ARG[1-3] can be used in the inline asm itself,
the intput/output constraints need to be manually defined.  gcc will
actually compile with _ASM_ARG[1-3] specified as constraints, but what
it actually ends up doing with the bogus constraint is unknown.
