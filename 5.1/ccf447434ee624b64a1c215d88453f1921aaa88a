KVM: VMX: Manually load RDX in vCPU-run asm blob

Load RDX with the VMCS.HOST_RSP field encoding on-demand instead of
delegating to the compiler via an input constraint.  In addition to
saving one whole MOV instruction, this allows RDX to be properly
clobbered (in a future patch) instead of being saved/loaded to/from
the stack.

Despite nested_vmx_check_vmentry_hw() having similar code, leave it
alone, for now.  In that case, RDX is unconditionally used and isn't
clobbered, i.e. sending in HOST_RSP as an input is simpler.

Note that because HOST_RSP is an enum and not a define, it must be
redefined as an immediate instead of using __stringify(HOST_RSP).  The
naming "conflict" between host_rsp and HOST_RSP is slightly confusing,
but the former will be removed in a future patch, at which point
HOST_RSP is absolutely what is desired.
