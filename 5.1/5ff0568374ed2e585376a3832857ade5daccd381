KVM: x86/mmu: Remove is_obsolete() call

Unwinding usage of is_obsolete() is a step towards removing x86's fast
invalidate mechanism, i.e. this is one part of a revert all patches from
the series that introduced the mechanism[1].

This is a partial revert of commit 05988d728dcd ("KVM: MMU: reduce
KVM_REQ_MMU_RELOAD when root page is zapped").
