printk: Add caller information to printk() output.

Sometimes we want to print a series of printk() messages to consoles
without being disturbed by concurrent printk() from interrupts and/or
other threads. But we can't enforce printk() callers to use their local
buffers because we need to ask them to make too much changes. Also, even
buffering up to one line inside printk() might cause failing to emit
an important clue under critical situation.

Therefore, instead of trying to help buffering, let's try to help
reconstructing messages by saving caller information as of calling
log_store() and adding it as "[T$thread_id]" or "[C$processor_id]"
upon printing to consoles.

Some examples for console output:

  [    1.222773][    T1] x86: Booting SMP configuration:
  [    2.779635][    T1] pci 0000:00:01.0: PCI bridge to [bus 01]
  [    5.069193][  T268] Fusion MPT base driver 3.04.20
  [    9.316504][    C2] random: fast init done
  [   13.413336][ T3355] Initialized host personality

Some examples for /dev/kmsg output:

  6,496,1222773,-,caller=T1;x86: Booting SMP configuration:
  6,968,2779635,-,caller=T1;pci 0000:00:01.0: PCI bridge to [bus 01]
   SUBSYSTEM=pci
   DEVICE=+pci:0000:00:01.0
  6,1353,5069193,-,caller=T268;Fusion MPT base driver 3.04.20
  5,1526,9316504,-,caller=C2;random: fast init done
  6,1575,13413336,-,caller=T3355;Initialized host personality

Note that this patch changes max length of messages which can be printed
by printk() or written to /dev/kmsg interface from 992 bytes to 976 bytes,
based on an assumption that userspace won't try to write messages hitting
that border line to /dev/kmsg interface.
