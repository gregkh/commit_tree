net/mlx5: E-Switch, Fix access to invalid memory when toggling esw modes

The esw fdb table has a union of legacy and offloads members.
So if we were in a certain esw mode we could set some memebers and not
set null which is fine as on destroy path and don't care.
But then moving from legacy to switchdev a second time, the cleanup flow
of legacy mode checks if a struct member was in use if it's not null so
we need to make sure to reset the code to null when we init legacy mode.
