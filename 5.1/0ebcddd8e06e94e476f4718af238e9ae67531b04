Bluetooth: hci_qca: Add delay after power-off pulse

During initialization the power-on pulse is currently sent inmediately
after the prior power-off pulse. With this initialization often fails
at boot time:

[   15.205224] Bluetooth: hci0: setting up wcn3990
[   17.341062] Bluetooth: hci0: command 0xfc00 tx timeout
[   22.101453] ERROR: Bluetooth initialization failed
[   25.337740] Bluetooth: hci0: Reading QCA version information failed (-110)

After a power-off pulse wait 10ms to give the controller time to power
off. Remove the previous short settling delay, it isn't needed anymore.
