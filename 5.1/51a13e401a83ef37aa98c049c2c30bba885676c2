ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Add quirks for ASUS MeMO Pad 7 (ME176C)

Add quirks to select the correct input map, jack-detect options
and channel map to make sound work on the ASUS MeMO Pad 7 (ME176C).

Note: Although sound works out of the box, jack detection currently
requires overriding the ACPI DSDT table. This is necessary because
the rt5640 ACPI device (10EC5640) has the wrong GPIO listed as
interrupt (one of the Bluetooth GPIOs).
The correct GPIO is GPO2 0x0004 (listed as the first GPIO in the
Intel(R) Audio Machine Driver - AMCR0F28 device).
