devlink: Add support for direct reporter health state update

It is possible that a reporter state will be updated due to a recover flow
which is not triggered by a devlink health related operation, but as a side
effect of some other operation in the system.

Expose devlink health API for a direct update of a reporter status.

Move devlink_health_reporter_state enum definition to devlink.h so it could
be used from drivers as a parameter of devlink_health_reporter_state_update.

In addition, add trace_devlink_health_reporter_state_update to provide user
notification for reporter state change.
