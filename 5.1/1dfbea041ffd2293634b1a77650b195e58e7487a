drm/i915/breadcrumbs: Drop assertion that we've already enabled irqs

The motivation for introducing the check that we only enable breadcrumb
irqs if the device's irq was installed was once upon a time we waited
during suspend after disabling interrupts (which was quite slow until
the bug was discovered). Since then we have the notion of pinning the
breadcrumb irq, broadening it from the sole purpose of user interrupt
notification and waiting, and more importantly decoupling it from a very
defined time period during which enabling the irq was expected. So stop
insisting the irq is installed before we setup our IMR masks, if the IER
isn't yet enabled, nothing will happen and we will timeout instead,
revealing the lack of irq in the hang debug messages.
