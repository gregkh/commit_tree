staging: comedi: ni_usb6501: Fix possible double-free of ->usb_rx_buf

`ni6501_alloc_usb_buffers()` is called from `ni6501_auto_attach()` to
allocate RX and TX buffers for USB transfers.  It allocates
`devpriv->usb_rx_buf` followed by `devpriv->usb_tx_buf`.  If the
allocation of `devpriv->usb_tx_buf` fails, it frees
`devpriv->usb_rx_buf`, leaving the pointer set dangling, and returns an
error.  Later, `ni6501_detach()` will be called from the core comedi
module code to clean up.  `ni6501_detach()` also frees both
`devpriv->usb_rx_buf` and `devpriv->usb_tx_buf`, but
`devpriv->usb_rx_buf` may have already beed freed, leading to a
double-free error.  Fix it bu removing the call to
`kfree(devpriv->usb_rx_buf)` from `ni6501_alloc_usb_buffers()`, relying
on `ni6501_detach()` to free the memory.
