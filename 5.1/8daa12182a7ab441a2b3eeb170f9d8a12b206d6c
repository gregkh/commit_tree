drm/amd/display: Use memset to initialize variables in fill_plane_dcc_attributes

Clang warns:

drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm.c:2314:38:
warning: suggest braces around initialization of subobject
[-Wmissing-braces]
        struct dc_surface_dcc_cap output = {0};
                                            ^
                                            {}

Previous efforts to fix this type of warning by adding or removing
braces have been met with some pushback in favor of using memset [1][2].
Do that here, mirroring commit 05794eff1aa6 ("drm/amdgpu/gmc: fix
compiler errors [-Werror,-Wmissing-braces] (V2)") in this tree.
