selftests/bpf: use __bpf_constant_htons in test_prog.c for flow dissector

Older GCC (<4.8) isn't smart enough to optimize !__builtin_constant_p()
branch in bpf_htons.

I recently fixed it for pkt_v4 and pkt_v6 in commit a0517a0f7ef23
("selftests/bpf: use __bpf_constant_htons in test_prog.c"), but
later added another bunch of bpf_htons in commit bf0f0fd939451
("selftests/bpf: add simple BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN examples for flow
dissector").

Fixes: bf0f0fd939451 ("selftests/bpf: add simple BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN examples for flow dissector")
