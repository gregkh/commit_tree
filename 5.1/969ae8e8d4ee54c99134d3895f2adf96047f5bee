cifs: Accept validate negotiate if server return NT_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED

Old windows version or Netapp SMB server will return
NT_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED since they do not allow or implement
FSCTL_VALIDATE_NEGOTIATE_INFO. The client should accept the response
provided it's properly signed.

See

and

Samba client had already handled it.
