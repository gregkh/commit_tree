xfs: zero initialize highstale and lowstale in xfs_dir2_leaf_addname

Smatch complains about the following:

fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_dir2_leaf.c:848 xfs_dir2_leaf_addname() error:
uninitialized symbol 'lowstale'.

fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_dir2_leaf.c:849 xfs_dir2_leaf_addname() error:
uninitialized symbol 'highstale'.

I don't think there's any incorrect behavior associated with the
uninitialized variable, but as the author of the previous zero-init
patch points out, it's best not to be passing around pointers to
uninitialized stack areas.
