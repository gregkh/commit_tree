epoll: unify awaking of wakeup source on ep_poll_callback() path

Original comment "Activate ep->ws since epi->ws may get deactivated at
any time" indeed sounds loud, but it is incorrect, because the path
where we check epi->ws is a path where insert to ovflist happens, i.e.
ep_scan_ready_list() has taken ep->mtx and waits for this callback to
finish, thus ep_modify() (which unregisters wakeup source) waits for
ep_scan_ready_list().

Here in this patch I simply call ep_pm_stay_awake_rcu(), which is a bit
extra for this path (indirectly protected by main ep->mtx, so even rcu
is not needed), but I do not want to create another naked
__ep_pm_stay_awake() variant only for this particular case, so rcu variant
is just better for all the cases.
