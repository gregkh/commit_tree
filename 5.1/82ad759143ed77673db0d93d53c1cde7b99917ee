ASoC: tlv320aic3x: fix reset gpio reference counting

This patch fixes a bug that prevents freeing the reset gpio on unloading
the module.

aic3x_i2c_probe is called when loading the module and it calls list_add
with a probably uninitialized list entry aic3x->list (next = prev = NULL)).
So even if list_del is called it does nothing and in the end the gpio_reset
is not freed. Then a repeated module probing fails silently because
gpio_request fails.

When moving INIT_LIST_HEAD to aic3x_i2c_probe we also have to move
list_del to aic3x_i2c_remove because aic3x_remove may be called
multiple times without aic3x_i2c_remove being called which leads to
a NULL pointer dereference.
