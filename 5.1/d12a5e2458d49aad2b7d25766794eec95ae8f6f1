habanalabs: fix mapping with page size bigger than 4KB

This patch fixes the mapping of virtual address to physical addresses on
architectures where PAGE_SIZE is bigger than 4KB.
The break down to the device page size was done only for the virtual
address while it should have been done for the physical address as well.
As a result virtual addresses were mapped to wrong physical address.
The fix is to apply the break down for the physical addresses as well in
order to get correct mappings.
