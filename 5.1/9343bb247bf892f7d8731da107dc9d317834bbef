drm/i915: Don't use DDB allocation when choosing gen9 watermark method

The bspec gives an if/else chain for choosing whether to use "method 1"
or "method 2" for calculating the watermark "Selected Result Blocks"
value for a plane.  One of the branches of the if chain is:

        "Else If ('plane buffer allocation' is known and (plane buffer
        allocation / plane blocks per line) >=1)"

Since our driver currently calculates DDB allocations first and the
actual watermark values second, the plane buffer allocation is known at
this point in our code and we include this test in our driver's logic.
However we plan to soon move to a "watermarks first, ddb allocation
second" sequence where we won't know the DDB allocation at this point.
Let's drop this arm of the if/else statement (effectively considering
the DDB allocation unknown) as an independent patch so that any
regressions can be more accurately bisected to either the different
watermark value (in this patch) or the new DDB allocation (in the next
patch).
