perf cs-etm: Set sample flags for trace discontinuity

In the middle of trace stream, it might be interrupted thus the trace
data is not continuous, the trace stream firstly is ended for previous
trace block and restarted for next block.

To display related information for showing trace is restarted, this
patch set sample flags for trace discontinuity:

- If one discontinuity packet is coming, append flag
  PERF_IP_FLAG_TRACE_END to the previous packet to indicate the trace
  has been ended;
- If one instruction packet is following discontinuity packet, this
  instruction packet is the first one packet to restarting trace.  So
  set flag PERF_IP_FLAG_TRACE_START to discontinuity packet, this flag
  will be used to generate sample when connect with the sequential
  instruction packet.
