perf report: Support builtin perf script in scripts menu

The scripts menu traditionally only showed custom perf scripts.

Allow to run standard perf script with useful default options too.

- Normal perf script
- perf script with assembler (needs xed installed)
- perf script with source code output (needs debuginfo)
- perf script with custom arguments

Then we automatically select the right options to display the
information in the perf.data file.

For example with -b display branch contexts.

It's not easily possible to check for xed's existence in advance.  perf
script usually gives sensible error messages when it's not available.
