afs: avoid deprecated get_seconds()

get_seconds() has a limited range on 32-bit architectures and is
deprecated because of that. While AFS uses the same limits for
its inode timestamps on the wire protocol, let's just use the
simpler current_time() as we do for other file systems.

This will still zero out the 'tv_nsec' field of the timestamps
internally.
