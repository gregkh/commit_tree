cfg80211: Use const more consistently in for_each_element macros

Enforce the first argument to be a correct type of a pointer to struct
element and avoid unnecessary typecasts from const to non-const pointers
(the change in validate_ie_attr() is needed to make this part work). In
addition, avoid signed/unsigned comparison within for_each_element() and
mark struct element packed just in case.
