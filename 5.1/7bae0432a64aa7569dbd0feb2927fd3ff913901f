usb: core: add option of only authorizing internal devices

On Chrome OS we want to use USBguard to potentially limit access to USB
devices based on policy. We however to do not want to wait for userspace to
come up before initializing fixed USB devices to not regress our boot
times.

This patch adds option to instruct the kernel to only authorize devices
connected to the internal ports. Previously we could either authorize
all or none (or, by default, we'd only authorize wired devices).

The behavior is controlled via usbcore.authorized_default command line
option.
