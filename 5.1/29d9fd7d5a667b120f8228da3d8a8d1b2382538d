net/mlx5: E-Switch, Support load/unload reps of specific vport types

Currently the driver loads and unloads all reps in an unbreakable
group. However, with ECPF, the reps of special vports such as uplink
and host PF should always be loaded in switchdev mode where the reps
for VFs will be loaded on-demand and unloaded on no-demand. This is
a pre-step for that change.

This patch doesn't change any functionality.
