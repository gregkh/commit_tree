tty: xilinx_uartps: Correct return value in probe

Existing driver checks for alternate clock if devm_clk_get() fails
and returns error code for last clock failure. If xilinx_uartps is
called before clock driver, devm_clk_get() returns -EPROBE_DEFER.
In this case, probe should not check for alternate clock as main
clock is already present in DTS and return -EPROBE_DEFER only.

This patch fixes it by not checking for alternate clock when main
clock get returns -EPROBE_DEFER.
