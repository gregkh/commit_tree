clk: meson: meson8b: add the GPU clock tree

Add the GPU clock tree on Meson8, Meson8b and Meson8m2.

The GPU clock tree on Meson8b and Meson8m2 is almost identical to the
one one GXBB:
- there's a glitch-free mux at HHI_MALI_CLK_CNTL[31]
- there are two identical parents for this mux: mali_0 and mali_1, each
  with a gate, divider and mux
- the parents of mali_0_sel and mali_1_sel are identical to GXBB except
  there's no GP0_PLL on these 32-bit SoCs

Meson8 is different because it does not have the glitch-free mux.
Instead if only has the mali_0 clock tree. The parents of mali_0_sel are
identical to the ones on Meson8b and Meson8m2.
