IB/hfi1: TID RDMA flow allocation

The hfi1 hardware flow is a hardware flow-control mechanism for a KDETH
data packet that is received on a hfi1 port. It validates the packet by
checking both the generation and sequence. Each QP that uses the TID RDMA
mechanism will allocate a hardware flow from its receiving context for
any incoming KDETH data packets.

This patch implements:
(1) a function to allocate hardware flow
(2) a function to free hardware flow
(3) a function to initialize hardware flow generation for a receiving
    context
(4) a wait mechanism if the hardware flow is not available
(4) a function to remove the qp from the wait queue for hardware flow
    when the qp is reset or destroyed.
