gpio: mockup: rework debugfs interface

Modify the way the debugfs interface works in gpio-mockup. Introduce
the concept of dummy pull config which will keep the mockup lines in
known state. The pull values can be modified by writing to the debugfs
files corresponding to lines. Lines in input mode always report the
current pull value, lines in output mode change the line value but
it will revert back to the one specified by current pull when released.
