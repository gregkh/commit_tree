iwlwifi: differentiate between alive timeout and alive flow failure

There are two cases that can cause the alive flow to fail,
an assert or a timeout.
Currently we mask any incoming asserts when we wait for alive.

Solve this by differentiating between the two cases:
1. Let the regular error handling to handle a received assert
2. Do a dump collection in the case of a timeout
