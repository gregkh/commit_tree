leds: trigger: pattern: Add pattern initialization from Device Tree

Allow initialization of pattern used in pattern trigger from Device Tree
property.

This is especially useful for embedded systems where the pattern trigger
would be used to indicate the process of boot status in a nice,
user-friendly blinking way.  This initialization pattern will be used
till user-space is brought up and sets its own pattern, indicating the
boot status is for example finished.
