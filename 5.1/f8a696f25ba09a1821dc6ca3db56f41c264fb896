sched/core: Give DCE a fighting chance

All that fancy new Energy-Aware scheduling foo is hidden behind a
static_key, which is awesome if you have the stuff enabled in your
config.

However, when you lack all the prerequisites it doesn't make any sense
to pretend we'll ever actually run this, so provide a little more clue
to the compiler so it can more agressively delete the code.
