s390: fix system call tracing

When converting to autogenerated compat syscall wrappers all system
call entry points got a different symbol name: they all got a __s390x_
prefix.

This caused breakage with system call tracing, since an appropriate
arch_syscall_match_sym_name() was not provided. Add this function, and
while at it also add code to avoid compat system call tracing. s390
has different system call tables for native 64 bit system calls and
compat system calls. This isn't really supported in the common
code. However there are hardly any compat binaries left, therefore
just ignore compat system calls, like x86 and arm64 also do for the
same reason.
