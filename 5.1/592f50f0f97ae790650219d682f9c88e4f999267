ARM: dts: bcm2835-rpi: Drop unnecessary #address-cells/#size-cells

Compiling the bcm2835-rpi.dtsi with W=1 leads to the following warning:

Warning (avoid_unnecessary_addr_size): /soc/firmware: unnecessary
 #address-cells/#size-cells without "ranges" or child "reg" property

Fix this by removing these unnecessary properties.
