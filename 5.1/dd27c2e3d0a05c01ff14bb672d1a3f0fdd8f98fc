bpf: offload: add priv field for drivers

Currently bpf_offload_dev does not have any priv pointer, forcing
the drivers to work backwards from the netdev in program metadata.
This is not great given programs are conceptually associated with
the offload device, and it means one or two unnecessary deferences.
Add a priv pointer to bpf_offload_dev.
