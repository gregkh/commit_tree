watchdog/core: Make variables static

sparse complains:
  CHECK   kernel/watchdog.c
kernel/watchdog.c:45:19: warning: symbol 'nmi_watchdog_available'
			 	  was not declared. Should it be static?
kernel/watchdog.c:47:16: warning: symbol 'watchdog_allowed_mask'
			 	  was not declared. Should it be static?

They're not referenced by name from anyplace else, make them static.
