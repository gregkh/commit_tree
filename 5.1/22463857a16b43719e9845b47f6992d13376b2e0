iwlwifi: receive umac and lmac error table addresses from TLVs

TLV 54 holds umac debug related addresses.
TLV 55 holds lmac debug related addresses.
These TLVs aim to replace the alive notification data in the future.

Parse and keep error table addresses received from the TLVs
for both lmac and umac and use these addresses instead of the pointer
received from alive notification.

The feature supports only unified image.
