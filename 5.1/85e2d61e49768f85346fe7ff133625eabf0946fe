drm/i915: Validate userspace-provided color management LUT's (v4)

We currently program userspace-provided gamma and degamma LUT's into our
hardware without really checking to see whether they satisfy our
hardware's rules.  We should try to catch tables that are invalid for
our hardware early and reject the atomic transaction.

All of our platforms that accept a degamma LUT expect that the entries
in the LUT are always flat or increasing, never decreasing.  Also, our
GLK and ICL platforms only accept degamma tables with r=g=b entries; so
we should also add the relevant checks for that in anticipation of
degamma support landing for those platforms.

v2:
 - Use new API (single check function with bitmask of tests to apply)
 - Call helper for our gamma table as well (with no additional tests
   specified) so that the table size will be validated.

v3:
 - Don't call on the gamma table since the LUT size is already tested at
   property blob upload and we don't have any additional hardware
   constraints for that LUT.

v4:
 - Apply equal color channel check on gen10 as well; the bspec has some
   strange tagging for CNL platforms, but this appears to apply there as
   well.  (Ville)
