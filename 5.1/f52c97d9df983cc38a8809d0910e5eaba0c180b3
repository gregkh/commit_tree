bpf, doc: fix BTF docs reflow of bullet list

Section 2.2.1 BTF_KIND_INT a bullet list was collapsed due to
text reflow in commit 9ab5305dbe3f ("docs/btf: reflow text to
fill up to 78 characters").

This patch correct the mistake. Also adjust next bullet list,
which is used for comparison, to get rendered the same way.
