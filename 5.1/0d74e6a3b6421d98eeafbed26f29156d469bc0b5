dm integrity: change memcmp to strncmp in dm_integrity_ctr

If the string opt_string is small, the function memcmp can access bytes
that are beyond the terminating nul character. In theory, it could cause
segfault, if opt_string were located just below some unmapped memory.

Change from memcmp to strncmp so that we don't read bytes beyond the end
of the string.
