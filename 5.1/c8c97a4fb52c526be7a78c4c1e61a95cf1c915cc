rtc: isl1208: fix negative digital trim reporting

isl1208_i2c_get_dtr() was returning the dtr value directly, but could
also return a negative error code.  Negative trimming values, e.g. -20,
would get interpreted as an error code, e.g. -ENOTDIR.

This patch offsets the dtr value by 100 so it's positive and won't alias
an error code.

Also fix check that considered a return value of -1 to be success.
