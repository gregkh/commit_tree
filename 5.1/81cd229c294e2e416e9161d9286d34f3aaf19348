net/mlx5: E-Switch, Consider ECPF vport depends on eswitch ownership

ECPF connects to the eswitch through vport 0xfffe. ECPF may or may
not be the eswitch manager depending on firmware configuration.

1. If ECPF is eswitch manager: ECPF will take over the eswitch manager
   responsibility. A rep of the host PF shall be created at the ECPF
   side for the eswitch manager to control.

2. If ECPF is not eswitch manager: host PF will be the eswitch manager,
   ECPF acts similar as a VF to the host PF. Host PF will be aware
   of the ECPF vport presence and control it's rep.
