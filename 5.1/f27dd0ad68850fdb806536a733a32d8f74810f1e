media: seco-cec: fix RC_CORE dependency

All other drivers that need RC_CORE have a dependency rather than using
'select', so we should do the same here to avoid circular dependencies
as well as this warning about missing dependencies:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for RC_CORE
  Depends on [n]: INPUT [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - VIDEO_SECO_RC [=y] && MEDIA_SUPPORT [=y] && CEC_PLATFORM_DRIVERS [=y] && VIDEO_SECO_CEC [=y]
