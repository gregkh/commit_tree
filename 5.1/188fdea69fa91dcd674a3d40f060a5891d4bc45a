powerpc/eeh: remove sw_state from eeh_unfreeze_pe()

eeh_unfreeze_pe() performs two operations: unfreezing a PE (which may
cause firmware to unfreeze child PEs as well) and de-isolating the PE
and it's children.

To simplify this and support future work, separate out the
de-isolation and perform it at the call sites (when necessary).

There should be no change in behaviour.
