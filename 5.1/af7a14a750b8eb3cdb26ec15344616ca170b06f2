perf tools: Add doc about how to build perf with Asan and UBSan

AddressSanitizer (or ASan) and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (or UBSan) are
very useful tools to detect program bugs:

 - AddressSanitizer (or ASan) is a GCC feature that detects memory
   corruption bugs such as buffer overflows and memory leaks.

 - UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (or UBSan) is a fast undefined behavior
   detector supported by GCC. UBSan detects undefined behaviors of programs
   at runtime.

This patch adds a document about how to use them on perf. Later patches will fix
some of the issues disclosed by them.
