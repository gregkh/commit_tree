So we have a situation where we do not pull in <linux/types.h>
when building for alpha and for ia64 we need even more definitions
are required.

Two invasive fixes where considered:
- Change all declarations of arch_irqs_disabled_flags() to use bool
- Add include of <linux/types.h> to all files that uses bool for
  arch_irqs_disabled_flags

To invasive with a too high pain/benefit ratio, so dropped.
They would not cover ia64 either.

Some less invasive fixes was also considered:
- Add include of <linux/types.h> to drm_util.h
- Add include of <linux/interrupt.h> to drm_util.h

The first was dropped as this did not cover the ia64 case.

The latter was considered the best option as there could
be other similar cases and we would like the header files below
include/drm/ to be selfcontained.
So we end up pulling in a lot of stuff not needed, but this is
the price we pay in drm/ because the kernel headers are not all
selfcontained.

While at it, ordred the includefiles in drm_util in alphabetical order.

Build tested with alpha,ia64,arm,x86 with allmodconfig and allyesconfig.

v2:
- fix ia64 build, changed to include interrupt.h
- sort include files alphabetically
