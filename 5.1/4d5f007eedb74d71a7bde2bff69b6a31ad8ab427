time: make adjtime compat handling available for 32 bit

We want to reuse the compat_timex handling on 32-bit architectures the
same way we are using the compat handling for timespec when moving to
64-bit time_t.

Move all definitions related to compat_timex out of the compat code
into the normal timekeeping code, along with a rename to old_timex32,
corresponding to the timespec/timeval structures, and make it controlled
by CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME, which 32-bit architectures will then select.
