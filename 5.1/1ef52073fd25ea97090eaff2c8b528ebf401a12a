powerpc/eeh: Improve recovery of passed-through devices

Currently, the EEH recovery process considers passed-through devices
as if they were not EEH-aware, which can cause them to be removed as
part of recovery.  Because device removal requires cooperation from
the guest, this may lead to the process stalling or deadlocking.
Also, if devices are removed on the host side, they will be removed
from their IOMMU group, making recovery in the guest impossible.

Therefore, alter the recovery process so that passed-through devices
are not removed but are instead left frozen (and marked isolated)
until the guest performs it's own recovery.  If firmware thaws a
passed-through PE because it's parent PE has been thawed (because it
was not passed through), re-freeze it.
