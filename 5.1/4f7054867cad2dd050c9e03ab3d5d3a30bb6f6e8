rocker: Handle SWITCHDEV_PORT_ATTR_SET

Following patches will change the way we communicate setting a port's
attribute and use notifiers towards that goal.

Prepare rocker to support receiving notifier events targeting
SWITCHDEV_PORT_ATTR_SET from both atomic and process context and use a
small helper to translate the event notifier into something that
rocker_port_attr_set() can process.
