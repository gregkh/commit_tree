mtd: rawnand: mtk: fix possible object reference leak

of_find_device_by_node() takes a reference to the struct device
when it finds a match via get_device, there is no need to call
get_device() twice.
We also should make sure to drop the reference to the device
taken by of_find_device_by_node() on driver unbind.
