fs: prevent page refcount overflow in pipe_buf_get

Change pipe_buf_get() to return a bool indicating whether it succeeded
in raising the refcount of the page (if the thing in the pipe is a page).
This removes another mechanism for overflowing the page refcount.  All
callers converted to handle a failure.
