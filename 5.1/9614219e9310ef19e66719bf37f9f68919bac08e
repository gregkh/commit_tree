HID: uclogic: Extract tablet parameter discovery into a module

Refactor and extract UC-Logic tablet initialization and parameter
discovery into a module. For these tablets, the major part of parameter
discovery cannot be separated from initialization so they have to be in
the same module. Define explicitly and clearly what possible quirks the
tablets may have to make the driver implementation easier and simpler.
