efi: Use 32-bit alignment for efi_guid_t

The UEFI spec and EDK2 reference implementation both define EFI_GUID as
struct { u32 a; u16; b; u16 c; u8 d[8]; }; and so the implied alignment
is 32 bits not 8 bits like our guid_t. In some cases (i.e., on 32-bit ARM),
this means that firmware services invoked by the kernel may assume that
efi_guid_t* arguments are 32-bit aligned, and use memory accessors that
do not tolerate misalignment. So let's set the minimum alignment to 32 bits.

Note that the UEFI spec as well as some comments in the EDK2 code base
suggest that EFI_GUID should be 64-bit aligned, but this appears to be
a mistake, given that no code seems to exist that actually enforces that
or relies on it.
