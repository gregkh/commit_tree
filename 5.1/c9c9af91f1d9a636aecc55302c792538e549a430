mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Allow to interrupt/continue rehash work

Currently, migration of vregions with many entries may take long time
during which insertions and removals of the rules are blocked
due to wait to acquire vregion->lock.

To overcome this, allow to interrupt and continue rehash work according
to the set credits - number of rules to migrate.
