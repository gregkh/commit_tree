drm/i915: Add timeline barrier support

Timeline barrier allows serialization between different timelines.

After calling i915_timeline_set_barrier with a request, all following
submissions on this timeline will be set up as depending on this request,
or barrier. Once the barrier has been completed it automatically gets
cleared and things continue as normal.

This facility will be used by the upcoming context SSEU code.

v2:
 * Assert barrier has been retired on timeline_fini. (Chris Wilson)
 * Fix mock_timeline.

v3:
 * Improved comment language. (Chris Wilson)

v4:
 * Maintain ordering with previous barriers set on the timeline.

v5:
 * Rebase.
