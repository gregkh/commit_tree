clk: actions: Add configurable PLL delay

S500 SoC requires configurable delay for different PLLs. Hence, add
a separate macro for declaring a PLL with configurable delay and also
modify the existing OWL_PLL_NO_PARENT macro to use default delay so
that no need to modify the existing S700/S900 drivers.
