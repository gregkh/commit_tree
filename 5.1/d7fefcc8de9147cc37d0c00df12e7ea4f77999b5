mm/cma: add PF flag to force non cma alloc

Patch series "mm/kvm/vfio/ppc64: Migrate compound pages out of CMA
region", v8.

ppc64 uses the CMA area for the allocation of guest page table (hash
page table).  We won't be able to start guest if we fail to allocate
hash page table.  We have observed hash table allocation failure because
we failed to migrate pages out of CMA region because they were pinned.
This happen when we are using VFIO.  VFIO on ppc64 pins the entire guest
RAM.  If the guest RAM pages get allocated out of CMA region, we won't
be able to migrate those pages.  The pages are also pinned for the
lifetime of the guest.

Currently we support migration of non-compound pages.  With THP and with
the addition of hugetlb migration we can end up allocating compound
pages from CMA region.  This patch series add support for migrating
compound pages.

This patch (of 4):

Add PF_MEMALLOC_NOCMA which make sure any allocation in that context is
marked non-movable and hence cannot be satisfied by CMA region.

This is useful with get_user_pages_longterm where we want to take a page
pin by migrating pages from CMA region.  Marking the section
PF_MEMALLOC_NOCMA ensures that we avoid unnecessary page migration
later.
