qed: Add infrastructure for error detection and recovery

This patch adds the detection and handling of a parity error ("process kill
event"), including the update of the protocol drivers, and the prevention
of any HW access that will lead to device access towards the host while
recovery is in progress.
It also provides the means for the protocol drivers to trigger a recovery
process on their decision.
