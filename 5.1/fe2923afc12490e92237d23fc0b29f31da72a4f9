net: sched: traverse classifiers in chain with tcf_get_next_proto()

All users of chain->filters_chain rely on rtnl lock and assume that no new
classifier instances are added when traversing the list. Use
tcf_get_next_proto() to traverse filters list without relying on rtnl
mutex. This function iterates over classifiers by taking reference to
current iterator classifier only and doesn't assume external
synchronization of filters list.
