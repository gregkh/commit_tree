dynamic_debug: refactor dynamic_pr_debug and friends

For the upcoming 'define the _ddebug descriptor in assembly', we need
all the descriptors in a translation unit to have distinct names
(because asm does not understand C scope).  The easiest way to achieve
that is as usual with an extra level of macros, passing the identifier
to use to the innermost macro, generating it via __UNIQUE_ID or
something.

However, instead of repeating that exercise for dynamic_pr_debug,
dynamic_dev_dbg, dynamic_netdev_dbg and dynamic_hex_dump separately, we
can use the similarity between their bodies to implement them via a
common macro, _dynamic_func_call - though the hex_dump case requires a
slight variant, since print_hex_dump does not take the _ddebug
descriptor.  We'll also get to use that variant elsewhere (btrfs).
