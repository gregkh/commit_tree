drm/tinydrm: Use struct drm_rect

This prepares for the switch to drm_atomic_helper_dirtyfb() in the next
patch. The damage helper returns a drm_rect so switch to that everywhere
including using a pointer in the dirty functions.

This is a non-functional change except for the debug print which looks a
bit different.
