Bluetooth: Add quirk for reading BD_ADDR from fwnode property

Add HCI_QUIRK_USE_BDADDR_PROPERTY to allow controllers to retrieve
the public Bluetooth address from the firmware node property
'local-bd-address'. If quirk is set and the property does not exist
or is invalid the controller is marked as unconfigured.
