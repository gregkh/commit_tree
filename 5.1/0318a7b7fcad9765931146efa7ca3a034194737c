net/mlx5e: Rx, Check ip headers sanity

In the two places is_last_ethertype_ip is being called, the caller will
be looking inside the ip header, to be safe, add ip{4,6} header sanity
check. And return true only on valid ip headers, i.e: the whole header
is contained in the linear part of the skb.

Note: Such situation is very rare and hard to reproduce, since mlx5e
allocates a large enough headroom to contain the largest header one can
imagine.
