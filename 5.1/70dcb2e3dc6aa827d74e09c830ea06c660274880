IB/hfi1: Add the TID second leg send packet builder

To improve performance, the TID RDMA WRITE protocol is designed to
own a second leg to send data and ack packets in the KDETH PSN space.
This patch adds the packet builder for the requester side, which
contains the state machine to build TID RDMA WRITE DATA and TID
RDMA RESYNC packet.
