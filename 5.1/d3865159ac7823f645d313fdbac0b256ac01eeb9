btrfs: zstd: ensure reclaim timer is properly cleaned up

The timer function, zstd_reclaim_timer_fn(), reschedules itself under
certain conditions. When cleaning up, take the lock and remove all
workspaces. This prevents the timer from rearming itself. Lastly, switch
to del_timer_sync() to ensure that the timer function can't trigger as
we're unloading.
