btrfs: Remove not_found_em label from btrfs_get_extent

In order to avoid duplicating init code for em there is an additional
label, not_found_em, which is used to only set ->block_start. The only
case when it will be used is if the extent we are adding overlaps with
an existing extent. Make that case more obvious by:

 1. Adding a comment hinting at what's going on
 2. Assigning EXTENT_MAP_HOLE and directly going to insert.

 No functional changes.
