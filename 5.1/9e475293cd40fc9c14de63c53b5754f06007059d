mlxsw: spectrum_router: Use struct_size() in kzalloc()

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct foo {
    int stuff;
    struct boo entry[];
};

size = sizeof(struct foo) + count * sizeof(struct boo);
instance = kzalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL)

Instead of leaving these open-coded and prone to type mistakes, we can
now use the new struct_size() helper:

instance = kzalloc(struct_size(instance, entry, count), GFP_KERNEL)

Notice that, in this case, variable alloc_size is not necessary, hence
it is removed.

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
