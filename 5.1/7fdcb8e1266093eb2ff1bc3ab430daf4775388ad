rsi: add support for hardware scan offload

With the current approach of scanning, roaming delays are observed.
Firmware has support for back ground scanning. To get this advantage,
mac80211 hardware scan is implemented, which decides type of scan to
do based on connected state.

When station is in not connected, driver returns with special value 1
to trigger software scan in mac80211. In case of connected state,
background scan will be triggered.
