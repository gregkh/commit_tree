kernel/hung_task.c: Use continuously blocked time when reporting.

Since commit a2e514453861 ("kernel/hung_task.c: allow to set checking
interval separately from timeout") added hung_task_check_interval_secs,
setting a value different from hung_task_timeout_secs

  echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_panic
  echo 120 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs
  echo 5 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_check_interval_secs

causes confusing output as if the task was blocked for
hung_task_timeout_secs seconds from the previous report.

  [  399.395930] INFO: task kswapd0:75 blocked for more than 120 seconds.
  [  405.027637] INFO: task kswapd0:75 blocked for more than 120 seconds.
  [  410.659725] INFO: task kswapd0:75 blocked for more than 120 seconds.
  [  416.292860] INFO: task kswapd0:75 blocked for more than 120 seconds.
  [  421.932305] INFO: task kswapd0:75 blocked for more than 120 seconds.

Although we could update t->last_switch_time after sched_show_task(t) if
we want to report only every 120 seconds, reporting every 5 seconds
might not be very bad for monitoring after a problematic situation has
started.  Thus, let's use continuously blocked time instead of updating
previously reported time.
