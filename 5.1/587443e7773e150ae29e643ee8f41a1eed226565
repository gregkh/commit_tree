IB/mlx4: Fix race condition between catas error reset and aliasguid flows

Code review revealed a race condition which could allow the catas error
flow to interrupt the alias guid query post mechanism at random points.
Thiis is fixed by doing cancel_delayed_work_sync() instead of
cancel_delayed_work() during the alias guid mechanism destroy flow.
