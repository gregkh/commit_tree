mm, compaction: keep cached migration PFNs synced for unusable pageblocks

Migrate has separate cached PFNs for ASYNC and SYNC* migration on the
basis that some migrations will fail in ASYNC mode.  However, if the
cached PFNs match at the start of scanning and pageblocks are skipped
due to having no isolation candidates, then the sync state does not
matter.  This patch keeps matching cached PFNs in sync until a pageblock
with isolation candidates is found.

The actual benefit is marginal given that the sync scanner following the
async scanner will often skip a number of pageblocks but it's useless
work.  Any benefit depends heavily on whether the scanners restarted
recently.
