drm/amdkfd: Optimize out sdma doorbell array in kgd2kfd_shared_resources

We can directly calculate sdma doorbell indexes in the process doorbell
pages through the doorbell_index structure in amdgpu_device, so no need
to cache them in kgd2kfd_shared_resources any more. This alleviates the
adaptation needs when new SDMA configurations are introduced.
