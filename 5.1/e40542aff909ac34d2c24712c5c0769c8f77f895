KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix build failure without IOMMU support

Currently trying to build without IOMMU support will fail:

  (.text+0x1380): undefined reference to `kvmppc_h_get_tce'
  (.text+0x1384): undefined reference to `kvmppc_rm_h_put_tce'
  (.text+0x149c): undefined reference to `kvmppc_rm_h_stuff_tce'
  (.text+0x14a0): undefined reference to `kvmppc_rm_h_put_tce_indirect'

This happens because turning off IOMMU support will prevent
book3s_64_vio_hv.c from being built because it is only built when
SPAPR_TCE_IOMMU is set, which depends on IOMMU support.

Fix it using ifdefs for the undefined references.
