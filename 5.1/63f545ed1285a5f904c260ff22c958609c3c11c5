ice: Add support for adaptive interrupt moderation

Currently the driver does not support adaptive/dynamic interrupt
moderation. This patch adds support for this. Also, adaptive/dynamic
interrupt moderation is turned on by default upon driver load.

In order to support adaptive interrupt moderation, two functions were
added, ice_update_itr() and ice_itr_divisor(). These are used to
determine the current packet load and to determine a divisor based
on link speed respectively.

This patch also adds the ICE_ITR_GRAN_S define that is used in the
hot-path when setting a new ITR value. The shift is used to pet two
birds with one hand, set the ITR value while re-enabling the
interrupt. Also, the ICE_ITR_GRAN_S is defined as 1 because the device
has a ITR granularity of 2usecs.
