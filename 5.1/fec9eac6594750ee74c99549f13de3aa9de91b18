ARM: 8822/1: smp_twd: Remove legacy TWD registration

As of commit 7484c727b636a838 ("ARM: realview: delete the RealView board
files"), the ARM Timer and Watchdog Unit is instantiated from DT only.
Moreover, the driver is selected from ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM platforms only,
which implies OF, TIMER_OF, and COMMON_CLK.

Hence remove all unused legacy infrastructure from the driver.
