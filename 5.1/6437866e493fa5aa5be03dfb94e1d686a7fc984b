net/packet: Remove redundant skb->protocol set

c72219b75f introduced tpacket_set_protocol that parses the Ethernet L2
header and sets skb->protocol if it's unset. It is no longer needed
since the introduction of packet_parse_headers. In case of SOCK_RAW and
unset skb->protocol, packet_parse_headers asks the driver to tell the
protocol number, and it's implemented for all Ethernet devices. As the
old function supported only Ethernet, no functionality is lost.
