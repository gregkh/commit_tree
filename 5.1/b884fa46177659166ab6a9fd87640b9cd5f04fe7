netfilter: conntrack: unify sysctl handling

Due to historical reasons, all l4 trackers register their own
sysctls.

This leads to copy&pasted boilerplate code, that does exactly same
thing, just with different data structure.

Place all of this in a single file.

This allows to remove the various ctl_table pointers from the ct_netns
structure and reduces overall code size.
