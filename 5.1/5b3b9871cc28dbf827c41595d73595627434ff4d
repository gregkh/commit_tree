crypto: caam - move shared symbols in a common location

There are several issues with symbols shared b/w:
-caam/jr and caam/qi drivers on one hand
-caam/qi2 driver on the other hand

Commit 52813ab24959 ("crypto: caam/qi2 - avoid double export") fixed
some of them, however compilation still fails for CRYPTO_DEV_FSL_CAAM=m
and CRYPTO_DEV_FSL_DPAA2_CAAM=y.

Another issue is related to dependency cycles reported by depmod when
CRYPTO_DEV_FSL_CAAM=n and CRYPTO_DEV_FSL_DPAA2_CAAM=m, as mentioned in
82c7b351be3f ("Revert "arm64: defconfig: Enable FSL_MC_BUS and FSL_MC_DPIO"")

To fix all these, move the symbols shared by these drivers in a common
location. The only existing possibility is error.c file (note that naming
doesn't help and should probably change).
