IB/hfi1: TID RDMA RcvArray programming and TID allocation

TID entries are used by hfi1 hardware to receive data payload from
incoming packets directly into a user buffer and thus avoid data copying
by software. This patch implements the functions for TID allocation,
freeing, and programming TID RcvArray entries in hardware for kernel
clients. TID entries are managed via lists of TID groups similar to PSM.
Furthermore, to track TID resource allocation for each request, software
flows are also allocated and freed as needed. Since software flows
consume large amount of memory for tracking TID allocation and freeing,
it is generally desirable to allocate them dynamically in the send queue
and only for TID RDMA requests, but pre-allocate them for receive queue
because the send queue could have thousands of entries while the receive
queue has only a limited number of entries.
