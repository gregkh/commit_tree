drm/i915: Don't set update_wm_post on g4x+

update_wm_post is meant for pre-g4x only. Don't ever set
it on g4x+.

The only effect of a bogus update_wm_post on g4x+ could
be that we clear the legacy_cursor_update flag in
intel_atomic_commit(). Since legacy_cursor_update is
only set for legacy cursor updates (as the name suggests)
and we only set update_wm_post for a modeset the two
cases should never occur at the same time. But let's
be consistent in setting update_wm_post so we don't
end up confusing so many people.
