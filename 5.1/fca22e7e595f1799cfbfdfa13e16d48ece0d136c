net/mlx5: ODP support for XRC transport is not enabled by default in FW

ODP support for XRC transport is not enabled by default in FW, so we need
separate ODP checks to enable/disable it.

While that, rewrite the set of ODP SRQ support capabilities in way that
tests each field separately for clearness, which is not needed for current
FW, but better to have it separated.
