tools/libbpf: support bigger BTF data sizes

While it's understandable why kernel limits number of BTF types to 65535
and size of string section to 64KB, in libbpf as user-space library it's
too restrictive. E.g., pahole converting DWARF to BTF type information
for Linux kernel generates more than 3 million BTF types and more than
3MB of strings, before deduplication. So to allow btf__dedup() to do its
work, we need to be able to load bigger BTF sections using btf__new().
