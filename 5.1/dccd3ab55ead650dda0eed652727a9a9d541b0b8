bpfilter: re-add header search paths to tools include to fix build error

I thought header search paths to tools/include(/uapi) were unneeded,
but it looks like a build error occurs depending on the compiler.

Commit 303a339f30a9 ("bpfilter: remove extra header search paths for
bpfilter_umh") reintroduced the build error fixed by commit ae40832e53c3
("bpfilter: fix a build err").

Apology for the breakage, and thanks to Guenter for reporting this.
