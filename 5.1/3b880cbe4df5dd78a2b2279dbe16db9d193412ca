ACPI / APEI: Move locking to the notification helper

ghes_copy_tofrom_phys() takes different locks depending on in_nmi().
This doesn't work if there are multiple NMI-like notifications, that
can interrupt each other.

Now that NOTIFY_SEA is always called in the same context, move the
lock-taking to the notification helper. The helper will always know
which lock to take. This avoids ghes_copy_tofrom_phys() taking a guess
based on in_nmi().

This splits NOTIFY_NMI and NOTIFY_SEA to use different locks. All
the other notifications use ghes_proc(), and are called in process
or IRQ context. Move the spin_lock_irqsave() around their ghes_proc()
calls.
