wil6210: ignore HALP ICR if already handled

HALP ICR is set as long as the FW should stay awake.
To prevent its multiple handling the driver masks this IRQ bit.
However, if there is a different MISC ICR before the driver clears
this bit, there is a risk of race condition between HALP mask and
unmask. This race leads to HALP timeout, in case it is mistakenly
masked.
Add an atomic flag to indicate if HALP ICR should be handled.
