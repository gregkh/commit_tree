iommu/iova: Fix tracking of recently failed iova address

If a 32 bit allocation request is too big to possibly succeed, it
early exits with a failure and then should never update max32_alloc_
size. This patch fixes current code, now the size is only updated if
the slow path failed while walking the tree. Without the fix the
allocation may enter the slow path again even if there was a failure
before of a request with the same or a smaller size.
