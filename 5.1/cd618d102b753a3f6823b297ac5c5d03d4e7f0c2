rcutorture: Record grace periods in forward-progress histogram

This commit records grace periods in rcutorture's n_launders_hist[]
histogram, thus allowing rcu_torture_fwd_cb_hist() to print out the
elapsed number of grace periods between buckets.  This information
helps to determine whether a lack of forward progress is due to stalled
grace periods on the one hand or due to sluggish callback invocation on
the other.
