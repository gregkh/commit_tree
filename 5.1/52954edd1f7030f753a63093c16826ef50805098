drm/i915: Allocate a status page for each timeline

Allocate a page for use as a status page by a group of timelines, as we
only need a dword of storage for each (rounded up to the cacheline for
safety) we can pack multiple timelines into the same page. Each timeline
will then be able to track its own HW seqno.

v2: Reuse the common per-engine HWSP for the solitary ringbuffer
timeline, so that we do not have to emit (using per-gen specialised
vfuncs) the breadcrumb into the distinct timeline HWSP and instead can
keep on using the common MI_STORE_DWORD_INDEX. However, to maintain the
sleight-of-hand for the global/per-context seqno switchover, we will
store both temporarily (and so use a custom offset for the shared timeline
HWSP until the switch over).

v3: Keep things simple and allocate a page for each timeline, page
sharing comes next.

v4: I was caught repeating the same MI_STORE_DWORD_IMM over and over
again in selftests.

v5: And caught red handed copying create timeline + check.
