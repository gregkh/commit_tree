xfs: move stat accounting to xfs_bmapi_convert_delalloc

This way we can actually count how many bytes got converted and how many
calls we need, unlike in the caller which doesn't have the detailed
view.

Note that this includes a slight change in behavior as the
xs_xstrat_quick is now bumped for every allocation instead of just the
one covering the requested writeback offset, which makes a lot more
sense.
