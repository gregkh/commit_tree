RDMA/umem: Revert broken 'off by one' fix

The previous attempted bug fix overlooked the fact that
ib_umem_odp_map_dma_single_page() was doing a put_page() upon hitting an
error. So there was not really a bug there.

Therefore, this reverts the off-by-one change, but keeps the change to use
release_pages() in the error path.
