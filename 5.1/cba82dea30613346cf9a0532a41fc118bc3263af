livepatch: Send a fake signal periodically

An administrator may send a fake signal to all remaining blocking tasks
of a running transition by writing to
/sys/kernel/livepatch/<patch>/signal attribute. Let's do it
automatically after 15 seconds. The timeout is chosen deliberately. It
gives the tasks enough time to transition themselves.

Theoretically, sending it once should be more than enough. However,
every task must get outside of a patched function to be successfully
transitioned. It could prove not to be simple and resending could be
helpful in that case.

A new workqueue job could be a cleaner solution to achieve it, but it
could also introduce deadlocks and cause more headaches with
synchronization and cancelling.
