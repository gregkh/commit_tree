spi: lpspi: Fix wrong transmission when don't use CONT

Add judgment on SR_MBF and FSR_RXCOUNT.

In PIO mode, if don't use CONT to keep cs selected in one transfer, the
transfer will go wrong. FCIE will be set after one frame transfer
finish. If use CONT, the frame refer to the whole data in one transfer.
If don't use CONT, the frame refer to one byte of whole data. This will
cause the transfer ending early.

This patch add a register reading in isr function, it might lead to a
slight decrease in the max transmission speed in PIO mode.
