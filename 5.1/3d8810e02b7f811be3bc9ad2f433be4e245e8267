powerpc/mm/hash: Increase vmalloc space to 512T with hash MMU

This patch updates the kernel non-linear virtual map to 512TB when
we're built with 64K page size and are using the hash MMU. We allocate
one context for the vmalloc region and hence the max virtual area size
is limited by the context map size (512TB for 64K and 64TB for 4K page
size).

This patch fixes boot failures with large amounts of system RAM where
we need large vmalloc space to handle per cpu allocations.
