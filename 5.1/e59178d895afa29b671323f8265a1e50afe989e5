RDMA/devices: Use xarray to store the clients

This gives each client a unique ID and will let us move client_data to use
xarray, and revise the locking scheme.

clients have to be add/removed in strict FIFO/LIFO order as they
interdepend. To support this the client_ids are assigned to increase in
FIFO order. The existing linked list is kept to support reverse iteration
until xarray can get a reverse iteration API.
