tools/bpf: add missing strings.h include

Few files in libbpf are using bzero() function (defined in strings.h header), but
don't include corresponding header. When libbpf is added as a dependency to pahole,
this undeterministically causes warnings on some machines:

bpf.c:225:2: warning: implicit declaration of function 'bzero' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  bzero(&attr, sizeof(attr));
