cpuset: Use fs_context

Make the cpuset filesystem use the filesystem context.  This is potentially
tricky as the cpuset fs is almost an alias for the cgroup filesystem, but
with some special parameters.

This can, however, be handled by setting up an appropriate cgroup
filesystem and returning the root directory of that as the root dir of this
one.
