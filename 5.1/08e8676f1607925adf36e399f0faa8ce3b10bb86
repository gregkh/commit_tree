IB/mlx5: Add support for 50Gbps per lane link modes

Driver now supports new link modes: 50Gbps per lane support for
50G/100G/200G. This patch reads the correct field (legacy vs. extended)
based on a FW indication bit, and adds a translation function (link
modes to IB width and speed) to the new link modes.
