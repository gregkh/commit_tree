scsi: ibmvscsi: Fix empty event pool access during host removal

The event pool used for queueing commands is destroyed fairly early in the
ibmvscsi_remove() code path. Since, this happens prior to the call so
scsi_remove_host() it is possible for further calls to queuecommand to be
processed which manifest as a panic due to a NULL pointer dereference as
seen here:

PANIC: "Unable to handle kernel paging request for data at address
0x00000000"

Context process backtrace:

The kernel buffer log is overfilled with this log:

[11261.952732] ibmvscsi: found no event struct in pool!

This patch reorders the operations during host teardown. Start by calling
the SRP transport and Scsi_Host remove functions to flush any outstanding
work and set the host offline. LLDD teardown follows including destruction
of the event pool, freeing the Command Response Queue (CRQ), and unmapping
any persistent buffers. The event pool destruction is protected by the
scsi_host lock, and the pool is purged prior of any requests for which we
never received a response. Finally, move the removal of the scsi host from
our global list to the end so that the host is easily locatable for
debugging purposes during teardown.
