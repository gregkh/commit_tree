lightnvm: pblk: extend line wp balance check

pblk stripes writes of minimal write size across all non-offline chunks
in a line, which means that the maximum write pointer delta should not
exceed the minimal write size.

Extend the line write pointer balance check to cover this case, and
ignore the offline chunk wps.

This will render us a warning during recovery if something unexpected
has happened to the chunk write pointers (i.e. powerloss,  a spurious
chunk reset, ..).
