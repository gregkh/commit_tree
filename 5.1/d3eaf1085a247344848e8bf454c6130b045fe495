mlxsw: spectrum: Add Spectrum-2 ASIC port type-speed operations

Add Spectrum-2 ASIC port type-speed operations.

Since multiple ethtool link modes are represented using a single bit in the
ASIC, the driver forces the user to configure all types per a specific
speed. For example, if the user wants to advertise 100Gbps 4-lanes speed,
he should advertise all the types of 100Gbps 4-lanes speed that are
supported by the ASIC as shown below:

  Supported ethtool bits for 100Gbps 4-lanes:
      0x1000000000      100000baseKR4 Full
      0x2000000000      100000baseSR4 Full
      0x4000000000      100000baseCR4 Full
      0x8000000000      100000baseLR4_ER4 Full

  Command for advertising 100Gbps 4-lanes:
      ethtool -s enp3s0np1 advertise 0xF000000000
