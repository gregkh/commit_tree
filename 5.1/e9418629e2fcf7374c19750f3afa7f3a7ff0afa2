ASoC: wm8741: Set OSR mode in hw_params()

For correct operation of the digital filtering and other processing on the
WM8741, the user must ensure the correct value of OSR[1:0] is set at all
times.[1] Hence, depending the selected sampling rate, set the OSR (over-
sampling rate) mode in hw_params().
