clk: samsung: exynos5: Fix kfree() of const memory on setting driver_override

Platform driver driver_override field should not be initialized from
const memory because the core later kfree() it.  If driver_override is
manually set later through sysfs, kfree() of old value leads to:

    $ echo "new_value" > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/.../driver_override

    kernel BUG at ../mm/slub.c:3960!

The clk-exynos5-subcmu driver uses override only for the purpose of
creating meaningful names for children devices (matching names of power
domains, e.g. DISP, MFC).  The driver_override was not developed for
this purpose so just switch to default names of devices to fix the
issue.
