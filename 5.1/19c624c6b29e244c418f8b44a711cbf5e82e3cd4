media: s5p-jpeg: Correct step and max values for V4L2_CID_JPEG_RESTART_INTERVAL

This commit corrects max and step values for v4l2 control for
V4L2_CID_JPEG_RESTART_INTERVAL. Max should be 0xffff and step should be 1.
It was found by using v4l2-compliance tool and checking result of
VIDIOC_QUERY_EXT_CTRL/QUERYMENU test.
Previously it was complaining that step was bigger than difference
between max and min.

Fixes: 15f4bc3b1f42 ("[media] s5p-jpeg: Add JPEG controls support")
