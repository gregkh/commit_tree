remoteproc: create vdev subdevice with specific dma memory pool

This patch creates a dedicated vdev subdevice for each vdev declared
in firmware resource table and associates carveout named "vdev%dbuffer"
(with %d vdev index in resource table) if any as dma coherent memory pool.

Then vdev subdevice is used as parent for virtio device.
