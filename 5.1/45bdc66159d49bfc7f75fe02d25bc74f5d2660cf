socket: Rename SO_RCVTIMEO/ SO_SNDTIMEO with _OLD suffixes

SO_RCVTIMEO and SO_SNDTIMEO socket options use struct timeval
as the time format. struct timeval is not y2038 safe.
The subsequent patches in the series add support for new socket
timeout options with _NEW suffix that will use y2038 safe
data structures. Although the existing struct timeval layout
is sufficiently wide to represent timeouts, because of the way
libc will interpret time_t based on user defined flag, these
new flags provide a way of having a structure that is the same
for all architectures consistently.
Rename the existing options with _OLD suffix forms so that the
right option is enabled for userspace applications according
to the architecture and time_t definition of libc.
