device-dax: Add a 'modalias' attribute to DAX 'bus' devices

Add a 'modalias' attribute to devices under the DAX bus so that userspace
is able to dynamically load modules as needed.

Normally, udev can get the modalias from 'uevent', and that is correctly
set up by the DAX bus. However other tooling such as 'libndctl' for
interacting with drivers/nvdimm/, and 'libdaxctl' for drivers/dax/ can
also use the modalias to dynamically load modules via libkmod lookups.

The 'nd' bus set up by the libnvdimm subsystem exports a modalias
attribute. Imitate this to export the same for the 'dax' bus.
