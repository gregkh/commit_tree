tracing: Fix event filters and triggers to handle negative numbers

Then tracing syscall exit event it is extremely useful to filter exit
codes equal to some negative value, to react only to required errors.
But negative numbers does not work:

[root@snorch sys_exit_read]# echo "ret == -1" > filter
bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
[root@snorch sys_exit_read]# cat filter
ret == -1
        ^
parse_error: Invalid value (did you forget quotes)?

Similar thing happens when setting triggers.

These is a regression in v4.17 introduced by the commit mentioned below,
testing without these commit shows no problem with negative numbers.
