gpiolib-acpi: Preserve non direction flags when updating gpiod_flags

__acpi_gpio_update_gpiod_flags purpose is to make the gpiod_flags used
when requesting a GPIO match the restrictions from the ACPI resource,
as stored in acpi_gpio_info.flags.

But acpi_gpio_info.flags only contains direction info, and the
requester may have passed in special non-direction flags like
GPIOD_FLAGS_BIT_NONEXCLUSIVE, which we currently clobber.

This commit modifies __acpi_gpio_update_gpiod_flags to preserve these
special flags, so that a requested of an ACPI GPIO can e.g. pass
GPIOD_FLAGS_BIT_NONEXCLUSIV and have it work as intended.
