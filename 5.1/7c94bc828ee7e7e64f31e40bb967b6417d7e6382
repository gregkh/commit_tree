drm/amdgpu: Setting doorbell range registers earlier

HW doorbell writing routing policy: writing to doorbell
not in SDMA/IH/MM/ACV doorbell range will be routed to CP.
So CP doorbell routing depends on doorbell range setting
of above blocks. Setting doorbell range of above blocks
earlier (soc15_common_hw_init) to make sure CP doorbell
writing be routed to CP block.
