qed: Revise load sequence to avoid PCI errors

Initiating final cleanup after an ungraceful driver unload can lead to bad
PCI accesses towards the host.
This patch revises the load sequence so final cleanup is sent while the
internal master enable is cleared, to prevent the host accesses, and clears
the internal error indications just before enabling the internal master
enable.
