powerpc/livepatch: relax reliable stack tracer checks for first-frame

The bottom-most stack frame (the first to be unwound) may be largely
uninitialized, for the "Power Architecture 64-Bit ELF V2 ABI" only
requires its backchain pointer to be set.

The reliable stack tracer should be careful when verifying this frame:
skip checks on STACK_FRAME_LR_SAVE and STACK_FRAME_MARKER offsets that
may contain uninitialized residual data.
