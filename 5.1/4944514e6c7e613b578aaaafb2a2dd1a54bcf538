cpufreq: e_powersaver: Use struct_size() in kzalloc()

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is
finding the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at
the end, along with memory for some number of elements for that
array. For example:

struct foo {
    int stuff;
    void *entry[];
};

instance = kzalloc(sizeof(struct foo) + sizeof(void *) * count, GFP_KERNEL);

Instead of leaving these open-coded and prone to type mistakes, we
can now use the new struct_size() helper:

instance = kzalloc(struct_size(instance, entry, count), GFP_KERNEL);

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
