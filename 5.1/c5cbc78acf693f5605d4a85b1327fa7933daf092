tty: serial: qcom_geni_serial: Initialize baud in qcom_geni_console_setup

When building with -Wsometimes-uninitialized, Clang warns:

drivers/tty/serial/qcom_geni_serial.c:1079:6: warning: variable 'baud'
is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is false
[-Wsometimes-uninitialized]

It's not wrong; when options is NULL, baud has no default value. Use
9600 as that is a sane default.
