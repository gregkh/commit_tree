btrfs: Remove unused arguments from btrfs_get_extent_fiemap

This function is a simple wrapper over btrfs_get_extent that returns
either:

a) A real extent in the passed range or
b) Adjusted extent based on whether delalloc bytes are found backing up
   a hole.

To support these semantics it doesn't need the page/pg_offset/create
arguments which are passed to btrfs_get_extent in case an extent is to
be created. So simplify the function by removing the unused arguments.
No functional changes.
