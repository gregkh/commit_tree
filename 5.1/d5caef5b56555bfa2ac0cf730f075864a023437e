btf: add BTF types deduplication algorithm

This patch implements BTF types deduplication algorithm. It allows to
greatly compress typical output of pahole's DWARF-to-BTF conversion or
LLVM's compilation output by detecting and collapsing identical types emitted in
isolation per compilation unit. Algorithm also resolves struct/union forward
declarations into concrete BTF types representing referenced struct/union. If
undesired, this resolution can be disabled through specifying corresponding options.

Algorithm itself and its application to Linux kernel's BTF types is
described in details at:
