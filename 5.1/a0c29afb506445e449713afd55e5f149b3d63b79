media: ov5640: Add register definition for test pattern register

The OV5640 can generate many types of test patterns, some with
additional modifiers, such as a rolling bar, or gamma gradients.

Add the bit definitions for all bits in the test pattern register,
and use them to compose the values to be written to the register.
