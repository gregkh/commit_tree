parport_pc: fix find_superio io compare code, should use equal test.

In the original code before 181bf1e815a2 the loop was continuing until
it finds the first matching superios[i].io and p->base.
But after 181bf1e815a2 the logic changed and the loop now returns the
pointer to the first mismatched array element which is then used in
get_superio_dma() and get_superio_irq() and thus returning the wrong
value.
Fix the condition so that it now returns the correct pointer.
