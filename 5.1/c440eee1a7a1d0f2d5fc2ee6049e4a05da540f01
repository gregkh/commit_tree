Staging: fbtft: Switch to the gpio descriptor interface

This switches the fbtft driver to use GPIO descriptors
rather than numerical gpios:

Utilize the GPIO library's intrinsic handling of OF GPIOs
and polarity. If the line is flagged active low, gpiolib
will deal with this.

Remove gpios from platform device structure. Neither assign
statically numbers to gpios in platform device nor allow
gpios to be parsed as module parameters.
