drm/i915: Apply missed interrupt after reset w/a to all ringbuffer gen

Having completed a test run of gem_eio across all machines in CI we also
observe the phenomenon (of lost interrupts after resetting the GPU) on
gen3 machines as well as the previously sighted gen6/gen7. Let's apply
the same HWSTAM workaround that was effective for gen6+ for all, as
although we haven't seen the same failure on gen4/5 it seems prudent to
keep the code the same.

As a consequence we can remove the extra setting of HWSTAM and apply the
register from a single site.

v2: Delazy and move the HWSTAM into its own function
v3: Mask off all HWSP writes on driver unload and engine cleanup.
v4: And what about the physical hwsp?
v5: No, engine->init_hw() is not called from driver_init_hw(), don't be
daft. Really scrub HWSTAM as early as we can in driver_init_mmio()
v6: Rename set_hwsp as it was setting the mask not the hwsp register.
v7: Ville pointed out that although vcs(bsd) was introduced for g4x/ilk,
per-engine HWSTAM was not introduced until gen6!
