iommu/vt-d: Support page request in scalable mode

VT-d Rev3.0 has made a few changes to the page request interface,

1. widened PRQ descriptor from 128 bits to 256 bits;
2. removed streaming response type;
3. introduced private data that requires page response even the
   request is not last request in group (LPIG).

This is a supplement to commit 1c4f88b7f1f92 ("iommu/vt-d: Shared
virtual address in scalable mode") and makes the svm code compliant
with VT-d Rev3.0.
