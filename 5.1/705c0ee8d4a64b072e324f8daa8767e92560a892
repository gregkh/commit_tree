bus: hisi_lpc: Don't fail probe for unrecognised child devices

Currently for ACPI-based FW we fail the probe for an unrecognised child
HID.

However, there is FW in the field with LPC child devices having fake HIDs,
namely "IPI0002", which was an IPMI device invented to support the
initial out-of-tree LPC host driver, different from the final mainline
version.

To provide compatibility support for these dodgy FWs, just discard the
unrecognised HIDs instead of failing the probe altogether.
