drm/amd/display: add stream ID and otg instance in dc_stream_state

[why]
stream ID allows DMs to avoid memory address comparisons to compare
stream equality.
otg_instance allows DC to more rigorously define when otg_instance
can change.  specifically, it is now defined to be only mutable when dc_stream_state
changes.  This is better than a "get status" function which prevents efficient
caching of otherwise very stable information.

[how]
stream ID follows similar pattern to sink ID, which is already implemented

otg_instance is an output which occurs on all dc_stream modification functions
