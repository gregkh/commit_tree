drm/i915: Markup paired operations on display power domains

The majority of runtime-pm operations are bounded and scoped within a
function; these are easy to verify that the wakeref are handled
correctly. We can employ the compiler to help us, and reduce the number
of wakerefs tracked when debugging, by passing around cookies provided
by the various rpm_get functions to their rpm_put counterpart. This
makes the pairing explicit, and given the required wakeref cookie the
compiler can verify that we pass an initialised value to the rpm_put
(quite handy for double checking error paths).
