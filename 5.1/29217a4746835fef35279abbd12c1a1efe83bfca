iommu/hyper-v: Add Hyper-V stub IOMMU driver

On the bare metal, enabling X2APIC mode requires interrupt remapping
function which helps to deliver irq to cpu with 32-bit APIC ID.
Hyper-V doesn't provide interrupt remapping function so far and Hyper-V
MSI protocol already supports to deliver interrupt to the CPU whose
virtual processor index is more than 255. IO-APIC interrupt still has
8-bit APIC ID limitation.

This patch is to add Hyper-V stub IOMMU driver in order to enable
X2APIC mode successfully in Hyper-V Linux guest. The driver returns X2APIC
interrupt remapping capability when X2APIC mode is available. Otherwise,
it creates a Hyper-V irq domain to limit IO-APIC interrupts' affinity
and make sure cpus assigned with IO-APIC interrupt have 8-bit APIC ID.

Define 24 IO-APIC remapping entries because Hyper-V only expose one
single IO-APIC and one IO-APIC has 24 pins according IO-APIC spec(
