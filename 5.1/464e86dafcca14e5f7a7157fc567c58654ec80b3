s390/qeth: remove a redundant check for card->dev

smatch complains that __qeth_l3_set_offline() first accesses card->dev,
and then later checks whether the pointer is valid.
Since commit d3d1b205e89f ("s390/qeth: allocate netdevice early"), the
pointer is _always_ valid - that patch merely missed to remove this one
check.
