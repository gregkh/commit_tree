scsi: hisi_sas: shutdown axi bus to avoid exception CQ returned

When injecting 2 bit ECC error, it will cause fatal AXI interrupts. Before
the recovery of SAS controller reset, the internal of SAS controller is in
error. If CQ interrupts return at the time, actually it is exception CQ
interrupt, and it may cause resource release in disorder.

To avoid the exception situation, shutdown AXI bus after fatal AXI
interrupt. In SAS controller reset, it will restart AXI bus. For later
version of v3 hw, hardware will shutdown AXI bus for this situation, so
just fix current ver of v3 hw.
