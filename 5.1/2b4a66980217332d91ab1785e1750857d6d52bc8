mac80211: make ieee80211_schedule_txq schedule empty TXQs

Currently there is no way for the driver to signal to mac80211 that it should
schedule a TXQ even if there are no packets on the mac80211 part of that queue.
This is problematic if the driver has an internal retry queue to deal with
software A-MPDU retry.

This patch changes the behavior of ieee80211_schedule_txq to always schedule
the queue, as its only user (ath9k) seems to expect such behavior already:
it calls this function on tx status and on powersave wakeup whenever its
internal retry queue is not empty.

Also add an extra argument to ieee80211_return_txq to get the same behavior.

This fixes an issue on ath9k where tx queues with packets to retry (and no
new packets in mac80211) would not get serviced.
