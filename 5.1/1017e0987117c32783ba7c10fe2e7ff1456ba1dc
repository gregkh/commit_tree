vrf: prevent adding upper devices

VRF devices don't work with upper devices. Currently, it's possible to
add a VRF device to a bridge or team, and to create macvlan, macsec, or
ipvlan devices on top of a VRF (bond and vlan are prevented respectively
by the lack of an ndo_set_mac_address op and the NETIF_F_VLAN_CHALLENGED
feature flag).

Fix this by setting the IFF_NO_RX_HANDLER flag (introduced in commit
f5426250a6ec ("net: introduce IFF_NO_RX_HANDLER")).
