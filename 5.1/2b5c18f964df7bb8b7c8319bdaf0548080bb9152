media: ov5640: Consolidate JPEG compression mode setting

The register value lists for all the supported resolution settings all
include a register address/value pair for setting the JPEG compression
mode. With the exception of 1080p (which sets mode 2), all resolutions
use mode 3.

The only difference between mode 2 and mode 3 is that mode 2 may have
padding data on the last line, while mode 3 does not add padding data.

As these register values were from dumps of running systems, and the
difference between the modes is quite small, using mode 3 for all
configurations should be OK.
