mm/hugetlb: enable arch specific huge page size support for migration

Architectures like arm64 have HugeTLB page sizes which are different
than generic sizes at PMD, PUD, PGD level and implemented via contiguous
bits.  At present these special size HugeTLB pages cannot be identified
through macros like (PMD|PUD|PGDIR)_SHIFT and hence chosen not be
migrated.

Enabling migration support for these special HugeTLB page sizes along
with the generic ones (PMD|PUD|PGD) would require identifying all of
them on a given platform.  A platform specific hook can precisely
enumerate all huge page sizes supported for migration.  Instead of
comparing against standard huge page orders let
hugetlb_migration_support() function call a platform hook
arch_hugetlb_migration_support().  Default definition for the platform
hook maintains existing semantics which checks standard huge page order.
But an architecture can choose to override the default and provide
support for a comprehensive set of huge page sizes.
