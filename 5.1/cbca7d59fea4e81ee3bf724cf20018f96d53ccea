Btrfs: add missing error handling after doing leaf/node binary search

The function map_private_extent_buffer() can return an -EINVAL error, and
it is called by generic_bin_search() which will return back the error. The
btrfs_bin_search() function in turn calls generic_bin_search() and the
key_search() function calls btrfs_bin_search(), so both can return the
-EINVAL error coming from the map_private_extent_buffer() function. Some
callers of these functions were ignoring that these functions can return
an error, so fix them to deal with error return values.
