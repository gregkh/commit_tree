net: sched: pie: add more cases to auto-tune alpha and beta

The current implementation scales the local alpha and beta
variables in the calculate_probability function by the same
amount for all values of drop probability below 1%.

RFC 8033 suggests using additional cases for auto-tuning
alpha and beta when the drop probability is less than 1%.

In order to add more auto-tuning cases, MAX_PROB must be
scaled by u64 instead of u32 to prevent underflow when
scaling the local alpha and beta variables in the
calculate_probability function.
