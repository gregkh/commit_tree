ASoC: hdmi-codec: fix S/PDIF DAI

When using the S/PDIF DAI, there is no requirement to call
snd_soc_dai_set_fmt() as there is no DAI format definition that defines
S/PDIF.  In any case, S/PDIF does not have separate clocks, this is
embedded into the data stream.

Consequently, when attempting to use TDA998x in S/PDIF mode, the attempt
to configure TDA998x via the hw_params callback fails as the
hdmi_codec_daifmt is left initialised to zero.

Since the S/PDIF DAI will only be used by S/PDIF, prepare the
hdmi_codec_daifmt structure for this format.
