PM / Domains: Mark "name" const in genpd_dev_pm_attach_by_name()

The genpd_dev_pm_attach_by_name() simply takes the name and passes it
to of_property_match_string() where the argument is "const char *".
Adding a const here allows a later patch to add a const to
dev_pm_domain_attach_by_name() which allows drivers to pass in a name
that was declared "const" in a driver.

Fixes: 5d6be70add65 ("PM / Domains: Introduce option to attach a device by name to genpd")
