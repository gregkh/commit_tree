ASoC: soc.h: add explanation of legacy/modern style of dai_link

Current ALSA SoC is assuming 1 CPU 1 Platform (= DMA) style system.
Because of this background, it is directly using
xxx_name / xxx_of_node / xxx_dai_name on dai_link.
Let's call it as legacy style here.

More complex style system like multi CPU multi Platform (= DMA) will
coming. To supporting it, we can use snd_soc_dai_link_component on
dai_link. Let's call it as modern style here.
But current ALSA SoC can't support it so far. Thus, we need to have
multi CPU / multi Codec / multi Platform style in the future on ALSA SoC.

Currently we already have multi Codec support. Platform is starting to
use modern style on dai_link, but still style only. Multi Platform is
not yet implemented. And we still don't have multi CPU support on ALSA
SoC, and not have modern style either.

Currently, if driver is using legacy style Codec/Platform, it will be
converted to modern style on soc-core. This means, we are using glue code
for legacy vs modern style so far on ALSA SoC.
We can fully switch to modern style on all drivers if ALSA SoC supported
modern style for CPU, and then, legacy style code will be removed from
ALSA SoC.
Untile then, we need to keep both legacy/modern style and its glue code.
This patch adds such future plan and background on soc.h
