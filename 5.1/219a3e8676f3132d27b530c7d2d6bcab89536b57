integrity, KEYS: add a reference to platform keyring

commit 9dc92c45177a ("integrity: Define a trusted platform keyring")
introduced a .platform keyring for storing preboot keys, used for
verifying kernel image signatures. Currently only IMA-appraisal is able
to use the keyring to verify kernel images that have their signature
stored in xattr.

This patch exposes the .platform keyring, making it accessible for
verifying PE signed kernel images as well.
