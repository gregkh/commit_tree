proc: test /proc/*/maps, smaps, smaps_rollup, statm

Start testing VM related fiels found in per-process files.

Do it by jiting small executable which brings its address space to
precisely known state, then comparing /proc/*/maps, smaps, smaps_rollup,
and statm files to expected values.

Currently only x86_64 is supported.
