scsi: lpfc: Fix setting affinity hints to correlate with hardware queues

The desired affinity for the hardware queue behavior is for hdwq 0 to be
affinitized with cpu 0, hdwq 1 to cpu 1, and so on.  The implementation so
far does not do this if the number of cpus is greater than the number of
hardware queues (e.g. hardware queue allocation was administratively
reduced or hardware queue resources could not scale to the cpu count).

Correct the queue affinitization logic when queue count is less than
cpu count.
