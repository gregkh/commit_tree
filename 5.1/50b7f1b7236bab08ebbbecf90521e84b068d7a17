vfio: ccw: only free cp on final interrupt

When we get an interrupt for a channel program, it is not
necessarily the final interrupt; for example, the issuing
guest may request an intermediate interrupt by specifying
the program-controlled-interrupt flag on a ccw.

We must not switch the state to idle if the interrupt is not
yet final; even more importantly, we must not free the translated
channel program if the interrupt is not yet final, or the host
can crash during cp rewind.
