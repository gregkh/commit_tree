ext4: cleanup pagecache before swap i_data

While do swap, we should make sure there has no new dirty page since we
should swap i_data between two inode:
1.We should lock i_mmap_sem with write to avoid new pagecache from mmap
read/write;
2.Change filemap_flush to filemap_write_and_wait and move them to the
space protected by inode lock to avoid new pagecache from buffer read/write.
