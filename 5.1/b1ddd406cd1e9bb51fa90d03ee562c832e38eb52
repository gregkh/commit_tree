xen: remove pre-xen3 fallback handlers

The legacy hypercall handlers were originally added with
a comment explaining that "copying the argument structures in
HYPERVISOR_event_channel_op() and HYPERVISOR_physdev_op() into the local
variable is sufficiently safe" and only made sure to not write
past the end of the argument structure, the checks in linux/string.h
disagree with that, when link-time optimizations are used:

In function 'memcpy',
    inlined from 'pirq_query_unmask' at drivers/xen/fallback.c:53:2,
    inlined from '__startup_pirq' at drivers/xen/events/events_base.c:529:2,
    inlined from 'restore_pirqs' at drivers/xen/events/events_base.c:1439:3,
    inlined from 'xen_irq_resume' at drivers/xen/events/events_base.c:1581:2:
include/linux/string.h:350:3: error: call to '__read_overflow2' declared with attribute error: detected read beyond size of object passed as 2nd parameter
   __read_overflow2();
   ^

Further research turned out that only Xen 3.0.2 or earlier required the
fallback at all, while all versions in use today don't need it.
As far as I can tell, it is not even possible to run a mainline kernel
on those old Xen releases, at the time when they were in use, only
a patched kernel was supported anyway.
