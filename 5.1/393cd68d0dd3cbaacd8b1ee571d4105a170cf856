platform/x86: intel_cht_int33fe: Remove old style mux connections

The new mux connection naming scheme is now in use, so
dropping the connections still using the old names. From now
on the same connection description named "mode-switch" is
used with both the port and the alternate modes, so on CHT
the DP alt mode will use the same connection as the port to
get a handle to the mux device.
