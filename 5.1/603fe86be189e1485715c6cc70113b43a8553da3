dmaengine: bcm2835: Enforce control block alignment

Per section 4.2.1.1 of the BCM2835 ARM Peripherals spec, control blocks
"must start at a 256 bit aligned address":
https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf

This rule is currently satisfied only by accident because struct
bcm2835_dma_cb has a size of 256 bit and the DMA pool API happens to
allocate blocks consecutively.  It seems safer to be explicit and tell
the DMA pool allocator about the required alignment.
