drm/amd/display: Ungate stream before programming registers

[Why]
Certain tests fail after a fresh reboot. This is caused by writing to
registers prior to ungating the stream we're trying to program.

[How]
Make sure the stream is ungated before writing to its registers.
This also enables power-gating plane resources before init_hw
initializes them.
Additionally, this does some refactoring to move gating/ungating
from enable/disable_plane functions to where stream resources are
enabled/disabled.
