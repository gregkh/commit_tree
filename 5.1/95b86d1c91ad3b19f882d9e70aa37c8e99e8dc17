RDMA/bnxt_re: Update kernel user abi to pass chip context

User space verbs provider library would need chip context.  Changing the
ABI to add chip version details in structure.  Furthermore, changing the
kernel driver ucontext allocation code to initialize the abi structure
with appropriate values.

As suggested by community, appended the new fields at the bottom of the
ABI structure and retaining to older fields as those were in the older
versions.

Keeping the ABI version at 1 and adding a new field in the ucontext
response structure to hold the component mask.  The user space library
should check pre-defined flags to figure out if a certain feature is
supported on not.
