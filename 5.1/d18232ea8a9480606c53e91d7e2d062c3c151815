ARM: KVM: Teach some form of type-safety to kvm_call_hyp

Just like on arm64, and for the same reasons, kvm_call_hyp removes
any form of type safety when calling into HYP. But we can still
try to tell the compiler what we're trying to achieve.

Here, we can add code that would do the function call if it wasn't
guarded by an always-false predicate. Hopefully, the compiler is
dumb enough to do the type checking and clever enough to not emit
the corresponding code...
