ARM: dts: am437x: replace linux,wakeup with wakeup-source property

Most of the legacy "linux,wakeup" boolean property is already replaced
with "wakeup-source". However few occurrences of old property has popped
up again, probably from the remnants in downstream trees.

Replace the legacy properties with the unified "wakeup-source" property
introduced in the commit aeda5003d0b9 ("Input: matrix_keypad - change
name of wakeup property to "wakeup-source"")
