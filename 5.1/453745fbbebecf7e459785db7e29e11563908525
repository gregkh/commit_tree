bcache: fix input overflow to journal_delay_ms

c->journal_delay_ms is in type unsigned short, it is set via sysfs
interface and converted by sysfs_strtoul() from input string to
unsigned short value. Therefore overflow to unsigned short might be
happen when the converted value exceed USHRT_MAX. e.g. writing
65536 into sysfs file journal_delay_ms, c->journal_delay_ms is set to
0.

This patch uses sysfs_strtoul_clamp() to convert the input string and
limit value range in [0, USHRT_MAX], to avoid the input overflow.
