drm/amd/display: Reformat dm_determine_update_type_for_commit

[Why]
The indenting for this function is a few levels too deep and can be
simplified a fair bit. This patch is in preparation for functional
changes that fix update type determination to occur less frequently
and more accurately.

[How]
Place checks early and exit/continue when possible. This isn't
a functional change.
