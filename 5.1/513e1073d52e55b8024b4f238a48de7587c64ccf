locking/lockdep: Add debug_locks check in __lock_downgrade()

Tetsuo Handa had reported he saw an incorrect "downgrading a read lock"
warning right after a previous lockdep warning. It is likely that the
previous warning turned off lock debugging causing the lockdep to have
inconsistency states leading to the lock downgrade warning.

Fix that by add a check for debug_locks at the beginning of
__lock_downgrade().
