arm64: Unmask PMR before going idle

CPU does not received signals for interrupts with a priority masked by
ICC_PMR_EL1. This means the CPU might not come back from a WFI
instruction.

Make sure ICC_PMR_EL1 does not mask interrupts when doing a WFI.

Since the logic of cpu_do_idle is becoming a bit more complex than just
two instructions, lets turn it from ASM to C.
