ASoC: cs4341: fix waring unused-function

The driver cs4341 can be built with SPI and/or I2C, but it has to be one
of them at least. When I2C is set as a module we see the warning below:

sound/soc/codecs/cs4341.c:213:12: warning: ‘cs4341_probe’
defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
 static int cs4341_probe(struct device *dev)
            ^~~~~~~~~~~~

Rework so that we use IS_ENABLED instead of defined. Also change so
SND_SOC_CS4341 depends on SND_SOC_I2C_AND_SPI to we dont' get a link
error when SND_SOC_CS4341=y, I2C=m and REGMAP_I2C=m is set.
