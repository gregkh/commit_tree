ASoC: dapm: Only power up active channels from a DAI

Currently all widgets attached to a DAI link will be powered
up when the DAI is active, however this may include routes
that are not actually in use if there are unused channels
available on the DAI.

The macros for creating AIF widgets already include an entry for
slot, it is proposed to change that to channel. The effective
difference here being respresenting the logical channel index
rather than the physical slot index. The CODECs currently
using the slot entry on the DAPM_AIF macros are using it in
a manner consistent with this, the CODECs not using it just
have the field set to zero.

A variable is added to snd_soc_dapm_widget to represent
this channel index and then for each AIF widget attached to
a DAI this is compared against the number of channels on
the stream. Enabling the links for those which will be in
use. This has the nice property that the CODECs which haven't
used the slot/channel entry in the macro will function exactly
as before due to all the AIF widgets having a channel of zero
and a stream by definition having at least one channel.
