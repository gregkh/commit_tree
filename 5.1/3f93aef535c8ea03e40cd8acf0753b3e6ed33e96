btrfs: add zstd compression level support

Zstd compression requires different amounts of memory for each level of
compression. The prior patches implemented indirection to allow for each
compression type to manage their workspaces independently. This patch
uses this indirection to implement compression level support for zstd.

To manage the additional memory require, each compression level has its
own queue of workspaces. A global LRU is used to help with reclaim.
Reclaim is done via a timer which provides a mechanism to decrease
memory utilization by keeping only workspaces around that are sized
appropriately. Forward progress is guaranteed by a preallocated max
workspace hidden from the LRU.

When getting a workspace, it uses a bitmap to identify the levels that
are populated and scans up. If it finds a workspace that is greater than
it, it uses it, but does not update the last_used time and the
corresponding place in the LRU. If we hit memory pressure, we sleep on
the max level workspace. We continue to rescan in case we can use a
smaller workspace, but eventually should be able to obtain the max level
workspace or allocate one again should memory pressure subside.

The memory requirement for decompression is the same as level 1, and
therefore can use any of available workspace.

The number of workspaces is bound by an upper limit of the workqueue's
limit which currently is 2 (percpu limit). The reclaim timer is used to
free inactive/improperly sized workspaces and is set to 307s to avoid
colliding with transaction commit (every 30s).

Repeating the experiment from v2 [1], the Silesia corpus was copied to a
btrfs filesystem 10 times and then read back after dropping the caches.
The btrfs filesystem was on an SSD.
