clk: clk-gpio: add support for sleeping GPIOs in gpio-gate-clk

The current implementation of gpio-gate-clk enables/disables the clock
using the GPIO in the ->enable() and ->disable() clock callbacks. This
requires the GPIO to be configurable in atomic contexts. While it is
the case for most memory-mapped GPIO controllers, it is not the case
for GPIO expanders on I2C or SPI.

This commit extends the gpio-gate-clk to check whether the GPIO calls
require sleeping or not. If sleeping is not required, the current
implementation based on ->enable()/->disable() is kept. However, if
sleeping is needed, we instead implement the logic in the ->prepare()
and ->unprepare() hooks. Thanks to this, a gate clock connected to a
GPIO on a GPIO expander can be controlled with the existing driver.
