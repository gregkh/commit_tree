powerpc/eeh_cache: Bump log level of eeh_addr_cache_print()

To use this function at all #define DEBUG needs to be set in eeh_cache.c.
Considering that printing at pr_debug is probably not all that useful since
it adds the additional hurdle of requiring you to enable the debug print if
dynamic_debug is in use so this patch bumps it to pr_info.
