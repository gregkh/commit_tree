drm/doc: Make igts for cross-driver stuff strongly suggested

Compared to the RFC[1] no changes to the patch itself, but igt moved
forward a lot:

- gitlab CI builds with: reduced configs/libraries, arm cross build
  and a sysroot build (should address all the build/cross platform
  concerns raised in the RFC discussions).

- tests reorganized into subdirectories so that the i915-gem tests
  don't clog the main/shared tests directory anymore

- quite a few more non-intel people contributing/reviewing/committing
  igt tests patches.

I think this addresses all the concerns raised in the RFC discussions,
and assuming there's enough Acks and no new issues that pop up, we can
go ahead with this.

v2:
- Use "should" (in the usual RFC sense) to make it clear that in the
  end this is all up to reviewer's discretion, as usual (Jani).
- Also in the title s/mandatory/strongly suggested/ (me)
- Make it clear we're not going to block features if a testcase is not
  feasible, given hw and state of igt, both having some good gaps in
  what can be tested (Harry, Eric, Sean, ...).
