clk: qcom: Make common clk_hw registrations

Several clock controller drivers define a list of clk_hw devices, and then
register those devices in probe() before using common code to process the
rest of initialization.  Extend the common code to accept a list of clk_hw
devices to process, thus eliminating many duplicate implementations.
