phy: sun4i-usb: Support set_mode to USB_HOST for non-OTG PHYs

While only the first PHY supports mode switching, the remaining PHYs
work in USB host mode. They should support set_mode with mode=USB_HOST
instead of failing. This is especially needed now that the USB core does
set_mode for all USB ports, which was added in commit b97a31348379 ("usb:
core: comply to PHY framework").

Make set_mode with mode=USB_HOST a no-op instead of failing for the
non-OTG USB PHYs.
