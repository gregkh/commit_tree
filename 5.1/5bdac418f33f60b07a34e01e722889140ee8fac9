netfilter: nat: fix icmp id randomization

Sven Auhagen reported that a 2nd ping request will fail if 'fully-random'
mode is used.

Reason is that if no proto information is given, min/max are both 0,
so we set the icmp id to 0 instead of chosing a random value between
0 and 65535.

Update test case as well to catch this, without fix this yields:
[..]
ERROR: cannot ping ns1 from ns2 with ip masquerade fully-random (attempt 2)
ERROR: cannot ping ns1 from ns2 with ipv6 masquerade fully-random (attempt 2)

... becaus 2nd ping clashes with existing 'id 0' icmp conntrack and gets
dropped.
