sctp: get sctphdr by offset in sctp_compute_cksum

sctp_hdr(skb) only works when skb->transport_header is set properly.

But in Netfilter, skb->transport_header for ipv6 is not guaranteed
to be right value for sctphdr. It would cause to fail to check the
checksum for sctp packets.

So fix it by using offset, which is always right in all places.

v1->v2:
  - Fix the changelog.
