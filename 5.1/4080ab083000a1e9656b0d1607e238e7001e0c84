PM-runtime: Take suppliers into account in __pm_runtime_set_status()

If the target device has any suppliers, as reflected by device links
to them, __pm_runtime_set_status() does not take them into account,
which is not consistent with the other parts of the PM-runtime
framework and may lead to programming mistakes.

Modify __pm_runtime_set_status() to take suppliers into account by
activating them upfront if the new status is RPM_ACTIVE and
deactivating them on exit if the new status is RPM_SUSPENDED.

If the activation of one of the suppliers fails, the new status
will be RPM_SUSPENDED and the (remaining) suppliers will be
deactivated on exit (the child count of the device's parent
will be dropped too then).

Of course, adding device links locking to __pm_runtime_set_status()
means that it cannot be run fron interrupt context, so make it use
spin_lock_irq() and spin_unlock_irq() instead of spin_lock_irqsave()
and spin_unlock_irqrestore(), respectively.
