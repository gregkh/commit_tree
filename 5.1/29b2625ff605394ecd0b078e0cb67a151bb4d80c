ALSA: info: Move card id proc creation into info.c

The creation of card's id proc file can be moved gracefully into
info.c.  Also, the assignment of card->proc_id is superfluous and can
be dropped.  So let's do it.

Basically this is no functional change but code refactoring, but one
potential behavior change is that now it returns properly the error
code from snd_info_card_register(), which is a good thing (tm).
