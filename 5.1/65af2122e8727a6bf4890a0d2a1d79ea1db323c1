ALSA: hda/tegra: get clock handles early in probe

Moved devm_clk_get() API calls to a separate function and the same
can be called early in the probe. This is done before runtime PM
for the device is enabled. The runtime resume/suspend callbacks can
later enable/disable clocks respectively(the support would be added
in subsequent patches). Clock handles should be available by the
time runtime suspend/resume calls can happen.
