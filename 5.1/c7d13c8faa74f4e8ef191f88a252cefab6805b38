tcp: properly track retry time on passive Fast Open

This patch addresses a corner issue on timeout behavior of a
passive Fast Open socket.  A passive Fast Open server may write
and close the socket when it is re-trying SYN-ACK to complete
the handshake. After the handshake is completely, the server does
not properly stamp the recovery start time (tp->retrans_stamp is
0), and the socket may abort immediately on the very first FIN
timeout, instead of retying until it passes the system or user
specified limit.
