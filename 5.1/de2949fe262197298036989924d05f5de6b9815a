ASoC: audio-graph-card: add 1 CPU : 1 Codec support again

audio-graph-card is now supporting normal sound and DPCM sound.
For DPCM sound, original sound card (= audio-graph-scu) had been
supported 1 CPU : 1 Codec connection which uses hw_params_fixup()
for convert-rate/channel.
But, merged audio-graph-card is completely forgeting about it.

This patch re-support it.
