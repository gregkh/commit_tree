spi: sh-msiof: Use DMA if possible

Currently, this driver only supports feature for DMA 32-bits.
In this case, only if the data length is divisible by 4 to use
DMA, otherwise PIO will be used. This patch will suggest use
the DMA 32-bits with 4bytes of words, then the remaining data
will be transmitted by PIO mode.
