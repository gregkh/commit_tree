mm, page_alloc: always use a captured page regardless of compaction result

During the development of commit 5e1f0f098b46 ("mm, compaction: capture
a page under direct compaction"), a paranoid check was added to ensure
that if a captured page was available after compaction that it was
consistent with the final state of compaction.  The intent was to catch
serious programming bugs such as using a stale page pointer and causing
corruption problems.

However, it is possible to get a captured page even if compaction was
unsuccessful if an interrupt triggered and happened to free pages in
interrupt context that got merged into a suitable high-order page.  It's
highly unlikely but Li Wang did report the following warning on s390
occuring when testing OOM handling.  Note that the warning is slightly
edited for clarity.

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 9783 at mm/page_alloc.c:3777 __alloc_pages_direct_compact+0x182/0x190

This patch simply removes the check entirely instead of trying to be
clever about pages freed from interrupt context.  If a serious
programming error was introduced, it is highly likely to be caught by
prep_new_page() instead.
