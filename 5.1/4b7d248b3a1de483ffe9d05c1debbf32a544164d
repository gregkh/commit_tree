audit: move loginuid and sessionid from CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL to CONFIG_AUDIT

loginuid and sessionid (and audit_log_session_info) should be part of
CONFIG_AUDIT scope and not CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL since it is used in
CONFIG_CHANGE, ANOM_LINK, FEATURE_CHANGE (and INTEGRITY_RULE), none of
which are otherwise dependent on AUDITSYSCALL.
