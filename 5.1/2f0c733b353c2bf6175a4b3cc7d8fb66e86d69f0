drm/i915/ringbuffer: Remove irq-seqno w/a for gen6/7 rcs

Having transitioned to using PIPECONTROL to combine the flush with the
breadcrumb write using their post-sync functions, assume that this will
resolve the serialisation with the subsequent MI_USER_INTERRUPT. That is
when inspecting the breadcrumb after an interrupt we can rely on the write
being posted (i.e. the HWSP will be coherent).

Testing using gem_sync shows that the PIPECONTROL + CS stall does
serialise the command streamer sufficient that the breadcrumb lands
before the MI_USER_INTERRUPT. The same is not true for MI_FLUSH_DW.
