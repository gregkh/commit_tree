net: hns3: call hns3_nic_set_real_num_queue with netdev down

hns3_client_setup_tc in enet is for updating TC configuration to
stack, and hclge_setup_tc in hclge_dcb is mainly for setting the
configuration to hardware.

This patch removes the hns3_nic_set_real_num_queue from
hns3_setup_tc in enet, and call hclge_client_setup_tc to update
TC configuration to stack with netdev down, because the netdev
down operation is done in hclge_dcb now.
