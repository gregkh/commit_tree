tools lib traceevent: Fix buffer overflow in arg_eval

Fix buffer overflow observed when running perf test.

The overflow is when trying to evaluate "1ULL << (64 - 1)" which is
resulting in -9223372036854775808 which overflows the 20 character
buffer.

If is possible this bug has been reported before but I still don't see
any fix checked in:
