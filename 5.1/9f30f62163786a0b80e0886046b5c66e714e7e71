KVM: s390: add gib_alert_irq_handler()

The patch implements a handler for GIB alert interruptions
on the host. Its task is to alert guests that interrupts are
pending for them.

A GIB alert interrupt statistic counter is added as well:

$ cat /proc/interrupts
          CPU0       CPU1
  ...
  GAL:      23         37   [I/O] GIB Alert
  ...
