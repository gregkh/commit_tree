s390: use generic UID16 implementation

s390 has an almost identical copy of the code in kernel/uid16.c.

The problem here is that it requires calling the regular system calls,
which the generic implementation handles correctly, but the internal
interfaces are not declared in a global header for this.

The best way forward here seems to be to just use the generic code and
delete the s390 specific implementation.

I keep the changes to uapi/asm/posix_types.h inside of an #ifdef check
so user space does not observe any changes. As some of the system calls
pass pointers, we also need wrappers in compat_wrapper.c, which I add
for all calls with at least one argument. All those wrappers can be
removed in a later step.
