mtd: rawnand: marvell: Clean the controller state before each operation

Since the migration of the driver to stop using the legacy
->select_chip() hook, there is nothing deselecting the target anymore,
thus the selection is not forced at the next access. Ensure the ND_RUN
bit and the interrupts are always in a clean state.
