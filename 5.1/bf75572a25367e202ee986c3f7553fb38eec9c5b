drm/amd/display: Create switching mechanism for ABM 2.2

[Why]
Need method of detecting which version of the DMCU FW is loaded and
load the appropriate iRAM.

[How]
Create definition for ABM 2.2 iRAM, and load it if the DMCU FW version
number matches the ABM 2.2 version; otherwise load ABM 2.1 iRAM.
