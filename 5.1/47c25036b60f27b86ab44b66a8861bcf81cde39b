MIPS: Fix kernel crash for R6 in jump label branch function

Insert Branch instruction instead of NOP to make sure assembler don't
patch code in forbidden slot. In jump label function, it might
be possible to patch Control Transfer Instructions(CTIs) into
forbidden slot, which will generate Reserved Instruction exception
in MIPS release 6.
