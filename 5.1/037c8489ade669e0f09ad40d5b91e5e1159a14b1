libnvdimm/security: provide fix for secure-erase to use zero-key

Add a zero key in order to standardize hardware that want a key of 0's to
be passed. Some platforms defaults to a zero-key with security enabled
rather than allow the OS to enable the security. The zero key would allow
us to manage those platform as well. This also adds a fix to secure erase
so it can use the zero key to do crypto erase. Some other security commands
already use zero keys. This introduces a standard zero-key to allow
unification of semantics cross nvdimm security commands.
