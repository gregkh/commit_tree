scsi: MAINTAINERS: Add reviewers for UFS patches

According to git log and the linux-scsi archives, Vinayak has been inactive
for several years. Removing him as maintainer will make the
get_maintainer.pl script generate an extensive list of recipients.  Add
three reviewers as well to vet future UFS patches.
