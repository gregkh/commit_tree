scsi: lpfc: Remove extra vector and SLI4 queue for Expresslane

There is a extra queue and msix vector for expresslane. Now that the driver
will be doing queues per cpu, this oddball queue is no longer needed.
Expresslane will utilize the normal per-cpu queues.

Updated debugfs sli4 queue output to go along with the change
