driver core: Add device link flag DL_FLAG_AUTOPROBE_CONSUMER

Add a new device link flag, DL_FLAG_AUTOPROBE_CONSUMER, to request the
driver core to probe for a consumer driver automatically after binding
a driver to the supplier device on a persistent managed device link.

As unbinding the supplier driver on a managed device link causes the
consumer driver to be detached from its device automatically, this
flag provides a complementary mechanism which is needed to address
some "composite device" use cases.
