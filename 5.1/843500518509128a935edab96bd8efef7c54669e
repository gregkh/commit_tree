mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Do rollback as another call to mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_vchunk_migrate_all()

In order to simplify the code and to prepare it for
interrupted/continued migration process, do the rollback in case of
migration error as another call to mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_vchunk_migrate_all().
It can be understood as "migrate all back".
