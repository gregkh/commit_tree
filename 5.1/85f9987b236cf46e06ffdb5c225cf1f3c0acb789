fix incorrect error code mapping for OBJECTID_NOT_FOUND

It was mapped to EIO which can be confusing when user space
queries for an object GUID for an object for which the server
file system doesn't support (or hasn't saved one).

As Amir Goldstein suggested this is similar to ENOATTR
(equivalently ENODATA in Linux errno definitions) so
changing NT STATUS code mapping for OBJECTID_NOT_FOUND
to ENODATA.
