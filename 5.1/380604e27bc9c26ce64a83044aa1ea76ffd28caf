drm/amd/display: Use 100 Hz precision for pipe pixel clocks

[Why]
Users would like more accurate pixel clocks, especially for fractional
"TV" frame rates like 59.94 Hz.

[How]
Store and communicate pixel clocks with 100 Hz accuracy from
dc_crtc_timing through to BIOS command table setpixelclock call.
