SUNRPC: Prevent thundering herd when the socket is not connected

If the socket is not connected, then we want to initiate a reconnect
rather that trying to transmit requests. If there is a large number
of requests queued and waiting for the lock in call_transmit(),
then it can take a while for one of the to loop back and retake
the lock in call_connect.
