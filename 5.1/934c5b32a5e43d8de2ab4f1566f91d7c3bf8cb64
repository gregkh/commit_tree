drm/nouveau: Stop using drm_crtc_force_disable

The correct way for legacy drivers to update properties that need to
do a full modeset, is to do a full modeset.

Note that we don't need to call the drm_mode_config_internal helper
because we're not changing any of the refcounted paramters.

v2: Fixup error handling (Ville). Since the old code didn't bother
I decided to just delete it instead of adding even more code for just
error handling.
