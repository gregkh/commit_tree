audit: add syscall information to CONFIG_CHANGE records

Tie syscall information to all CONFIG_CHANGE calls since they are all a
result of user actions.

Exclude user records from syscall context:
Since the function audit_log_common_recv_msg() is shared by a number of
AUDIT_CONFIG_CHANGE and the entire range of AUDIT_USER_* record types,
and since the AUDIT_CONFIG_CHANGE message type has been converted to a
syscall accompanied record type, special-case the AUDIT_USER_* range of
messages so they remain standalone records.
