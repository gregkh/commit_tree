Btrfs: remove no longer needed range length checks for deduplication

Comparing the content of the pages in the range to deduplicate is now
done in generic_remap_checks called by the generic helper
generic_remap_file_range_prep(), which takes care of ensuring we do not
compare/deduplicate undefined data beyond a file's EOF (range from EOF
to the next block boundary). So remove these checks which are now
redundant.
