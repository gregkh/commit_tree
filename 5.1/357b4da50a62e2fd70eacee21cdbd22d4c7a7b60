x86: respect memory size limiting via mem= parameter

When limiting memory size via kernel parameter "mem=" this should be
respected even in case of memory made accessible via a PCI card.

Today this kind of memory won't be made usable in initial memory
setup as the memory won't be visible in E820 map, but it might be
added when adding PCI devices due to corresponding ACPI table entries.

Not respecting "mem=" can be corrected by adding a global max_mem_size
variable set by parse_memopt() which will result in rejecting adding
memory areas resulting in a memory size above the allowed limit.
