btrfs: be more explicit about allowed flush states

For FLUSH_LIMIT flushers we really can only allocate chunks and flush
delayed inode items, everything else is problematic.  I added a bunch of
new states and it lead to weirdness in the FLUSH_LIMIT case because I
forgot about how it worked.  So instead explicitly declare the states
that are ok for flushing with FLUSH_LIMIT and use that for our state
machine.  Then as we add new things that are safe we can just add them
to this list.
