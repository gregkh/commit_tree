rcu: Rename rcu_process_callbacks() to rcu_core() for Tree RCU

Although the name rcu_process_callbacks() still makes sense for Tiny
RCU, where most of what it does is invoke callbacks, it no longer makes
much sense for Tree RCU, especially given that the actually callback
invocation is relegated to rcu_do_batch(), or, for no-CBs CPUs, to the
rcuo kthreads.  Especially in the latter case, rcu_process_callbacks()
has very little to do with actual callbacks.  A better description of
this function is that it performs RCU's core processing.

This commit therefore changes the name of Tree RCU's rcu_process_callbacks()
function to rcu_core(), which also has the virtue of being consistent with
the existing invoke_rcu_core() function.

While in the area, the header comment is reworked.
