dpaa2-eth: configure the cache stashing amount on a queue

Configure the amount of 64 bytes of frame, annotation and context data
that will be cache stashed for a specific frame queue.  Since the frame
context is not used, configure that only 64 bytes of frame data and 64
bytes of annotation will be stashed.
