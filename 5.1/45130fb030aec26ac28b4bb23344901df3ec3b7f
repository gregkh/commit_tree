staging: iio: adt7316: fix the dac read calculation

The calculation of the current dac value is using the wrong bits of the
dac lsb register. Create two macros to shift the lsb register value into
lsb position, depending on whether the dac is 10 or 12 bit. Initialize
data to 0 so, with an 8 bit dac, the msb register value can be bitwise
ORed with data.
