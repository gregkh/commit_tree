lib/raid6: use vdupq_n_u8 to avoid endianness warnings

Clang warns: vector initializers are not compatible with NEON intrinsics
in big endian mode [-Wnonportable-vector-initialization]

While this is usually the case, it's not an issue for this case since
we're initializing the uint8x16_t (16x uint8_t's) with the same value.

Instead, use vdupq_n_u8 which both compilers lower into a single movi

This avoids the static storage for a constant value.
