bpf: verifier support JMP32

This patch teach verifier about the new BPF_JMP32 instruction class.
Verifier need to treat it similar as the existing BPF_JMP class.
A BPF_JMP32 insn needs to go through all checks that have been done on
BPF_JMP.

Also, verifier is doing runtime optimizations based on the extra info
conditional jump instruction could offer, especially when the comparison is
between constant and register that the value range of the register could be
improved based on the comparison results. These code are updated
accordingly.
