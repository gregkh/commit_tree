cpufreq: scmi: Register an Energy Model

The Energy Model (EM) framework provides an API to register the active
power of CPUs. Call this API from the scmi-cpufreq driver by using the
power costs obtained from firmware. This is done to ensure interested
subsystems (the task scheduler, for example) can make use of the EM
when available.
