net: stmmac: Fix NAPI poll in TX path when in multi-queue

Commit 8fce33317023 introduced the concept of NAPI per-channel and
independent cleaning of TX path.

This is currently breaking performance in some cases. The scenario
happens when all packets are being received in Queue 0 but the TX is
performed in Queue != 0.

Fix this by using different NAPI instances per each TX and RX queue, as
suggested by Florian.

Changes from v2:
	- Only force restart transmission if there are pending packets
Changes from v1:
	- Pass entire ring size to TX clean path (Florian)
