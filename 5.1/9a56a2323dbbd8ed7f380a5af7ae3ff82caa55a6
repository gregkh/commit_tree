io_uring: use fget/fput_many() for file references

Add a separate io_submit_state structure, to cache some of the things
we need for IO submission.

One such example is file reference batching. io_submit_state. We get as
many references as the number of sqes we are submitting, and drop
unused ones if we end up switching files. The assumption here is that
we're usually only dealing with one fd, and if there are multiple,
hopefuly they are at least somewhat ordered. Could trivially be extended
to cover multiple fds, if needed.

On the completion side we do the same thing, except this is trivially
done just locally in io_iopoll_reap().
