usb: typec: tps6598x: handle block writes separately with plain-I2C adapters

Commit 1a2f474d328f handles block _reads_ separately with plain-I2C
adapters, but the problem described with regmap-i2c not handling
SMBus block transfers (i.e. read and writes) correctly also exists
with writes.

As workaround, this patch adds a block write function the same way
1a2f474d328f adds a block read function.

Fixes: 1a2f474d328f ("usb: typec: tps6598x: handle block reads separately with plain-I2C adapters")
Fixes: 0a4c005bd171 ("usb: typec: driver for TI TPS6598x USB Power Delivery controllers")
