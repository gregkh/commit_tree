mlxsw: core: Do not use WQ_MEM_RECLAIM for EMAD workqueue

The EMAD workqueue is used to handle retransmission of EMAD packets that
contain configuration data for the device's firmware.

Given the workers need to allocate these packets and that the code is
not called as part of memory reclaim path, remove the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM
flag.
