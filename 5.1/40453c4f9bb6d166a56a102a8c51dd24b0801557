kcov: improve CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_KCOV help text

The help text for CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_KCOV is stale, and describes the
feature as being enabled only for x86_64, when it is now enabled for
several architectures, including arm, arm64, powerpc, and s390.

Let's remove that stale help text, and update it along the lines of hat
for ARCH_HAS_FORTIFY_SOURCE, better describing when an architecture
should select CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_KCOV.
