device-dax: Add /sys/class/dax backwards compatibility

On the expectation that some environments may not upgrade libdaxctl
(userspace component that depends on the /sys/class/dax hierarchy),
provide a default / legacy dax_pmem_compat driver. The dax_pmem_compat
driver implements the original /sys/class/dax sysfs layout rather than
/sys/bus/dax. When userspace is upgraded it can blacklist this module
and switch to the dax_pmem driver going forward.

CONFIG_DEV_DAX_PMEM_COMPAT and supporting code will be deleted according
to the dax_pmem entry in Documentation/ABI/obsolete/.
