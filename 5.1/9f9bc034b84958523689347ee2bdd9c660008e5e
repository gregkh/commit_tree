xfs: update fork seq counter on data fork changes

The sequence counter in the xfs_ifork structure is only updated on
COW forks. This is because the counter is currently only used to
optimize out repetitive COW fork checks at writeback time.

Tweak the extent code to update the seq counter regardless of the
fork type in preparation for using this counter on data forks as
well.
