drm/amdgpu: Simplify eviction fence handling

Temporarily removing eviction fences to avoid triggering them by
accident is no longer necessary due to the fence_owner logic in
amdgpu_sync_resv.

As a result the ef_list usage of amdgpu_amdkfd_remove_eviction_fence
and amdgpu_amdkfd_add_eviction_fence are no longer needed.
