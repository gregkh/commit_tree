net: sched: introduce and use qstats read helpers

Classful qdiscs can't access directly the child qdiscs backlog
length: if such qdisc is NOLOCK, per CPU values should be
accounted instead.

Most qdiscs no not respect the above. As a result, qstats fetching
for most classful qdisc is currently incorrect: if the child qdisc is
NOLOCK, it always reports 0 len backlog.

This change introduces a pair of helpers to safely fetch
both backlog and qlen and use them in stats class dumping
functions, fixing the above issue and cleaning a bit the code.

DRR needs also to access the child qdisc queue length, so it
needs custom handling.
