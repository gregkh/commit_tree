soc/tegra: pmc: Support systems where PMC is marked secure

On Tegra210 systems with new enough boot software, direct register
accesses to PMC register space from the non-secure world are not
allowed. Instead a monitor call may be used to read and write PMC
registers.

Add code to detect such a system by attempting to write a scratch
register and detecting if the write happened or not. If not, we switch
to doing all register accesses through the monitor call.
