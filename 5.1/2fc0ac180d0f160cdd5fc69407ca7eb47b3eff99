iommu/tegra: gart: Optimize mapping / unmapping performance

Currently GART writes one page entry at a time. More optimal would be to
aggregate the writes and flush BUS buffer in the end, this gives map/unmap
10-40% performance boost (depending on size of mapping) in comparison to
flushing after each page entry update.
