drm/i915/tv: Filter out >1024 wide modes that would need vertical scaling on gen3

Since gen3 can't handle >1024 wide sources with vertical scaling
let's not advertize such modes in the mode list. Less tempetation
to the user to try out things that won't work.

v2: s/IS_GEN3(dev_priv/IS_GEN(dev_priv, 3)/
