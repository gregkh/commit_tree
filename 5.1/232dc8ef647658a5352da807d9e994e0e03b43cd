net/smc: original socket family in inet_sock_diag

Commit ed75986f4aae ("net/smc: ipv6 support for smc_diag.c") changed the
value of the diag_family field. The idea was to indicate the family of
the IP address in the inet_diag_sockid field. But the change makes it
impossible to distinguish an inet_sock_diag response message from SMC
sock_diag response. This patch restores the original behaviour and sends
AF_SMC as value of the diag_family field.
