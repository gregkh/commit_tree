drm/fb-helper: generic: Fix setup error path

If register_framebuffer() fails during fbdev setup we will leak the
framebuffer, the GEM buffer and the shadow buffer for defio. This is
because drm_fb_helper_fbdev_setup() just calls drm_fb_helper_fini() on
error not taking into account that register_framebuffer() can fail.

Since the generic emulation uses DRM client for its framebuffer and
backing buffer in addition to a shadow buffer, it's necessary to open code
drm_fb_helper_fbdev_setup() to properly handle the error path.

Error cleanup is removed from .fb_probe and is handled by one function for
all paths.
