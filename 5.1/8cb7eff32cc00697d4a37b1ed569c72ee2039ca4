arm64: daifflags: Include PMR in daifflags restore operations

The addition of PMR should not bypass the semantics of daifflags.

When DA_F are set, I bit is also set as no interrupts (even of higher
priority) is allowed.

When DA_F are cleared, I bit is cleared and interrupt enabling/disabling
goes through ICC_PMR_EL1.
