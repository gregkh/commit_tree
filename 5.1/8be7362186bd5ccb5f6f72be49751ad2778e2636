net: hns3: fix bug of ethtool_ops.get_channels for VF

The current code returns the number of all queues that can be used and
the number of queues that have been allocated, which is incorrect.
What should be returned is the number of queues allocated for each enabled
TC and the number of queues that can be allocated.

This patch fixes it.
