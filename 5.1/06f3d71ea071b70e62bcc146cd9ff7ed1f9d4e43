nvme-fc: fix numa_node when dev is null

A recent change added a numa_node field to the nvme controller
and has the transport assign the node using dev_to_node().
However, fcloop registers with a NULL device struct, so the
dev_to_node() call oops.

Revise the assignment to assign no node when device struct is null.
