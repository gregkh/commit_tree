powerpc/kconfig: define CONFIG_DATA_SHIFT and CONFIG_ETEXT_SHIFT

CONFIG_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX requires a special alignment
for DATA for some subarches. Today it is just defined
as an #ifdef in vmlinux.lds.S

In order to get more flexibility, this patch moves the
definition of this alignment in Kconfig

On some subarches, CONFIG_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX will
require a special alignment of _etext.

This patch also adds a configuration item for it in Kconfig
