btrfs: add compression interface in (get/put)_workspace

There are two levels of workspace management. First, alloc()/free()
which are responsible for actually creating and destroy workspaces.
Second, at a higher level, get()/put() which is the compression code
asking for a workspace from a workspace_manager.

The compression code shouldn't really care how it gets a workspace, but
that it got a workspace. This adds get_workspace() and put_workspace()
to be the higher level interface which is responsible for indexing into
the appropriate compression type. It also introduces
btrfs_put_workspace() and btrfs_get_workspace() to be the generic
implementations of the higher interface.
