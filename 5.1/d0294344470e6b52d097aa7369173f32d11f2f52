IB/hfi1: Fix the allocation of RSM table

The receive side mapping (RSM) on hfi1 hardware is a special
matching mechanism to direct an incoming packet to a given
hardware receive context. It has 4 instances of matching capabilities
(RSM0 - RSM3) that share the same RSM table (RMT). The RMT has a total of
256 entries, each of which points to a receive context.

Currently, three instances of RSM have been used:
1. RSM0 by QOS;
2. RSM1 by PSM FECN;
3. RSM2 by VNIC.

Each RSM instance should reserve enough entries in RMT to function
properly. Since both PSM and VNIC could allocate any receive context
between dd->first_dyn_alloc_ctxt and dd->num_rcv_contexts, PSM FECN must
reserve enough RMT entries to cover the entire receive context index
range (dd->num_rcv_contexts - dd->first_dyn_alloc_ctxt) instead of only
the user receive contexts allocated for PSM
(dd->num_user_contexts). Consequently, the sizing of
dd->num_user_contexts in set_up_context_variables is incorrect.
