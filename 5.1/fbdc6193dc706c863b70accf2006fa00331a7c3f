RISC-V: Assign hwcap as per comman capabilities.

Currently, we set hwcap based on first valid hart from DT. This may not
be correct always as that hart might not be current booting cpu or may
have a different capability.

Set hwcap as the capabilities supported by all possible harts with "okay"
status.
