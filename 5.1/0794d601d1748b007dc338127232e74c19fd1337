scsi: lpfc: Implement common IO buffers between NVME and SCSI

Currently, both NVME and SCSI get their IO buffers from separate
pools. XRI's are associated 1:1 with IO buffers, so XRI's are also split
between protocols.

Eliminate the independent pools and use a single pool. Each buffer
structure now has a common section and a protocol section. Per protocol
routines for SGL initialization are removed and replaced by common
routines. Initialization of the buffers is only done on the common area.
All other fields, which are protocol specific, are initialized when the
buffer is allocated for use in the per-protocol allocation routine.

In the past, the SCSI side allocated IO buffers as part of slave_alloc
calls until the maximum XRIs for SCSI was reached. As all XRIs are now
common and may be used for either protocol, allocation for everything is
done as part of adapter initialization and the scsi side has no action in
slave alloc.

As XRI's are no longer split, the lpfc_xri_split module parameter is
removed.

Adapters based on SLI3 will continue to use the older scsi_buf_list_get/put
routines.  All SLI4 adapters utilize the new IO buffer scheme
