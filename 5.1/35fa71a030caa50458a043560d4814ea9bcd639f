io_uring: fail io_uring_register(2) on a dying io_uring instance

If we have multiple threads doing io_uring_register(2) on an io_uring
fd, then we can potentially try and kill the percpu reference while
someone else has already killed it.

Prevent this race by failing io_uring_register(2) if the ref is marked
dying. This is safe since we're inside the io_uring mutex.
