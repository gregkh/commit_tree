scsi: lpfc: Fix missing wakeups on abort threads

Abort thread wakeups, on some wqe types, are not happening.  The thread
wakeup logic is dependent upon the LPFC_DRIVER_ABORTED flag. However, on
these wqes, the completion handler running prior to the io completion
routine ends up clearing the flag.

Rework the wakeup logic to look at a non-null waitq element which must be
set if the abort thread is waiting. This is reverting the change in the
indicated patch.
