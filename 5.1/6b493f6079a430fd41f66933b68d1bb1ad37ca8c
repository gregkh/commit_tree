powerpc/eeh: Allow disabling recovery

Currently when we detect an error we automatically invoke the EEH recovery
handler. This can be annoying when debugging EEH problems, or when working
on EEH itself so this patch adds a debugfs knob that will prevent a
recovery event from being queued up when an issue is detected.
