Btrfs: do not overwrite error return value in the get device stats ioctl

If the call to btrfs_get_dev_stats() failed we would overwrite the error
returned to user space with -EFAULT if the call to copy_to_user() failed
as well. Fix that by calling copy_to_user() only if btrfs_get_dev_stats()
returned success.
