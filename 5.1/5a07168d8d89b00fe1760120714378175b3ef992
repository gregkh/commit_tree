futex: Ensure that futex address is aligned in handle_futex_death()

The futex code requires that the user space addresses of futexes are 32bit
aligned. sys_futex() checks this in futex_get_keys() but the robust list
code has no alignment check in place.

As a consequence the kernel crashes on architectures with strict alignment
requirements in handle_futex_death() when trying to cmpxchg() on an
unaligned futex address which was retrieved from the robust list.

[ tglx: Rewrote changelog, proper sizeof() based alignement check and add
  	comment ]
