staging: android: ashmem: Avoid range_alloc() allocation with ashmem_mutex held.

ashmem_pin() is calling range_shrink() without checking whether
range_alloc() succeeded. Also, doing memory allocation with ashmem_mutex
held should be avoided because ashmem_shrink_scan() tries to hold it.

Therefore, move memory allocation for range_alloc() to ashmem_pin_unpin()
and make range_alloc() not to fail.

This patch is mostly meant for backporting purpose for fuzz testing on
stable/distributor kernels, for there is a plan to remove this code in
near future.
