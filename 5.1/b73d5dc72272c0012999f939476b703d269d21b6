livepatch: samples: non static warnings fix

Sparse reported warnings about non-static symbols. For the variables
a simple static attribute is fine - for the functions referenced by
livepatch via klp_func the symbol-names must be unmodified in the
symbol table and the patchable code has to be emitted. The resolution
is to attach __used attribute to the shared statically declared functions.
