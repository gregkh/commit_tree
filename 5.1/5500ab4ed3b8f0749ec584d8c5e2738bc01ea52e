ocfs2: fix the application IO timeout when fstrim is running

The user reported this problem, the upper application IO was timeout
when fstrim was running on this ocfs2 partition.  the application
monitoring resource agent considered that this application did not work,
then this node was fenced by the cluster brain (e.g.  pacemaker).

The root cause is that fstrim thread always holds main_bm meta-file
related locks until all the cluster groups are trimmed.  This patch will
make fstrim thread release main_bm meta-file related locks when each
cluster group is trimmed, this will let the current application IO has a
chance to claim the clusters from main_bm meta-file.
