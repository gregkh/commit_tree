ASoC: sun4i-codec: Add sun7i_codec_controls, sun7i_codec_codec

Introduce sun7i_codec_controls because some of the controls are different
on Allwinner A20 compared to Allwinner A10.

Also introduce sun7i_codec_codec in order to use sun7i_codec_controls and
make sun7i_codec_quirks use sun7i_codec_codec.
