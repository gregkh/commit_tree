rtc: ds1307: rx8130: Fix alarm handling

When the EXTENSION.WADA bit is set, register 0x19 contains a bitmap of
week days, not a day of month. As Linux only handles a single alarm
without repetition using day of month is more flexible, so clear this
bit. (Otherwise a value depending on time.tm_wday would have to be
written to register 0x19.)

Also optimize setting the AIE bit to use a single register write instead
of a bulk write of three registers.
