IB/hfi: Move RC functions into a header file

This patch moves some RC helper functions into a header file so that
they can be called from both RC and  TID RDMA functions. In addition,
a common function for rewinding a request is created in rdmavt so that
it can be shared between qib and hfi1 driver.
