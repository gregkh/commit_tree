kbuild: source include/config/auto.conf instead of ${KCONFIG_CONFIG}

As commit 423a8155facf ("kbuild: Fix reading of .config in
link-vmlinux.sh") addressed, some shells fail to perform '.' if
${KCONFIG_CONFIG} does not contain a slash at all.

Instead, we can source include/config/auto.conf, which obviously
contain slashes, and we do not expect its file path overridden by
a user. Perhaps, the performance might be slightly better since
unset CONFIG options are stripped from include/config/auto.conf.

scripts/setlocalversion already works this way.
