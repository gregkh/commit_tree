devlink: require non-NULL ops for devlink instances

Commit 76726ccb7f46 ("devlink: add flash update command") and
commit 2d8dc5bbf4e7 ("devlink: Add support for reload")
access devlink ops without NULL-checking. There is, however, no
driver which would pass in NULL ops, so let's just make that
a requirement. Remove the now unnecessary NULL-checking.
