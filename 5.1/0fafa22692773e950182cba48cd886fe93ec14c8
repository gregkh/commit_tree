drm/i915/lvds: only call intel_lvds_init() on platforms that might have LVDS

With new platforms not having LVDS support, only call intel_lvds_init()
on platforms that might actually have LVDS. Move the comment about eDP
init to the PCH block where it's relevant.

This puts intel_lvds_init() more in line with the rest of the outputs,
and makes it slightly easier for the uninitiated to figure out which
platforms actually have what.
