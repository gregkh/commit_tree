arm64: KVM: Always set ICH_HCR_EL2.EN if GICv4 is enabled

The normal interrupt flow is not to enable the vgic when no virtual
interrupt is to be injected (i.e. the LRs are empty). But when a guest
is likely to use GICv4 for LPIs, we absolutely need to switch it on
at all times. Otherwise, VLPIs only get delivered when there is something
in the LRs, which doesn't happen very often.
