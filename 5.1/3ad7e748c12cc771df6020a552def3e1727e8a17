x86/MCE/AMD, EDAC/mce_amd: Add new McaTypes for CS, PSP, and SMU units

The existing CS, PSP, and SMU SMCA bank types will see new versions (as
indicated by their McaTypes) in future SMCA systems.

Add the new (HWID, MCATYPE) tuples for these new versions. Reuse the
same names as the older versions, since they are logically the same to
the user. SMCA systems won't mix and match IP blocks with different
McaType versions in the same system, so there isn't a need to
distinguish them. The MCA_IPID register is saved when logging an MCA
error, and that can be used to triage the error.

Also, add the new error descriptions to edac_mce_amd. Some error types
(positions in the list) are overloaded compared to the previous
McaTypes. Therefore, just create new lists of the error descriptions to
keep things simple even if some of the error descriptions are the same
between versions.
