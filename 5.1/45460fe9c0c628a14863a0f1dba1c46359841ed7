regulator: da9052: Use lowercase regulator names to match the DT

Since c32569e358ad ("regulator: Use of_node_name_eq for node name
comparisons"), regulator node name comparisons are case sensitive.
The DA9052 driver uses uppercase, but the DT has lowercase.

Fix this by using a lowercase regulator name to match the DT node name.
