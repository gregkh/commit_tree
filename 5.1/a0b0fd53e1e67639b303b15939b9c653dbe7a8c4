locking/lockdep: Free lock classes that are no longer in use

Instead of leaving lock classes that are no longer in use in the
lock_classes array, reuse entries from that array that are no longer in
use. Maintain a linked list of free lock classes with list head
'free_lock_class'. Only add freed lock classes to the free_lock_classes
list after a grace period to avoid that a lock_classes[] element would
be reused while an RCU reader is accessing it. Since the lockdep
selftests run in a context where sleeping is not allowed and since the
selftests require that lock resetting/zapping works with debug_locks
off, make the behavior of lockdep_free_key_range() and
lockdep_reset_lock() depend on whether or not these are called from
the context of the lockdep selftests.

Thanks to Peter for having shown how to modify get_pending_free()
such that that function does not have to sleep.
