cfg80211: Notify all User Hints To self managed wiphys

Currently Self Managed WIPHY's are not notified on any
hints other than user cell base station hints.
Self Managed wiphy's basically rely on hints from firmware
and its local regdb for regulatory management, so hints from wireless
core can be ignored. But all user hints needs to be notified
to them to provide flexibility to these drivers to honour or
ignore these user hints.

Currently none of the drivers supporting self managed wiphy
register a notifier with cfg80211. Hence this change does not affect
any other driver behavior.
