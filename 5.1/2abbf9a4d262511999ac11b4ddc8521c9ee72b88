gfs: no need to check return value of debugfs_create functions

When calling debugfs functions, there is no need to ever check the
return value.  The function can work or not, but the code logic should
never do something different based on this.

There is no need to save the dentries for the debugfs files, so drop
those variables to save a bit of space and make the code simpler.
