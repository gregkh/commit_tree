device-dax: Introduce bus + driver model

In support of multiple device-dax instances per device-dax-region and
allowing the 'kmem' driver to attach to dax-instances instead of the
current device-node access, convert the dax sub-system from a class to a
bus. Recall that the kmem driver takes reserved / special purpose
memories and assigns them to be managed by the core-mm.

Aside from the fact the device-dax instances are registered and probed
on a bus, two other lifetime-management changes are made:

1/ Delay attaching a cdev until driver probe time

2/ A new run_dax() helper is introduced to allow restoring dax-operation
   after a kill_dax() event. So, at driver ->probe() time we run_dax()
   and at ->remove() time we kill_dax() and invalidate all mappings.
