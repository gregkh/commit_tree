lib/scatterlist: Provide a DMA page iterator

Commit 2db76d7c3c6d ("lib/scatterlist: sg_page_iter: support sg lists w/o
backing pages") introduced the sg_page_iter_dma_address() function without
providing a way to use it in the general case. If the sg_dma_len() is not
equal to the sg length callers cannot safely use the
for_each_sg_page/sg_page_iter_dma_address combination.

Resolve this API mistake by providing a DMA specific iterator,
for_each_sg_dma_page(), that uses the right length so
sg_page_iter_dma_address() works as expected with all sglists.

A new iterator type is introduced to provide compile-time safety against
wrongly mixing accessors and iterators.
