btrfs: Fix grossly misleading argument names in extent io search

The variables and function parameters of __etree_search which pertain to
prev/next are grossly misnamed. Namely, prev_ret holds the next state
and not the previous. Similarly, next_ret actually holds the previous
extent state relating to the offset we are interested in. Fix this by
renaming the variables as well as switching the arguments order. No
functional changes.
