block: fix handling for BIO_NO_PAGE_REF

Commit 399254aaf489211 ("block: add BIO_NO_PAGE_REF flag") introduces
BIO_NO_PAGE_REF, and once this flag is set for one bio, all pages
in the bio won't be get/put during IO.

However, if one bio is submitted via __blkdev_direct_IO_simple(),
even though BIO_NO_PAGE_REF is set, pages still may be put.

Fixes this issue by avoiding to put pages if BIO_NO_PAGE_REF is
set.
