spi: Go back to immediate teardown

Commit 412e6037324 ("spi: core: avoid waking pump thread from spi_sync
instead run teardown delayed") introduced regressions on some boards,
apparently connected to spi_mem not triggering shutdown properly any
more.  Since we've thus far been unable to figure out exactly where the
breakage is revert the optimisation for now.
