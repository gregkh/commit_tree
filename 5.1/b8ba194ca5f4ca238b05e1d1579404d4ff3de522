pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7791: Fix VIN1 versioned groups

The naming of the "b" versions of the VIN1 pin groups is a bit odd, in
that the "_b" appears in the middle of the names, instead of as a
suffix.

Increase consistency with other SoCs by making R-Car M2-W and M2-N, and
RZ/G1M and RZ/G1N, use the recently added optional "version" argument of
the VIN_DATA_PIN_GROUP() macro.

Note that this breaks backwards compatibility with existing DTBs, but
there are no upstream users of the "vin1_b_*" names.
