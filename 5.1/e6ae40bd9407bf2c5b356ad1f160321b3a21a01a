drm/sun4i: Move the BT.601 CSC coefficients to the frontend

Both the backend and the frontend need the BT.601 CSC coefficients for
YUV to RGB conversion. Since the backend has a dependency on the
frontend (and not the other way round), move the coefficients there
so that both can access them without having to duplicate them.
