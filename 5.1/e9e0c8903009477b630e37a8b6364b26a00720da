fanotify: encode file identifier for FAN_REPORT_FID

When user requests the flag FAN_REPORT_FID in fanotify_init(),
a unique file identifier of the event target object will be reported
with the event.

The file identifier includes the filesystem's fsid (i.e. from statfs(2))
and an NFS file handle of the file (i.e. from name_to_handle_at(2)).

The file identifier makes holding the path reference and passing a file
descriptor to user redundant, so those are disabled in a group with
FAN_REPORT_FID.

Encode fid and store it in event for a group with FAN_REPORT_FID.
Up to 12 bytes of file handle on 32bit arch (16 bytes on 64bit arch)
are stored inline in fanotify_event struct. Larger file handles are
stored in an external allocated buffer.

On failure to encode fid, we print a warning and queue the event
without the fid information.

[JK: Fold part of later patched into this one to use
exportfs_encode_inode_fh() right away]
