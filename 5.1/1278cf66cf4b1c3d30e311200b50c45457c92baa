nvram: Replace nvram_* function exports with static functions

Replace nvram_* functions with static functions in nvram.h. These will
become wrappers for struct nvram_ops method calls.

This patch effectively disables existing NVRAM functionality so as to
allow the rest of the series to be bisected without build failures.
That functionality is gradually re-implemented in subsequent patches.

Replace the sole validate-checksum-and-read-byte sequence with a call to
nvram_read() which will gain the same semantics in subsequent patches.

Remove unused exports.
