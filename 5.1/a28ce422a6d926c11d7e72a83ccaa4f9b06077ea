habanalabs: disable CPU access on timeouts

This patch provides a workaround for a bug in the F/W where the response
time for a request from KMD may take more then 100ms. This could cause the
queue between KMD and the F/W to get out of sync.

The WA is to:
1. Increase the timeout of ALL requests to 1s.
2. In case a request isn't answered in time, mark the state as
"cpu_disabled" and prevent sending further requests from KMD to the F/W.
This will eventually lead to a heartbeat failure and hard reset of the
device.
