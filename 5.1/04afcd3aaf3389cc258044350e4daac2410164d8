vt: ignore sequences that contain ':' in parameters.

csi sequences can contain subparameters delimited by ':' characters. For
now just ignore the whole sequence in this case. Such sequences are used by
more capable terminal implementations with T.416 high color modes or
extended underline rendition attributes.

Also ignore sequences with private use characters '?', '>', '='
and '>' that are not at the initial position.
