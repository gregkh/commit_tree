scsi: virtio_scsi: limit number of hw queues by nr_cpu_ids

When tag_set->nr_maps is 1, the block layer limits the number of hw queues
by nr_cpu_ids. No matter how many hw queues are used by virtio-scsi, as it
has (tag_set->nr_maps == 1), it can use at most nr_cpu_ids hw queues.

In addition, specifically for pci scenario, when the 'num_queues' specified
by qemu is more than maxcpus, virtio-scsi would not be able to allocate
more than maxcpus vectors in order to have a vector for each queue. As a
result, it falls back into MSI-X with one vector for config and one shared
for queues.

Considering above reasons, this patch limits the number of hw queues used
by virtio-scsi by nr_cpu_ids.
