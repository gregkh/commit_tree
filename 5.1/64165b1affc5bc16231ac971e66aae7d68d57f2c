mm: swapoff: take notice of completion sooner

The old try_to_unuse() implementation was driven by find_next_to_unuse(),
which terminated as soon as all the swap had been freed.

Add inuse_pages checks now (alongside signal_pending()) to stop scanning
mms and swap_map once finished.

The same ought to be done in shmem_unuse() too, but never was before,
and needs a different interface: so leave it as is for now.
