netfilter: conntrack: gre: convert rwlock to rcu

We can use gre.  Lock is only needed when a new expectation is added.

In case a single spinlock proves to be problematic we can either add one
per netns or use an array of locks combined with net_hash_mix() or similar
to pick the 'correct' one.

But given this is only needed for an expectation rather than per packet
a single one should be ok.
