Bluetooth: Mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases
where we are expecting to fall through.

This patch fixes the following warnings:

net/bluetooth/rfcomm/core.c:479:6: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:4223:6: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]

Warning level 3 was used: -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3

This patch is part of the ongoing efforts to enabling
-Wimplicit-fallthrough.
