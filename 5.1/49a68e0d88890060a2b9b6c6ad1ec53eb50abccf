cfg80211: add various struct element finding helpers

We currently have a number of helpers to find elements that just
return a u8 *, change those to return a struct element and add
inlines to deal with the u8 * compatibility.

Note that the match behaviour is changed to start the natch at
the data, so conversion from _ie_match to _elem_match need to
be done carefully.
