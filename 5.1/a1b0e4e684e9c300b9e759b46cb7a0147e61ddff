bnxt_en: Improve RX consumer index validity check.

There is logic to check that the RX/TPA consumer index is the expected
index to work around a hardware problem.  However, the potentially bad
consumer index is first used to index into an array to reference an entry.
This can potentially crash if the bad consumer index is beyond legal
range.  Improve the logic to use the consumer index for dereferencing
after the validity check and log an error message.
