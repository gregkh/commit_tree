mm: replace all open encodings for NUMA_NO_NODE

Patch series "Replace all open encodings for NUMA_NO_NODE", v3.

All these places for replacement were found by running the following
grep patterns on the entire kernel code.  Please let me know if this
might have missed some instances.  This might also have replaced some
false positives.  I will appreciate suggestions, inputs and review.

1. git grep "nid == -1"
2. git grep "node == -1"
3. git grep "nid = -1"
4. git grep "node = -1"

This patch (of 2):

At present there are multiple places where invalid node number is
encoded as -1.  Even though implicitly understood it is always better to
have macros in there.  Replace these open encodings for an invalid node
number with the global macro NUMA_NO_NODE.  This helps remove NUMA
related assumptions like 'invalid node' from various places redirecting
them to a common definition.
