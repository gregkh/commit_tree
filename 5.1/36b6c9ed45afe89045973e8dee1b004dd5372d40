drm/vkms: fix use-after-free when drm_gem_handle_create() fails

If drm_gem_handle_create() fails in vkms_gem_create(), then the
vkms_gem_object is freed twice: once when the reference is dropped by
drm_gem_object_put_unlocked(), and again by the extra calls to
drm_gem_object_release() and kfree().

Fix it by skipping the second release and free.

This bug was originally found in the vgem driver by syzkaller using
fault injection, but I noticed it's also present in the vkms driver.
