tpm: add _head suffix to tcg_efi_specid_event and tcg_pcr_event2

TCG defines two structures, TCG_EfiSpecIDEventStruct and TCG_PCR_EVENT2,
which contain variable-sized arrays in the middle of the definition.

Since these structures are not suitable for type casting, this patch
removes structure members after the variable-sized arrays and adds the
_head suffix to the structure name, to indicate that the renamed structures
do not contain all fields defined by TCG.

Lastly, given that variable-sized arrays are now in the last position, and
given that the size of the arrays cannot be determined in advance, this
patch also sets the size of those arrays to zero and removes the definition
of TPM2_ACTIVE_PCR_BANKS.
