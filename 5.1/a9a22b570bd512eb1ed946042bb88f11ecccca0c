cpufreq: Replace double NOT (!!) with single NOT (!)

Double NOT (!!) operation is normally done to convert a non-zero value
to 1 and keep zero as is, but that isn't the requirement in this case.
All we wanted was to make sure that only one of the two routines isn't
set, i.e. either both function pointers are set or both are unset.

This can be done with a single NOT (!) operation as well.
