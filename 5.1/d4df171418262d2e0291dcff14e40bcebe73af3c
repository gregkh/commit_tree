drm/msm/gpu: fix building without debugfs

When debugfs is disabled, but coredump is turned on, the adreno driver fails to build:

drivers/gpu/drm/msm/adreno/a3xx_gpu.c:460:4: error: 'struct msm_gpu_funcs' has no member named 'show'
   .show = adreno_show,
    ^~~~

Adjust the #ifdef to make it build again.
