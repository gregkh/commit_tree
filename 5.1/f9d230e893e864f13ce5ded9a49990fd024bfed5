x86/boot: Correct RSDP parsing with 32-bit EFI

Guenter Roeck reported triple faults of a 64-bit VM using a 32-bit OVMF
EFI image. After some singlestepping of the image in gdb, it turned out
that some of the EFI config tables were at bogus addresses. Which, as
Ard pointed out, results from using the wrong efi_config_table typedef.

So switch all EFI table pointers to unsigned longs and convert them to
the proper typedef only when accessing them. This way, the proper table
type is being used.

Shorten variable names, while at it.
