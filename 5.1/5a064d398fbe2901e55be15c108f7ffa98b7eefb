x86/asm/suspend: Drop ENTRY from local data

ENTRY is intended for functions and shall be paired with ENDPROC. ENTRY
also aligns symbols which creates unnecessary holes between data.

So drop ENTRY from saved_eip in wakeup_32 and many saved_* in wakeup_64,
as these symbols are local only.

One could've used SYM_DATA_LOCAL for these symbols, but it was
discouraged earlier:
