tee: optee: add TEE bus device enumeration support

OP-TEE provides a pseudo TA to enumerate TAs which can act as devices/
services for TEE bus. So implement device enumeration using invoke
function: PTA_CMD_GET_DEVICES provided by pseudo TA to fetch array of
device UUIDs. Also register these enumerated devices with TEE bus as
"optee-clntX" device.
