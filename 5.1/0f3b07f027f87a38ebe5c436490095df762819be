cfg80211: add and use strongly typed element iteration macros

Rather than always iterating elements from frames with pure
u8 pointers, add a type "struct element" that encapsulates
the id/datalen/data format of them.

Then, add the element iteration macros
 * for_each_element
 * for_each_element_id
 * for_each_element_extid

which take, as their first 'argument', such a structure and
iterate through a given u8 array interpreting it as elements.

While at it and since we'll need it, also add
 * for_each_subelement
 * for_each_subelement_id
 * for_each_subelement_extid

which instead of taking data/length just take an outer element
and use its data/datalen.

Also add for_each_element_completed() to determine if any of
the loops above completed, i.e. it was able to parse all of
the elements successfully and no data remained.

Use for_each_element_id() in cfg80211_find_ie_match() as the
first user of this.
