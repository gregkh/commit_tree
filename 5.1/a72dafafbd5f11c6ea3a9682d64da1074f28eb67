bpf: refactor verifier min/max code for condition jump

The current min/max code does both signed and unsigned comparisons against
the input argument "val" which is "u64" and there is explicit type casting
when the comparison is signed.

As we will need slightly more complexer type casting when JMP32 introduced,
it is better to host the signed type casting. This makes the code more
clean with ignorable runtime overhead.

Also, code for J*GE/GT/LT/LE and JEQ/JNE are very similar, this patch
combine them.

The main purpose for this refactor is to make sure the min/max code will
still be readable and with minimum code duplication after JMP32 introduced.
