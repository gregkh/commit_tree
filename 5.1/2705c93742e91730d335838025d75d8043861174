block: kill QUEUE_FLAG_NO_SG_MERGE

Since bdced438acd83ad83a6c ("block: setup bi_phys_segments after splitting"),
physical segment number is mainly figured out in blk_queue_split() for
fast path, and the flag of BIO_SEG_VALID is set there too.

Now only blk_recount_segments() and blk_recalc_rq_segments() use this
flag.

Basically blk_recount_segments() is bypassed in fast path given BIO_SEG_VALID
is set in blk_queue_split().

For another user of blk_recalc_rq_segments():

- run in partial completion branch of blk_update_request, which is an unusual case

- run in blk_cloned_rq_check_limits(), still not a big problem if the flag is killed
since dm-rq is the only user.

Multi-page bvec is enabled now, not doing S/G merging is rather pointless with the
current setup of the I/O path, as it isn't going to save you a significant amount
of cycles.
