ALSA: usb-audio: Cleanup DSD whitelist

XMOS/Thesycon family of USB Audio Class firmware flags DSD altsetting
separate from the PCM ones. Thus the DSD altsetting can be auto-detected
based on the flag and doesn't need maintaining specific altsetting
whitelist.

In addition, static VID:PID-to-altsetting whitelisting causes problems
when firmware update changes the altsetting, or same VID:PID is reused
for another device that has different kind of firmware.

This patch removes existing explicit whitelist mappings for XMOS VID
(0x20b1) and Thesycon VID (0x152a).

Also corrects placement of Hegel HD12 and NuPrime DAC-10 to keep list
sorted based on VID.
