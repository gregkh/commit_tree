vhost: silence an unused-variable warning

On some architectures, the MMU can be disabled, leading to access_ok()
becoming an empty macro that does not evaluate its size argument,
which in turn produces an unused-variable warning:

drivers/vhost/vhost.c:1191:9: error: unused variable 's' [-Werror,-Wunused-variable]
        size_t s = vhost_has_feature(vq, VIRTIO_RING_F_EVENT_IDX) ? 2 : 0;

Mark the variable as __maybe_unused to shut up that warning.
