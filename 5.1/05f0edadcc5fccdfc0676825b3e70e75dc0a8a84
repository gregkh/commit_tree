media: Revert "media: rc: some events are dropped by userspace"

When an rc device is created, we do not know what key codes it will
support, since a new keymap might be loaded at some later point. So,
we set all keybit in the input device.

The uevent for the input device includes all the key codes, of which
there are now 768. This overflows the size of the uevent
(UEVENT_BUFFER_SIZE) and no event is generated.

Revert for now until we figure out a different solution.

This reverts commit fec225a04330d0f222d24feb5bea045526031675.
