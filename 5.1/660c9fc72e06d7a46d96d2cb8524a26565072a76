autofs: clear O_NONBLOCK on the pipe

autofs does not expect the pipe it is given to have O_NONBLOCK set -
specifically if __kernel_write() in autofs_write() returns -EAGAIN, this
is treated as a fatal error and the pipe is closed.

For safety autofs should, therefore, clear the O_NONBLOCK flag.

Releases of systemd prior to 8th February 2019 used
  pipe2(p, O_NONBLOCK|O_CLOEXEC)
and thus (inadvertently) set this flag.
