perf cs-etm: Always allocate memory for cs_etm_queue::prev_packet

Robert Walker reported a segmentation fault is observed when process
CoreSight trace data; this issue can be easily reproduced by the command
'perf report --itrace=i1000i' for decoding tracing data.

If neither the 'b' flag (synthesize branches events) nor 'l' flag
(synthesize last branch entries) are specified to option '--itrace',
cs_etm_queue::prev_packet will not been initialised.  After merging the
code to support exception packets and sample flags, there introduced a
number of uses of cs_etm_queue::prev_packet without checking whether it
is valid, for these cases any accessing to uninitialised prev_packet
will cause crash.

As cs_etm_queue::prev_packet is used more widely now and it's already
hard to follow which functions have been called in a context where the
validity of cs_etm_queue::prev_packet has been checked, this patch
always allocates memory for cs_etm_queue::prev_packet.
