ARM: davinci: cp-intc: use the new-style config structure

Modify the cp-intc driver to take all its configuration from the new
config structure. Stop referencing davinci_soc_info in any way.
Move the declaration for davinci_cp_intc_init() to
irq-davinci-cp-intc.h and make it take the new config structure as
parameter. Convert all users to the new version.

Also: since the two da8xx SoCs default all irq priorities to 7, just
drop the priority configuration at all and hardcode the channels to 7.

It will simplify the driver code and make our lives easier when it
comes to device-tree support.
