kbuild: simplify single target rules

The dependency will be checked anyway after Kbuild descends into a
sub-directory. Skip object/source dependency checks in top Makefile.

VPATH can be simpler since the top Makefile no longer checks the
presence of the source file, which is located in in the external
module directory.

One good thing is, it can compile an object from a generated source
file.
