cpufreq: Reorder and simplify cpufreq_update_policy()

In cpufreq_update_policy(), instead of updating new_policy.cur
separately, which is kind of confusing, because cpufreq_set_policy()
doesn't take that value into account directly anyway, make the copy
of the existing policy after calling cpufreq_update_current_freq().

No intentional changes of behavior.
