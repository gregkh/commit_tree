regulator: axp20x: check rdev is null before dereferencing it

Currently rdev is dereferenced when assigning desc before rdev is null
checked, hence there is a potential null pointer dereference on rdev.
Fix this by null checking rdev first.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1476031 ("Dereference before null check")
