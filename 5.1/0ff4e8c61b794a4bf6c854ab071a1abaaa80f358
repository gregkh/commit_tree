ASoC: fsl_esai: fix channel swap issue when stream starts

There is very low possibility ( < 0.1% ) that channel swap happened
in beginning when multi output/input pin is enabled. The issue is
that hardware can't send data to correct pin in the beginning with
the normal enable flow.

This is hardware issue, but there is no errata, the workaround flow
is that: Each time playback/recording, firstly clear the xSMA/xSMB,
then enable TE/RE, then enable xSMB and xSMA (xSMB must be enabled
before xSMA). Which is to use the xSMA as the trigger start register,
previously the xCR_TE or xCR_RE is the bit for starting.

Fixes commit 43d24e76b698 ("ASoC: fsl_esai: Add ESAI CPU DAI driver")
