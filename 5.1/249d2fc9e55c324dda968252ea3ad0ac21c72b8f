ASoC: Intel: bytcht_es8316: Set card long_name based on quirks

Depending on the input-map and on if 1 or 2 speakers are connected,
userspace needs to use a different UCM profile.

Since we already deal with quirks in the kernel driver and set the
input-map from the kernel, add a quirk for devices with a single / mono
speaker and set the card's long_name based on the input and speaker
quirks, so that userspace can use the long_name to pick the right UCM
profile.

This change, including how the long_name is build-up mirrors how we do
this in the bytcr_rt5640 and bytcr_rt5651 machine drivers.

Note since all devices I have access to use a mono speaker setup I've
chosen to default the speaker setting to mono.
