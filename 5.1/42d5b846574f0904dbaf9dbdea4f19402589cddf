MIPS: mm: Unify ASID version checks

Introduce a new check_mmu_context() function to check an mm's ASID
version & get a new one if it's outdated, and a
check_switch_mmu_context() function which additionally sets up the new
ASID & page directory. Simplify switch_mm() & various
get_new_mmu_context() callsites in MIPS KVM by making use of the new
functions, which will help reduce the amount of code that requires
modification to gain MMID support.
