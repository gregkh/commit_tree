vt: refactor vc_ques to allow of other private sequences.

The vc_ques keeps track if a csi sequence is a private DEC control
function beginning with '?'. Nowadays some private control functions
begin with '>' and '='. Switch the code to instead use a new 3-bit
vc_priv that allows for all private use parameter prefixes.
