s390/3270: fix lockdep false positive on view->lock

The spinlock in the raw3270_view structure is used by con3270, tty3270
and fs3270 in different ways. For con3270 the lock can be acquired in
irq context, for tty3270 and fs3270 the highest context is bh.

Lockdep sees the view->lock as a single class and if the 3270 driver
is used for the console the following message is generated:

WARNING: inconsistent lock state
5.1.0-rc3-05157-g5c168033979d #12 Not tainted
--------------------------------
inconsistent {IN-HARDIRQ-W} -> {HARDIRQ-ON-W} usage.
swapper/0/1 [HC0[0]:SC1[1]:HE1:SE0] takes:
(____ptrval____) (&(&view->lock)->rlock){?.-.}, at: tty3270_update+0x7c/0x330

Introduce a lockdep subclass for the view lock to distinguish bh from
irq locks.
