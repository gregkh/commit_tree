drm/nouveau: Stop unsetting mstc->port, use malloc refs

Same as we did for i915, but for nouveau this time. Additionally, we
grab a malloc reference to the port that lasts for the entire lifetime
of nv50_mstc, which gives us the guarantee that mstc->port will always
point to valid memory for as long as the mstc stays around.
