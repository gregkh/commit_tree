sh_eth: rename sh_eth_cpu_data::hw_checksum

Commit 62e04b7e0e3c ("sh_eth: rename 'sh_eth_cpu_data::hw_crc'") renamed
the field to 'hw_checksum' for the Ether DMAC "intelligent checksum",
however some Ether MACs implement a simpler checksumming scheme, so that
name now seems misleading. Rename that field to 'csmr' as the "intelligent
checksum" is always controlled by the CSMR register.
