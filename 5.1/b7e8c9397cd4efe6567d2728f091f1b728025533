ARM: 8845/1: use unified assembler in c files

Use unified assembler syntax (UAL) in inline assembler. Divided
syntax is considered deprecated. This will also allow to build
the kernel using LLVM's integrated assembler.

When compiling non-Thumb2 GCC always emits a ".syntax divided"
at the beginning of the inline assembly which makes the
assembler fail. Since GCC 5 there is the -masm-syntax-unified
GCC option which make GCC assume unified syntax asm and hence
emits ".syntax unified" even in ARM mode. However, the option
is broken since GCC version 6 (see GCC PR88648 [1]). Work
around by adding ".syntax unified" as part of the inline
assembly.
