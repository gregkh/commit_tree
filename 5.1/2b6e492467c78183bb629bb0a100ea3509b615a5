device property: Fix the length used in PROPERTY_ENTRY_STRING()

With string type property entries we need to use
sizeof(const char *) instead of the number of characters as
the length of the entry.

If the string was shorter then sizeof(const char *),
attempts to read it would have failed with -EOVERFLOW. The
problem has been hidden because all build-in string
properties have had a string longer then 8 characters until
now.
