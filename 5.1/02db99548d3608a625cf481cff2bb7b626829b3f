nvmet: fix building bvec from sg list

There are two mistakes for building bvec from sg list for file
backed ns:

- use request data length to compute number of io vector, this way
doesn't consider sg->offset, and the result may be smaller than required
io vectors

- bvec->bv_len isn't capped by sg->length

This patch fixes this issue by building bvec from sg directly, given
the whole IO stack is ready for multi-page bvec.
