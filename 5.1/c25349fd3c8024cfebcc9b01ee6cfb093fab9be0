arm64: Skip irqflags tracing for NMI in IRQs disabled context

When an NMI is raised while interrupts where disabled, the IRQ tracing
already is in the correct state (i.e. hardirqs_off) and should be left
as such when returning to the interrupted context.

Check whether PMR was masking interrupts when the NMI was raised and
skip IRQ tracing if necessary.
