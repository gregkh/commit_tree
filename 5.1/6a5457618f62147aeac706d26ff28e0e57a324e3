samples/bpf: Extend RLIMIT_MEMLOCK for xdp_{sample_pkts, router_ipv4}

There is a common problem with xdp samples that happens when user wants
to run a particular sample and some bpf program is already loaded. The
default 64kb RLIMIT_MEMLOCK resource limit will cause a following error
(assuming that xdp sample that is failing was converted to libbpf
usage):

libbpf: Error in bpf_object__probe_name():Operation not permitted(1).
Couldn't load basic 'r0 = 0' BPF program.
libbpf: failed to load object './xdp_sample_pkts_kern.o'

Fix it in xdp_sample_pkts and xdp_router_ipv4 by setting RLIMIT_MEMLOCK
to RLIM_INFINITY.
