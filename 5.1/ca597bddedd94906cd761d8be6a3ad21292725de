f2fs: fix to dirty inode for i_mode recovery

As Seulbae Kim reported in bugzilla:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202637

We didn't recover permission field correctly after sudden power-cut,
the reason is in setattr we didn't add inode into global dirty list
once i_mode is changed, so latter checkpoint triggered by fsync will
not flush last i_mode into disk, result in this problem, fix it.
