drm/i915: Protect i915_active iterators from the shrinker

If we allocate while iterating the rbtree of active nodes, we may hit
the shrinker and so retire the i915_active, reaping the rbtree. Modifying
the rbtree as we iterate is not good behaviour, so acquire the
i915_active first to keep the tree intact whenever we allocate.
