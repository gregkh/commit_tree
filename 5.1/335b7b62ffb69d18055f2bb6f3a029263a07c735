CIFS: Respect reconnect in MTU credits calculations

Every time after a session reconnect we don't need to account for
credits obtained in previous sessions. Introduce new struct cifs_credits
which contains both credits value and reconnect instance of the
time those credits were taken. Modify a routine that add credits
back to handle the reconnect instance by assuming zero credits
if the reconnect happened after the credits were obtained and
before we decided to add them back due to some errors during sending.

This patch fixes the MTU credits cases. The subsequent patch
will handle non-MTU ones.
