scsi/atari_scsi: Don't select CONFIG_NVRAM

On powerpc, setting CONFIG_NVRAM=n builds a kernel with no NVRAM support.
Setting CONFIG_NVRAM=m enables the /dev/nvram misc device module without
enabling NVRAM support in drivers. Setting CONFIG_NVRAM=y enables the
misc device (built-in) and also enables NVRAM support in drivers.

m68k shares the valkyriefb driver with powerpc, and since that driver uses
NVRAM, it is affected by CONFIG_ATARI_SCSI, because of the use of
"select NVRAM". We can avoid the "select" here, but drivers still have
to interpret the CONFIG_NVRAM symbol consistently regardless of platform.

In this patch and the subsequent fbdev driver patch, the convention is
adopted across all relevant platforms whereby NVRAM functionality gets
enabled in a given device driver when the nvram misc device is built-in
or when both drivers are modules.
