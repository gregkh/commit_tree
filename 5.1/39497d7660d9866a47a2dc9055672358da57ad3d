KVM: lapic: Track lapic timer advance per vCPU

Automatically adjusting the globally-shared timer advancement could
corrupt the timer, e.g. if multiple vCPUs are concurrently adjusting
the advancement value.  That could be partially fixed by using a local
variable for the arithmetic, but it would still be susceptible to a
race when setting timer_advance_adjust_done.

And because virtual_tsc_khz and tsc_scaling_ratio are per-vCPU, the
correct calibration for a given vCPU may not apply to all vCPUs.

Furthermore, lapic_timer_advance_ns is marked __read_mostly, which is
effectively violated when finding a stable advancement takes an extended
amount of timer.

Opportunistically change the definition of lapic_timer_advance_ns to
a u32 so that it matches the style of struct kvm_timer.  Explicitly
pass the param to kvm_create_lapic() so that it doesn't have to be
exposed to lapic.c, thus reducing the probability of unintentionally
using the global value instead of the per-vCPU value.
