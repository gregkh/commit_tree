drm/dp/mst: Validate REMOTE_I2C_READ harder

Make sure i2c msgs we're asked to transfer conform to the
requirements of REMOTE_I2C_READ. We were only checking that the
last message is a read, but we must also check that the preceding
messages are all writes. Also check that the length of each
message isn't too long.
