clk: samsung: exynos5: Fix possible NULL pointer exception on platform_device_alloc() failure

During initialization of subdevices if platform_device_alloc() failed,
returned NULL pointer will be later dereferenced.  Add proper error
paths to exynos5_clk_register_subcmu().  The return value of this
function is still ignored because at this stage of init there is nothing
we can do.
