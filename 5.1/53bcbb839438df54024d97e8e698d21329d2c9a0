mtd: rawnand: denali_dt: remove single anonymous clock support

Commit 6f1fe97bec34 ("mtd: rawnand: denali_dt: add more clocks based
on IP datasheet") introduced a more correct binding that requires
three named clocks.

Now that all upstream DT files migrated over to it, remove the single
anonymous clock support.
