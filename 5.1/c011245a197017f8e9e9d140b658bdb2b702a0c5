ASoC: Intel: Add Geminilake Dialog Maxim machine driver

This patch enables support for GeminiLake with the DA7219 codec and
MAX98357A amplifier. To avoid duplicating code, the existing machine
driver for ApolloLake is reused with only changes in hardware
connectivity (SSP2 for DA7219 and SSP1 for MAX98357A).

The dailinks are directly modified in this patch. Using a helper would
be nicer, but it'll be done in a follow-up step with validation done
across multiple machine drivers.
