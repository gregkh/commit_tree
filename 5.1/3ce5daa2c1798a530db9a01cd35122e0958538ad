IB/hfi1: Add static trace for TID RDMA READ protocol

This patch makes the following changes to the static trace:
1. Adds the decoding of TID RDMA READ packets in IB header trace;
2. Tracks qpriv->s_flags and iow_flags in qpsleepwakeup trace;
3. Adds a new event to track RC ACK receiving;
4. Adds trace events for various stages of the TID RDMA READ
protocol. These events provide a fine-grained control for monitoring
and debugging the hfi1 driver in the filed.
