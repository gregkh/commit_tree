mm, memcg: create mem_cgroup_from_seq

This is the start of a series of patches similar to my earlier
DEFINE_MEMCG_MAX_OR_VAL work, but with less Macro Magic(tm).

There are a bunch of places we go from seq_file to mem_cgroup, which
currently requires manually getting the css, then getting the mem_cgroup
from the css.  It's in enough places now that having mem_cgroup_from_seq
makes sense (and also makes the next patch a bit nicer).
