rxrpc: Allow errors to be returned from rxrpc_queue_packet()

Change rxrpc_queue_packet()'s signature so that it can return any error
code it may encounter when trying to send the packet.

This allows the caller to eventually do something in case of error - though
it should be noted that the packet has been queued and a resend is
scheduled.
