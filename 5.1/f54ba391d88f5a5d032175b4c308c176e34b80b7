xsk: fix to reject invalid flags in xsk_bind

Passing a non-existing flag in the sxdp_flags member of struct
sockaddr_xdp was, incorrectly, silently ignored. This patch addresses
that behavior, and rejects any non-existing flags.

We have examined existing user space code, and to our best knowledge,
no one is relying on the current incorrect behavior. AF_XDP is still
in its infancy, so from our perspective, the risk of breakage is very
low, and addressing this problem now is important.
