mm/page_alloc.c: check return value of memblock_alloc_node_nopanic()

There are two early memory allocations that use
memblock_alloc_node_nopanic() and do not check its return value.

While this happens very early during boot and chances that the
allocation will fail are diminishing, it is still worth to have proper
checks for the allocation errors.
