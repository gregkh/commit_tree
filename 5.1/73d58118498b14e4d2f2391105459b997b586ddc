block, bfq: consider also ioprio classes in symmetry detection

In asymmetric scenarios, i.e., when some bfq_queue or bfq_group needs to
be guaranteed a different bandwidth than other bfq_queues or bfq_groups,
these service guaranteed can be provided only by plugging I/O dispatch,
completely or partially, when the queue in service remains temporarily
empty. A case where asymmetry is particularly strong is when some active
bfq_queues belong to a higher-priority class than some other active
bfq_queues. Unfortunately, this important case is not considered at all
in the code for detecting asymmetric scenarios. This commit adds the
missing logic.
