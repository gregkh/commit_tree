mfd: sta2x11: Drop unused MODULE_ tags from non-modular code

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/mfd/Kconfig:config MFD_STA2X11
drivers/mfd/Kconfig:    bool "STMicroelectronics STA2X11"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We replace module.h with init.h and export.h ; the latter since the
file does export some symbols.
