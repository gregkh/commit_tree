kasan: fix kasan_check_read/write definitions

Building little-endian allmodconfig kernels on arm64 started failing
with the generated atomic.h implementation, since we now try to call
kasan helpers from the EFI stub:

  aarch64-linux-gnu-ld: drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/arm-stub.stub.o: in function `atomic_set':
  include/generated/atomic-instrumented.h:44: undefined reference to `__efistub_kasan_check_write'

I suspect that we get similar problems in other files that explicitly
disable KASAN for some reason but call atomic_t based helper functions.

We can fix this by checking the predefined __SANITIZE_ADDRESS__ macro
that the compiler sets instead of checking CONFIG_KASAN, but this in
turn requires a small hack in mm/kasan/common.c so we do see the extern
declaration there instead of the inline function.
