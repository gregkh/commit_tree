drm/sun4i: frontend: Add support for planar YUV input formats

Planar YUV formats come with 3 distinct planes, which requires
configuring the frontend line stride and address registers for the
third plane.

Our hardware only supports the YUV planes order and in order to support
formats with a YVU plane order, a helper is introduced to indicate
whether to invert the address of the two chroma planes.

Missing definitions for YUV411 and YUV444 input format configuration are
also introduced as support is added for these formats. For the input
sequence part, no configuration is required for planar YUV formats so
zero is returned in that case.
