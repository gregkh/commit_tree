mm: create the new vm_fault_t type

Page fault handlers are supposed to return VM_FAULT codes, but some
drivers/file systems mistakenly return error numbers.  Now that all
drivers/file systems have been converted to use the vm_fault_t return
type, change the type definition to no longer be compatible with 'int'.
By making it an unsigned int, the function prototype becomes
incompatible with a function which returns int.  Sparse will detect any
attempts to return a value which is not a VM_FAULT code.

VM_FAULT_SET_HINDEX and VM_FAULT_GET_HINDEX values are changed to avoid
conflict with other VM_FAULT codes.
