xfs: check the ir_startino alignment directly

In xchk_iallocbt_rec, check the alignment of ir_startino by converting
the inode cluster block alignment into units of inodes instead of the
other way around (converting ir_startino to blocks).  This prevents us
from tripping over off-by-one errors in ir_startino which are obscured
by the inode -> block conversion.
