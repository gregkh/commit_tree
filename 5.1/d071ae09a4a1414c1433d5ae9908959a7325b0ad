x86/build: Mark per-CPU symbols as absolute explicitly for LLD

Accessing per-CPU variables is done by finding the offset of the
variable in the per-CPU block and adding it to the address of the
respective CPU's block.

Section 3.10.8 of ld.bfd's documentation states:

  For expressions involving numbers, relative addresses and absolute
  addresses, ld follows these rules to evaluate terms:

  Other binary operations, that is, between two relative addresses
  not in the same section, or between a relative address and an
  absolute address, first convert any non-absolute term to an
  absolute address before applying the operator."

Note that LLVM's linker does not adhere to the GNU ld's implementation
and as such requires implicitly-absolute terms to be explicitly marked
as absolute in the linker script. If not, it fails currently with:

  ld.lld: error: ./arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux.lds:153: at least one side of the expression must be absolute
  ld.lld: error: ./arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux.lds:154: at least one side of the expression must be absolute
  Makefile:1040: recipe for target 'vmlinux' failed

This is not a functional change for ld.bfd which converts the term to an
absolute symbol anyways as specified above.
