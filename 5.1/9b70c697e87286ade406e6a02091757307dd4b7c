clk: meson-gxbb: round the vdec dividers to closest

We want the video decoder clocks to always round to closest. While the
muxes are already using CLK_MUX_ROUND_CLOSEST, the corresponding
CLK_DIVIDER_ROUND_CLOSEST was forgotten for the dividers.

Fix this by adding the flag to the two vdec dividers.
