binder: add functions to copy to/from binder buffers

Avoid vm_area when copying to or from binder buffers.
Instead, new copy functions are added that copy from
kernel space to binder buffer space. These use
kmap_atomic() and kunmap_atomic() to create temporary
mappings and then memcpy() is used to copy within
that page.

Also, kmap_atomic() / kunmap_atomic() use the appropriate
cache flushing to support VIVT cache architectures.
Allow binder to build if CPU_CACHE_VIVT is defined.

Several uses of the new functions are added here. More
to follow in subsequent patches.
