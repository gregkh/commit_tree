arm64: dts: apq8016-sbc: Increase load on l11 for SDCARD

In the same way as for msm8974-hammerhead, l11 load, used for SDCARD
VMMC, needs to be increased in order to prevent any voltage drop issues
(due to limited current) happening with some SDCARDS or during specific
operations (e.g. write).

Tested on Dragonboard-410c and DART-SD410 boards.

Fixes: 4c7d53d16d77 (arm64: dts: apq8016-sbc: add regulators support)
