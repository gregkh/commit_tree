net: Change TCA_ACT_* to TCA_ID_* to match that of TCA_ID_POLICE

Modify the kernel users of the TCA_ACT_* macros to use TCA_ID_*. For
example, use TCA_ID_GACT instead of TCA_ACT_GACT. This will align with
TCA_ID_POLICE and also differentiates these identifier, used in struct
tc_action_ops type field, from other macros starting with TCA_ACT_.

To make things clearer, we name the enum defining the TCA_ID_*
identifiers and also change the "type" field of struct tc_action to
id.
