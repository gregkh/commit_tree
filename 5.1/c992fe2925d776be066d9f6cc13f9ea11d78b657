io_uring: add fsync support

Add a new fsync opcode, which either syncs a range if one is passed,
or the whole file if the offset and length fields are both cleared
to zero.  A flag is provided to use fdatasync semantics, that is only
force out metadata which is required to retrieve the file data, but
not others like metadata.
