dm: update dm_process_bio() to split bio if in ->make_request_fn()

Must call blk_queue_split() otherwise queue_limits for abnormal requests
(e.g. discard, writesame, etc) won't be imposed.

In addition, add dm_queue_split() to simplify DM specific splitting that
is needed for targets that impose ti->max_io_len.
