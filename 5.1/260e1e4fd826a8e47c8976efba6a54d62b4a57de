rcu: Discard separate per-CPU callback counts

Back when there were multiple flavors of RCU, it was necessary to
separately count lazy and non-lazy callbacks for each CPU.  These counts
were used in CONFIG_RCU_FAST_NO_HZ kernels to determine how long a newly
idle CPU should be allowed to sleep before handling its RCU callbacks.
But now that there is only one flavor, the callback counts for a given
CPU's sole rcu_data structure are the counts for that CPU.

This commit therefore removes the rcu_data structure's ->nonlazy_posted
and ->nonlazy_posted_snap fields, the rcu_idle_count_callbacks_posted()
and rcu_cpu_has_callbacks() functions, repurposes the rcu_data structure's
->all_lazy field to record the laziness state at the beginning of the
latest idle sojourn, and modifies CONFIG_RCU_FAST_NO_HZ RCU CPU stall
warnings accordingly.
