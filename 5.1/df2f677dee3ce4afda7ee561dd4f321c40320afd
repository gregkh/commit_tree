tools/power turbostat: Restore ability to execute in topology-order

turbostat executes on CPUs in "topology order".
This is an optimization for measuring profoundly idle systems --
as the closest hardware is woken next...

Fix a typo that was added with the sub-die-node support,
that broke topology ordering on multi-node systems.
