doc: Change LXR references to elixir.bootlin.com

Recently, Free Electrons was renamed to Bootlin[1]. Less recently, the
Linux Cross Reference (LXR) at lxr.free-electrons.com was replaced by
Elixir[2], and lxr.free-electrons.com redirected first to
elixir.free-electrons.com and now to elixir.bootlin.com.
