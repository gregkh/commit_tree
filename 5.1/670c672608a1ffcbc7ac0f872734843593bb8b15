soc: bcm: bcm2835-pm: Add support for power domains under a new binding.

This provides a free software alternative to raspberrypi-power.c's
firmware calls to manage power domains.  It also exposes a reset line,
where previously the vc4 driver had to try to force power off the
domain in order to trigger a reset.
