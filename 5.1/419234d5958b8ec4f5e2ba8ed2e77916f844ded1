fuse: only reuse auxiliary request in fuse_writepage_in_flight()

Don't reuse the queued request, even if it only contains a single page.
This is needed because previous locking changes (spliting out
fiq->waitq.lock from fc->lock) broke the assumption that request will
remain in FR_PENDING at least until the new page contents are copied.

This fix removes a slight optimization for a rare corner case, so we really
shoudln't care.
