RDMA: Provide safe ib_alloc_device() function

All callers to ib_alloc_device() provide a larger size than struct
ib_device and rely on the fact that struct ib_device is embedded in their
driver specific structure as the first member.

Provide a safer variant of ib_alloc_device() that checks and enforces this
approach to make sure the drivers are using it right.
