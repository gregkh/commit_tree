mm/debug.c: fix __dump_page when mapping->host is not set

While debugging something, I added a dump_page() into do_swap_page(),
and I got the splat from below.  The issue happens when dereferencing
mapping->host in __dump_page():

  ...
  else if (mapping) {
	pr_warn("%ps ", mapping->a_ops);
	if (mapping->host->i_dentry.first) {
		struct dentry *dentry;
		dentry = container_of(mapping->host->i_dentry.first, struct dentry, d_u.d_alias);
		pr_warn("name:\"%pd\" ", dentry);
	}
  }
  ...

Swap address space does not contain an inode information, and so
mapping->host equals NULL.

Although the dump_page() call was added artificially into
do_swap_page(), I am not sure if we can hit this from any other path, so
it looks worth fixing it.  We can easily do that by checking
mapping->host first.
