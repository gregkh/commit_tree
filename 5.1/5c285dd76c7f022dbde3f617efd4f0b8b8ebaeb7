powerpc/dts: Standardize DTS status assignments from "ok" to "okay"

While the current kernel drivers/of/ code allows developers to be
sloppy and use a DTS status value of "ok", the current DTSpec 0.1
makes it clear that the proper spelling is "okay", so fix the small
number of PowerPC .dts files that do this.
