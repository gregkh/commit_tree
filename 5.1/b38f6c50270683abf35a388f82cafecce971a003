XArray: Fix xa_release in allocating arrays

xa_cmpxchg() was a little too magic in turning ZERO entries into NULL,
and would leave the entry set to the ZERO entry instead of releasing
it for future use.  After careful review of existing users of
xa_cmpxchg(), change the semantics so that it does not translate either
incoming argument from NULL into ZERO entries.

Add several tests to the test-suite to make sure this problem doesn't
come back.
