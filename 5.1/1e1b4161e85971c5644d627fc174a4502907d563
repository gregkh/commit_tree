rsi: Suppress sdhci warnings in mmc

while inserting and removing sdio module multiple times, we are getting
sdhci warnings. This is because, improper assignment of ocr_avail value.
Fixed this by assigning proper value.

This patch is enhancement for commit 78e450719c702 ("rsi: Fix 'invalid
vdd' warning in mmc").
