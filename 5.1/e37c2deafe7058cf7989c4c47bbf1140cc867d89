ASoC: stm32: sai: fix master clock management

When master clock is used, master clock rate is set exclusively.
Parent clocks of master clock cannot be changed after a call to
clk_set_rate_exclusive(). So the parent clock of SAI kernel clock
must be set before.
Ensure also that exclusive rate operations are balanced
in STM32 SAI driver.
