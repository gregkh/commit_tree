LSM: Revive CONFIG_DEFAULT_SECURITY_* for "make oldconfig"

Commit 70b62c25665f636c ("LoadPin: Initialize as ordered LSM") removed
CONFIG_DEFAULT_SECURITY_{SELINUX,SMACK,TOMOYO,APPARMOR,DAC} from
security/Kconfig and changed CONFIG_LSM to provide a fixed ordering as a
default value. That commit expected that existing users (upgrading from
Linux 5.0 and earlier) will edit CONFIG_LSM value in accordance with
their CONFIG_DEFAULT_SECURITY_* choice in their old kernel configs. But
since users might forget to edit CONFIG_LSM value, this patch revives
the choice (only for providing the default value for CONFIG_LSM) in order
to make sure that CONFIG_LSM reflects CONFIG_DEFAULT_SECURITY_* from their
old kernel configs.

Note that since TOMOYO can be fully stacked against the other legacy
major LSMs, when it is selected, it explicitly disables the other LSMs
to avoid them also initializing since TOMOYO does not expect this
currently.
