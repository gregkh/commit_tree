mfd: db8500-prcmu: Drop unused MODULE_ tags from non-modular code

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/mfd/Kconfig:config MFD_DB8500_PRCMU
drivers/mfd/Kconfig:    bool "ST-Ericsson DB8500 Power Reset Control Management Unit"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.

We replace module.h with init.h and export.h ; the latter since the
file does export some symbols.
