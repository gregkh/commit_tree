cifs: allow guest mounts to work for smb3.11

Fix Guest/Anonymous sessions so that they work with SMB 3.11.

The commit noted below tightened the conditions and forced signing for
the SMB2-TreeConnect commands as per MS-SMB2.
However, this should only apply to normal user sessions and not for
Guest/Anonumous sessions.

Fixes: 6188f28bf608 ("Tree connect for SMB3.1.1 must be signed for non-encrypted shares")
