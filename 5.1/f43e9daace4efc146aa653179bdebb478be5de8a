kallsyms: add static qualifiers where missing

Fix the following sparse warnings:

scripts/kallsyms.c:65:5: warning: symbol 'token_profit' was not declared. Should it be static?
scripts/kallsyms.c:68:15: warning: symbol 'best_table' was not declared. Should it be static?
scripts/kallsyms.c:69:15: warning: symbol 'best_table_len' was not declared. Should it be static?

Also, remove 'inline' from is_arm_mapping_symbol(). The compiler
will inline it anyway when it is appropriate to do so.
