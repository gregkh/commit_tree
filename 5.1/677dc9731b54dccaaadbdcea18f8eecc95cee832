mm, memcg: extract memcg maxable seq_file logic to seq_show_memcg_tunable

memcg has a significant number of files exposed to kernfs where their
value is either exposed directly or is "max" in the case of
PAGE_COUNTER_MAX.

This patch makes this generic by providing a single function to do this
work.  In combination with the previous patch adding
mem_cgroup_from_seq, this makes all of the seq_show feeder functions
significantly more simple.
