ata: pata_of_platform: Allow to use 16-bit wide data transfer

In some cases, the system bus can be configured for 16-bit mode,
in this case using read/write functions for 32-bit values
results in two cycles of 16 bits each, which is wrong.
This patch adds the devicetree flag to switch the driver to
use 16-bit mode for I/O transfers.
