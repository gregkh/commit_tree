KVM: nVMX: Expose RDPMC-exiting only when guest supports PMU

Issue was discovered when running kvm-unit-tests on KVM running as L1 on
top of Hyper-V.

When vmx_instruction_intercept unit-test attempts to run RDPMC to test
RDPMC-exiting, it is intercepted by L1 KVM which it's EXIT_REASON_RDPMC
handler raise #GP because vCPU exposed by Hyper-V doesn't support PMU.
Instead of unit-test expectation to be reflected with EXIT_REASON_RDPMC.

The reason vmx_instruction_intercept unit-test attempts to run RDPMC
even though Hyper-V doesn't support PMU is because L1 expose to L2
support for RDPMC-exiting. Which is reasonable to assume that is
supported only in case CPU supports PMU to being with.

Above issue can easily be simulated by modifying
vmx_instruction_intercept config in x86/unittests.cfg to run QEMU with
"-cpu host,+vmx,-pmu" and run unit-test.

To handle issue, change KVM to expose RDPMC-exiting only when guest
supports PMU.
