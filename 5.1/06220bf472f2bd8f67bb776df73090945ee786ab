perf cs-etm: Set sample flags for instruction range packet

The perf sample data contains flags to indicate the hardware trace data
is belonging to which type branch instruction, thus this can be used to
print out the human readable string.  Arm CoreSight ETM sample data is
missed to set flags and it is always set to zeros, this results in perf
tool skips to print string for instruction types.

This patch is to set branch instruction flags for instruction range
packet.
