net: Introduce ndo_get_port_parent_id()

In preparation for getting rid of switchdev_ops, create a dedicated NDO
operation for getting the port's parent identifier. There are
essentially two classes of drivers that need to implement getting the
port's parent ID which are VF/PF drivers with a built-in switch, and
pure switchdev drivers such as mlxsw, ocelot, dsa etc.

We introduce a helper function: dev_get_port_parent_id() which supports
recursion into the lower devices to obtain the first port's parent ID.

Convert the bridge, core and ipv4 multicast routing code to check for
such ndo_get_port_parent_id() and call the helper function when valid
before falling back to switchdev_port_attr_get(). This will allow us to
convert all relevant drivers in one go instead of having to implement
both switchdev_port_attr_get() and ndo_get_port_parent_id() operations,
then get rid of switchdev_port_attr_get().
