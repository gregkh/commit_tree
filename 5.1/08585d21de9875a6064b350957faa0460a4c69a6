arm64: dts: sdm845: Fixup dependency on RPMPD includes

This patch fixes a dependency issue with the RPMPD dt bindings.  This
temporarily removes the include file and adds hardcoded values for the
OPPs until the other changes full land.  This will be addressed in 5.2.

Fixes: 5b6f186f0abb ("arm64: dts: sdm845: Add rpmh powercontroller node")
