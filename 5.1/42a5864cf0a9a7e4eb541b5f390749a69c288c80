perf stat: Improve scaling

The multiplexing scaling in perf stat mysteriously adds 0.5 to the
value. This dates back to the original perf tool. Other scaling code
doesn't use that strange convention. Remove the extra 0.5.

Before:

$ perf stat -e 'cycles,cycles,cycles,cycles,cycles,cycles' grep -rq foo

 Performance counter stats for 'grep -rq foo':

         6,403,580      cycles                                                        (81.62%)
         6,404,341      cycles                                                        (81.64%)
         6,402,983      cycles                                                        (81.62%)

         6,399,451      cycles                                                        (81.62%)
