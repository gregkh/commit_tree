perf bpf: Fix synthesized PERF_RECORD_KSYMBOL/BPF_EVENT

Added missing machine->id_hdr_size to event->header.size. Also fixed
size of PERF_RECORD_KSYMBOL by removing extra bytes for name.

Committer notes:

We need to malloc that extra machine->id_hdr_size at the start of
perf_event__synthesize_bpf_events() and also need to cast the event to
(void *) otherwise we segfault, fix it.
