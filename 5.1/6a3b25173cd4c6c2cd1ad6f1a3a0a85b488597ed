arch: arm: dts: kirkwood-rd88f6281: Remove disabled marvell,dsa reference

marvell,dsa properties has been removed from kirkwood-rd88f6281.dtsi
while cleanuping the dsa binding, but the dsa reference in
kirkwood-rd88f6281-z0.dts has been missed causing the following errors:

arch/arm/boot/dts/kirkwood-rd88f6281-z0.dts:21.4-16: Warning (reg_format): /dsa/switch@0:reg: property has invalid length (8 bytes) (#address-cells == 2, #size-cells == 1)
arch/arm/boot/dts/kirkwood-rd88f6281-z0.dts:23.5-15: Warning (reg_format): /dsa/switch@0/port@4:reg: property has invalid length (4 bytes) (#address-cells == 2, #size-cells == 1)

So remove the dsa reference too in order to fix this issue.
