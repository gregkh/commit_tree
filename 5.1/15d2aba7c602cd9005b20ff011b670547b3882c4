PCI/portdrv: Use shared MSI/MSI-X vector for Bandwidth Management

The Interrupt Message Number in the PCIe Capabilities register (PCIe r4.0,
sec 7.5.3.2) indicates which MSI/MSI-X vector is shared by interrupts
related to the PCIe Capability, including Link Bandwidth Management and
Link Autonomous Bandwidth Interrupts (Link Control, 7.5.3.7), Command
Completed and Hot-Plug Interrupts (Slot Control, 7.5.3.10), and the PME
Interrupt (Root Control, 7.5.3.12).

pcie_message_numbers() checked whether we want to enable PME or Hot-Plug
interrupts but neglected to check for Link Bandwidth Management, so if we
only wanted the Bandwidth Management interrupts, it decided we didn't need
any vectors at all.  Then pcie_port_enable_irq_vec() tried to reallocate
zero vectors, which failed, resulting in fallback to INTx.

On some systems, e.g., an X79-based workstation, that INTx seems broken or
not handled correctly, so we got spurious IRQ16 interrupts for Bandwidth
Management events.

Change pcie_message_numbers() so that if we want Link Bandwidth Management
interrupts, we use the shared MSI/MSI-X vector from the PCIe Capabilities
register.
