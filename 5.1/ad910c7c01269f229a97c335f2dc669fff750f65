net/core: work around section mismatch warning for ptp_classifier

The routine ptp_classifier_init() uses an initializer for an
automatic struct type variable which refers to an __initdata
symbol. This is perfectly legal, but may trigger a section
mismatch warning when running the compiler in -fpic mode, due
to the fact that the initializer may be emitted into an anonymous
.data section thats lack the __init annotation. So work around it
by using assignments instead.
