kbuild: gitignore output directory

When compiling into output directory using O=, many files
created under KBUILD_OUTPUT that git considers
as new ones; git clients, ex. "git gui" lists it, and it clutters
file list making it difficult to see what was really changed

Generate .gitignore in output directory that ignores all
its content
