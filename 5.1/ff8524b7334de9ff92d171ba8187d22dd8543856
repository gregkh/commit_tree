ARM: defconfig: Switch LPC32xx to use PL11x DRM driver

None of the LPC32xx device trees contains any display settings,
it just defines a device tree node for the CLCD (PL11x) left
as "disabled" on lpc3250-ea3250 and "okay" on lpc3250-phy3250
but no panels are attached on any device tree, so the driver
will simply bail out.

I conclude that the hardware is dormant on existing
systems, so we can without any problems switch the defconfig
over from the old ARMCLCD frame buffer driver to the new
PL11x DRM driver.
