spmi: pmic-arb: validate type when mapping IRQ

qpnpint_irq_domain_map did not validate the IRQ type and this can cause
IRQs to not work as expected if an unsupported type (such as
IRQ_TYPE_NONE) is passed in. Now that spmi-gpio is a hierarchical IRQ
controller, and all device tree bindings have been updated, add
additional validation to the type field.
