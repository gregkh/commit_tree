IB/hfi1: Add a function to receive TID RDMA WRITE DATA packet

This patch adds a function to receive TID RDMA WRITE DATA packet,
which is in the KDETH PSN space in packet ordering. Due to the use
of header suppression, software is generally only notified when
the last data packet for a segment is received. This patch also
adds code to handle KDETH EFLAGS errors for ingress TID RDMA WRITE
DATA packets.
