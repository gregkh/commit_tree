ASoC: sun4i-codec: Add Mic1 Boost Volume, Mic2 Boost Volume

Add Mic1 Boost Volume and Mic2 Boost Volume for Allwinner A10 and for
Allwinner A20.

Those controls are in different registers per chip model, so put the
Allwinner A10 controls and the Allwinner A20 controls into the newly
split sun4i_codec_controls and sun7i_codec_controls, respectively.
