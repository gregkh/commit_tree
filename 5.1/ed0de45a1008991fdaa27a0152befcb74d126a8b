ipv4: recompile ip options in ipv4_link_failure

Recompile IP options since IPCB may not be valid anymore when
ipv4_link_failure is called from arp_error_report.

Refer to the commit 3da1ed7ac398 ("net: avoid use IPCB in cipso_v4_error")
and the commit before that (9ef6b42ad6fd) for a similar issue.
