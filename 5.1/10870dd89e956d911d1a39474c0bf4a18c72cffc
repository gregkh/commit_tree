netfilter: nf_tables: add direct calls for all builtin expressions

With CONFIG_RETPOLINE its faster to add an if (ptr == &foo_func)
check and and use direct calls for all the built-in expressions.

~15% improvement in pathological cases.

checkpatch doesn't like the X macro due to the embedded return statement,
but the macro has a very limited scope so I don't think its a problem.

I would like to avoid bugs of the form
  If (e->ops->eval == (unsigned long)nft_foo_eval)
	 nft_bar_eval();

and open-coded if ()/else if()/else cascade, thus the macro.
