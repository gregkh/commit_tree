ASoC: Intel: sst: Fallback to BYT-CR if IRQ 5 is missing

Some devices detected as BYT-T by the PMIC-type based detection
have only a single IRQ listed in the 80860F28 ACPI device. This
causes -ENXIO later when attempting to get the IRQ at index 5.
It turns out these devices behave more like BYT-CR devices,
and using the IRQ at index 0 makes sound work correctly.

This patch adds a fallback for these devices to is_byt_cr():
If there is no IRQ resource at index 5, treating the device
as BYT-T is guaranteed to fail later, so we can safely treat
these devices as BYT-CR without breaking any working device.
