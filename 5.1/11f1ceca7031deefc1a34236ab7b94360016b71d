interconnect: Add generic on-chip interconnect API

This patch introduces a new API to get requirements and configure the
interconnect buses across the entire chipset to fit with the current
demand.

The API is using a consumer/provider-based model, where the providers are
the interconnect buses and the consumers could be various drivers.
The consumers request interconnect resources (path) between endpoints and
set the desired constraints on this data flow path. The providers receive
requests from consumers and aggregate these requests for all master-slave
pairs on that path. Then the providers configure each node along the path
to support a bandwidth that satisfies all bandwidth requests that cross
through that node. The topology could be complicated and multi-tiered and
is SoC specific.
