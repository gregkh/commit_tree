ASoC: Intel: Boards: Add Maxim98373 support

This patch enables the reuse of kbl_da7219_max98927 machine driver to
support max98373. The same machine driver is modified for cases where one
amplifier is swapped out with another. Most of the changes are about
renaming the codec and codec_dai names, with minor differences due to
support for 24 bits in one case and 16 in the other.
