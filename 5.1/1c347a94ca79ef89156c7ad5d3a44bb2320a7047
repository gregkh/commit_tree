tracing: Comment why cond_snapshot is checked outside of max_lock protection

Before setting tr->cond_snapshot, it must be NULL before it can be updated.
It can go to NULL when a trace event hist trigger is created or removed, and
can only be modified under the max_lock spin lock. But because it can only
be set to something other than NULL under both the max_lock spin lock as
well as the trace_types_lock, we can perform the check if it is not NULL
only under the trace_types_lock and fail out without having to grab the
max_lock spin lock.

This is very subtle, and deserves a comment.
