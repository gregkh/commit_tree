drm/irq: Don't check for DRIVER_HAVE_IRQ in drm_irq_(un)install

If a non-legacy driver calls these it's valid to assume there is
interrupt support. The flag is really only needed for legacy drivers,
which control IRQ enabling/disabling through the DRM_IOCTL_CONTROL
legacy IOCTL.

Also remove all the flag usage from non-legacy drivers.

v2: Review from Emil:
- improve commit message
- I forgot hibmc, fix that
