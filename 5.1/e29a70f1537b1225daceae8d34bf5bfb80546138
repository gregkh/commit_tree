checkpatch: add some new alloc functions to various tests

Many new generic allocation functions like the kvmalloc family have been
added recently to the kernel.

The allocation functions test now includes:

o kvmalloc and variants
o kstrdup_const
o kmemdup_nul
o dma_alloc_coherent
o alloc_skb and variants

Add a separate $allocFunctions variable to help make the allocation
functions test a bit more readable.

Miscellanea:

o Use $allocFunctions in the unnecessary OOM message test and
  add exclude uses with __GFP_NOWARN
o Use $allocFunctions in the unnecessary cast test
o Add the kvmalloc family to the preferred sizeof alloc style
  foo = kvmalloc(sizeof(*foo), ...)
