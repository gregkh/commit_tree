cfg80211: Change an 'else if' into an 'else' in cfg80211_calculate_bitrate_he

When building with -Wsometimes-uninitialized, Clang warns:

net/wireless/util.c:1223:11: warning: variable 'result' is used
uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is false
[-Wsometimes-uninitialized]

Clang can't evaluate at this point that WARN(1, ...) always returns true
because __ret_warn_on is defined as !!(condition), which isn't
immediately evaluated as 1. Change this branch to else so that it's
clear to Clang that we intend to bail out here.
