NFS: Forbid setting AF_INET6 to "struct sockaddr_in"->sin_family.

syzbot is reporting uninitialized value at rpc_sockaddr2uaddr() [1]. This
is because syzbot is setting AF_INET6 to "struct sockaddr_in"->sin_family
(which is embedded into user-visible "struct nfs_mount_data" structure)
despite nfs23_validate_mount_data() cannot pass sizeof(struct sockaddr_in6)
bytes of AF_INET6 address to rpc_sockaddr2uaddr().

Since "struct nfs_mount_data" structure is user-visible, we can't change
"struct nfs_mount_data" to use "struct sockaddr_storage". Therefore,
assuming that everybody is using AF_INET family when passing address via
"struct nfs_mount_data"->addr, reject if its sin_family is not AF_INET.
