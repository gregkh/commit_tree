misc: hpilo: Do not claim unsupported hardware

CL2600/CL2800 servers leveraged Proliant hardware but are targeted to a
different market segment and come with a different firmware base. Based
upon targeted market needs, the servers de-featured certain aspects of iLO.

As a result, hpilo driver still claims the hardware but is not functional,
so we decided to blacklist it with SSID 0x0289 to reduce confusion to
customers.
