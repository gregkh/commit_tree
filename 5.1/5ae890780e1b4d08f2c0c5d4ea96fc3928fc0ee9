staging: most: cdev: add missing check for cdev_add failure

Currently the call to cdev_add is missing a check for failure. Fix this by
checking for failure and exiting via a new error path that ensures the
allocated comp_channel struct is kfree'd.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1462359 ("Unchecked return value")
