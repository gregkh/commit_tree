net: hns3: fix setting of the hns reset_type for rdma hw errors

Presently the hns reset_type for the roce errors is set
in the hclge_log_and_clear_rocee_ras_error function.
This function is also called to detect and clear roce errors
while enabling the rdma error interrupts. However there is no hns
reset requested for this case. This can cause issue of wrong
reset_type used with subsequent hns reset as the
reset_type set in the above case was not cleared.

This patch moves setting of hns reset_type for the roce errors from
hclge_log_and_clear_rocee_ras_error function
to hclge_handle_rocee_ras_error.
