cpuidle: dt: bail out if the idle-state DT node is not compatible

Currently, the DT of the idle states will be parsed first whether it's
compatible or not. This could cause a warning message that comes from if
the CPU doesn't support identical idle states. E.g. Tegra186 can run
with 2 Cortex-A57 and 2 Denver cores with different idle states on
different types of these cores.

So fix it by checking the match node earlier, then it can make sure it
only goes through the idle states that the CPU supported.
