brcmfmac: Add DMI nvram filename quirk for PoV TAB-P1006W-232 tablet

The Point of View TAB-P1006W-232 tablet contains quite generic names in
the sys_vendor and product_name DMI strings, without this patch brcmfmac
will try to load: brcmfmac43340-sdio.Insyde-BayTrail.txt as nvram file
which is a bit too generic.

Add a DMI quirk so that a unique and clearly identifiable nvram file
name is used on the PoV TAB-P1006W-232 tablet.
