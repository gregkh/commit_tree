Revert "drm/virtio: drop prime import/export callbacks"

This patch does more harm than good, as it breaks both Xwayland and
gnome-shell with X11.

Xwayland requires DRI3 & DRI3 requires PRIME.

X11 crash for obscure double-free reason which are hard to debug
(starting X11 by hand doesn't trigger the crash).

I don't see an apparent problem implementing those stub prime
functions, they may return an error at run-time, and it seems to be
handled fine by GNOME at least.

This reverts commit b318e3ff7ca065d6b107e424c85a63d7a6798a69.
[airlied:
This broke userspace for virtio-gpus, and regressed things from DRI3 to DRI2.

This brings back the original problem, but it's better than regressions.]
