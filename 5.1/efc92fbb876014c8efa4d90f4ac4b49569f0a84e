spi: atmel: Convert to use CS GPIO descriptors

This converts the Atmel SPI master driver to use GPIO descriptors
for chip select handling.

The Atmel driver has duplicate code to look up and initialize CS
GPIOs from the device tree, so this is removed. It further has code
to retrieve a CS GPIO from .controller_data but this seems to be
completely unused in the kernel (legacy codepath?) so I deleted
this support. It keeps track of polarity when switching the CS, but
this is not needed anymore since we moved this over to the gpiolib.

The local handling of the "npcs_pin" (I guess this might mean
"negative polarity chip select pin") is preserved, but I strongly
suspect this can be switched over to handling by the core and
using the SPI_MASTER_GPIO_SS flag on the master to assure that
the additional CS handling in the driver is also done.
