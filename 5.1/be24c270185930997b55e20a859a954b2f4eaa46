tty: serial: msm_serial: Remove __init from msm_console_setup()

Due to the complexities of modern Qualcomm SoCs, about a half dozen drivers
must successfully probe before the clocks for the console are present, and
the console can successfully probe.  Depending on several random factors
such as probe order and modules vs builtin, msm_serial may not be able to
successfully probe for some, at which point, __init annotated functions
may become unmapped.  If this occurs, msm_console_setup() will be called
from the probe path, but will no longer exist, resulting in a kernel
panic.

Resolve this issue by removing the __init annotation from
msm_console_setup().
