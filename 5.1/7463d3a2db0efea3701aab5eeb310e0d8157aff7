tls: Fix write space handling

TLS device cannot use the sw context. This patch returns the original
tls device write space handler and moves the sw/device specific portions
to the relevant files.

Also, we remove the write_space call for the tls_sw flow, because it
handles partial records in its delayed tx work handler.
