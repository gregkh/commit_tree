ARM: dts: sun9i: cubieboard4: Add GPIO pin-bank regulator supplies

The Cubieboard 4 has the PMIC providing voltage to all the pin-bank
supply rails from its various regulator outputs. All pin-banks that
have supply rails are accounted for. PN pin-bank does not have a
supply rail.

Also remove any "regulator-always-on" properties from regulators that
were only marked to provide pin-bank power.
