platform/x86: wmi: fix potential null pointer dereference

In the function wmi_dev_match() the variable id is dereferenced without
first performing a NULL check. The variable can for example be NULL if
a WMI driver is registered without specifying the id_table field in
struct wmi_driver.

Add a NULL check and return that the driver can't handle the device if
the variable is NULL.
