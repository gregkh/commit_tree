crypto: testmgr - add iv_out to all CTR test vectors

Test that all CTR implementations update the IV buffer to contain the
next counter block, aka the IV to continue the encryption/decryption of
a larger message.  When the length processed is a multiple of the block
size, users may rely on this for chaining.

When the length processed is *not* a multiple of the block size, simple
chaining doesn't work.  However, as noted in commit 88a3f582bea9
("crypto: arm64/aes - don't use IV buffer to return final keystream
block"), the generic CCM implementation assumes that the CTR IV is
handled in some sane way, not e.g. overwritten with part of the
keystream.  Since this was gotten wrong once already, it's desirable to
test for it.  And, the most straightforward way to do this is to enforce
that all CTR implementations have the same behavior as the generic
implementation, which returns the *next* counter following the final
partial block.  This behavior also has the advantage that if someone
does misuse this case for chaining, then the keystream won't be
repeated.  Thus, this patch makes the tests expect this behavior.
