pwm: Don't use memcmp() to compare state variables

Given that struct pwm_state is sparse (at least on some platforms),
variables of this type might represent the same state because all fields
are pairwise identical but still memcmp() returns a difference because
some of the unused bits are different.

To prevent surprises compare member by member instead of the whole
occupied memory.
