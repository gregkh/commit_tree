kbuild: remove unimportant comments from ./Kbuild

Every time we add/remove a target, we need to touch the header part,
including renumbering. This is not so important information.

Numbering targets is rather misleading because they are not necessarily
generated in this order. For example, 1) and 2) can be executed
simultaneously when the -j option is given.
