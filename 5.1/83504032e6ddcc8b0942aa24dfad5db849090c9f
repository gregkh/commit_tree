arm64: Remove asm/memblock.h

The arm64 asm/memblock.h header exists only to provide a function
prototype for arm64_memblock_init(), which is called only from
setup_arch().

Move the declaration into mmu.h, where it can live alongside other
init functions such as paging_init() and bootmem_init() without the
need for its own special header file.
