serial: sh-sci: Fix fallback to PIO in sci_dma_rx_complete()

When submitting a DMA request fails in sci_dma_rx_complete(), the driver
tries to fall back to PIO, but that does not work: no more data will be
received, or the kernel will even crash.

Fix this similar as in (but not identical to) sci_submit_rx():
  - On SCIF, PIO cannot take over if any DMA transactions are pending,
    hence they must be terminated first.
  - All active cookies must be invalidated, else rx_timer_fn() may
    trigger a NULL pointer dereference.
  - Restarting the port is not needed, as it is already running, but
    serial port interrupts must be directed back from the DMA engine to
    the CPU.
