tools/bpf: move libbpf pr_* debug print functions to headers

A global function libbpf_print, which is invisible
outside the shared library, is defined to print based
on levels. The pr_warning, pr_info and pr_debug
macros are moved into the newly created header
common.h. So any .c file including common.h can
use these macros directly.

Currently btf__new and btf_ext__new API has an argument getting
__pr_debug function pointer into btf.c so the debugging information
can be printed there. This patch removed this parameter
from btf__new and btf_ext__new and directly using pr_debug in btf.c.

Another global function libbpf_print_level_available, also
invisible outside the shared library, can test
whether a particular level debug printing is
available or not. It is used in btf.c to
test whether DEBUG level debug printing is availabl or not,
based on which the log buffer will be allocated when loading
btf to the kernel.
