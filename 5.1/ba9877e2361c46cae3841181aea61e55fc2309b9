drm/bridge: dw-hdmi: add support for YUV420 output

In order to support the HDMI2.0 YUV420 display modes, this patch
adds support for the YUV420 TMDS Clock divided by 2 and the controller
passthrough mode.

YUV420 Synopsys PHY support will need some specific configuration table
to support theses modes.

This patch is based on work from Zheng Yang <zhengyang@rock-chips.com> in
the Rockchip Linux 4.4 BSP at [1]
