sched/pelt: Skip updating util_est when utilization is higher than CPU's capacity

util_est is mainly meant to be a lower-bound for tasks utilization.
That's why task_util_est() returns the actual util_avg when it's higher
than the estimated utilization.

With new invaraince signal and without any special check on samples
collection, if a task is limited because of thermal capping for
example, we could end up overestimating its utilization and thus
perhaps generating an unwanted frequency spike when the capping is
relaxed... and (even worst) it will take some more activations for the
estimated utilization to converge back to the actual utilization.

Since we cannot easily know if there is idle time in a CPU when a task
completes an activation with a utilization higher then the CPU capacity,
we skip the sampling when utilization is higher than CPU's capacity.
