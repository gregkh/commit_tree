drm/i915: Move on the new pm runtime interface

Use the new PM-runtime interface to get the accounted suspended time:
pm_runtime_suspended_time().

This new interface helps to simplify and cleanup the code that computes
__I915_SAMPLE_RC6_ESTIMATED and to remove direct access to internals of
PM-runtime.
