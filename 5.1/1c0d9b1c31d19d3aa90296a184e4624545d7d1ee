ACPI: APEI: Fix possible out-of-bounds access to BERT region

Check that the length recorded in the generic error status block is
within the region before checking the contents of the region itself.

Otherwise it may result in an out-of-bounds access if the system
firmware has generated a status block with an invalid length (larger
than the mapped region). Also move the block_status check so that it
only happens after the block has been verified to be within the mapped
region.
