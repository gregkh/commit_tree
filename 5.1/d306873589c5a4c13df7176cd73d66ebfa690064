ASoC: rt5651: Add ACPI ID 10EC5640

Some BYT platforms have a RT5651 codec while using an ACPI node with
a HID of 10EC5640 to describe the coded. Add the 10EC5640 HID to the
acpi_device_id list, so that the rt5651 will bind to the codec on these
devices.

Like the rt5645 and rt5670 drivers which also have the 10EC5640 ACPI HID
in their acpi_device_id list for similar reasons, the rt5651 driver checks
the codecs device-id register so that it will only bind if the codec
actually is a rt5651 and it will ignore actual rt5640 codecs.
