drm/i915/selftests: Verify we can perform resets from atomic context

We currently require that our per-engine reset can be called from any
context, even hardirq, and in the future wish to perform the device
reset without holding struct_mutex (which requires some lockless
shenanigans that demand the lowlevel intel_reset_gpu() be able to be
used in atomic context). Test that we meet the current requirements by
calling i915_reset_engine() from under various atomic contexts.
