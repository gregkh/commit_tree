perf feature detection: Add -lopcodes to feature-libbfd

Both libbfd and libopcodes are distributed with binutil-dev/devel. When
libbfd is present, it is OK to assume that libopcodes also present. This
has been a safe assumption for bpftool.

This patch adds -lopcodes to perf/Makefile.config. libopcodes will be
used in the next commit for BPF annotation.
