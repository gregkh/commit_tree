selftests/bpf: make sure signal interrupts BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN

Simple test that I used to reproduce the issue in the previous commit:
Do BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN with max iterations, each program is 4096 simple
move instructions. File alarm in 0.1 second and check that
bpf_prog_test_run is interrupted (i.e. test doesn't hang).

Note: reposting this for bpf-next to avoid linux-next conflict. In this
version I test both BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER (which uses generic
bpf_test_run implementation) and BPF_PROG_TYPE_FLOW_DISSECTOR (which has
it own loop with preempt handling in bpf_prog_test_run_flow_dissector).
