drivers/IB,usnic: reduce scope of mmap_sem

usnic_uiom_get_pages() uses gup_longterm() so we cannot really get rid of
mmap_sem altogether in the driver, but we can get rid of some complexity
that mmap_sem brings with only pinned_vm.  We can get rid of the wq
altogether as we no longer need to defer work to unpin pages as the
counter is now atomic. We also share the lock.
