drm/amdgpu/powerplay: add missing breaks in polaris10_smumgr

This was noticed by Gustavo and his -Wimplicit-fallthrough
patches.  However, in this case, I believe we should have breaks
rather than falling though, that said, in practice we should
never fall through in the first place so there should be no
change in behavior.
