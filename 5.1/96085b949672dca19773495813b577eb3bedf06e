KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-v3: Retire pending interrupts on disabling LPIs

When disabling LPIs (for example on reset) at the redistributor
level, it is expected that LPIs that was pending in the CPU
interface are eventually retired.

Currently, this is not what is happening, and these LPIs will
stay in the ap_list, eventually being acknowledged by the vcpu
(which didn't quite expect this behaviour).

The fix is thus to retire these LPIs from the list of pending
interrupts as we disable LPIs.
