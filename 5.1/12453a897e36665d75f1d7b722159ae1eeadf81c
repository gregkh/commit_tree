usb: host: xhci: mvebu: add reset on resume quirk

The mvebu xHCI host driver does not have suspend/resume support. Use of
the XHCI_RESET_ON_RESUME quirk is mandatory in order to avoid failures
after resume. This will work only if no USB device is plugged-in.

While at it, mention in the Kconfig file that this IP is also present
on the A3700 SoC.
