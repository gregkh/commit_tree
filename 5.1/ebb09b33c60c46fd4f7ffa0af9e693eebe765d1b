NTB: add new parameter to peer_db_addr() db_bit and db_data

NTB door bell usage depends on NTB hardware.

ex: intel NTB gen1 has one peer door bell register which can be controlled
by the bitmap writen to it, while Intel NTB gen3 has a registers
per door bell and the data trigering the each door bell is always 1.

therefore exposing only peer door bell address forcing the user
to be aware of such low level details
