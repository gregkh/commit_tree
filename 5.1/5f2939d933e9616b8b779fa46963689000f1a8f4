sch_api: Change signature of qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() to use ints

There are now several places where qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() is called
with a negative number of packets (to signal an increase in number of
packets in the queue). Rather than rely on overflow behaviour, change the
function signature to use signed integers to communicate this usage to
people reading the code.
