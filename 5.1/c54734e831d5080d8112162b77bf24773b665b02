pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7794: Initialize TDSEL register for ES1.0

Documentation for ES1.0 says that some bits in TDSEL must be set (ch
5.3.35 in R-Car E2 v0.5). However, the reset value of the register is 0,
so software has to do it. Add this to the kernel driver to ensure this
is really done independent of firmware versions and use whitelisting for
ES versions known to need this.

This is needed for some SD cards supporting SDR104 transfer mode.
