net: fou: do not use guehdr after iptunnel_pull_offloads in gue_udp_recv

gue tunnels run iptunnel_pull_offloads on received skbs. This can
determine a possible use-after-free accessing guehdr pointer since
the packet will be 'uncloned' running pskb_expand_head if it is a
cloned gso skb (e.g if the packet has been sent though a veth device)
