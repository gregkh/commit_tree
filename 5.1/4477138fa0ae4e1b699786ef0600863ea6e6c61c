tun: properly test for IFF_UP

Same reasons than the ones explained in commit 4179cb5a4c92
("vxlan: test dev->flags & IFF_UP before calling netif_rx()")

netif_rx_ni() or napi_gro_frags() must be called under a strict contract.

At device dismantle phase, core networking clears IFF_UP
and flush_all_backlogs() is called after rcu grace period
to make sure no incoming packet might be in a cpu backlog
and still referencing the device.

A similar protocol is used for gro layer.

Most drivers call netif_rx() from their interrupt handler,
and since the interrupts are disabled at device dismantle,
netif_rx() does not have to check dev->flags & IFF_UP

Virtual drivers do not have this guarantee, and must
therefore make the check themselves.
