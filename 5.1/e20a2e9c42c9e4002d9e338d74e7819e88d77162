Bluetooth: Fix decrementing reference count twice in releasing socket

When releasing socket, it is possible to enter hci_sock_release() and
hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG) at the same time in different thread.
The reference count of hdev should be decremented only once from one of
them but if storing hdev to local variable in hci_sock_release() before
detached from socket and setting to NULL in hci_sock_dev_event(),
hci_dev_put(hdev) is unexpectedly called twice. This is resolved by
referencing hdev from socket after bt_sock_unlink() in
hci_sock_release().
