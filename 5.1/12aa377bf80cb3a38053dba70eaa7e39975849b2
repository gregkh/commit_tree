clk: export some clk_hw function symbols for module drivers

clk-provider.h provides clk_hw_is_prepared(), clk_hw_is_enabled() and
clk_hw_is_prepared() but these symbols are not exported for the
modules which prevents a clock driver using them to be compiled as
a module. Export them to fix the problem.
