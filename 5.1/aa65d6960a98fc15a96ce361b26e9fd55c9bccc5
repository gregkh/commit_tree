bpf: Add state, dst_ip4, dst_ip6 and dst_port to bpf_sock

This patch adds "state", "dst_ip4", "dst_ip6" and "dst_port" to the
bpf_sock.  The userspace has already been using "state",
e.g. inet_diag (ss -t) and getsockopt(TCP_INFO).

This patch also allows narrow load on the following existing fields:
"family", "type", "protocol" and "src_port".  Unlike IP address,
the load offset is resticted to the first byte for them but it
can be relaxed later if there is a use case.

This patch also folds __sock_filter_check_size() into
bpf_sock_is_valid_access() since it is not called
by any where else.  All bpf_sock checking is in
one place.
