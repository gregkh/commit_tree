drm/vc4: Take margin setup into account when updating planes

Applyin margins is just a matter of scaling all planes appropriately
and adjusting the CRTC X/Y offset to account for the
left/right/top/bottom borders.

Create a vc4_plane_margins_adj() function doing that and call it from
vc4_plane_setup_clipping_and_scaling() so that we are ready to attach
margins properties to the HDMI connector.
