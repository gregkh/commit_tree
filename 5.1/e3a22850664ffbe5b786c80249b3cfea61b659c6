deb-pkg: generate correct build dependencies

bison/flex is now needed always for building for kconfig. Some build
dependencies depend on kernel configuration, enable them as needed:

- libelf-dev when UNWINDER_ORC is set
- libssl-dev for SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYRING

Since the libssl-dev is needed for extract_cert binary, denote with
:native to install the libssl-dev for the build machines architecture,
rather than for the architecture of the kernel being built.
