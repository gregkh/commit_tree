net: hns3: remove dcb_ops->map_update in hclge_dcb

After doing down/uninit/init/up in hclge_dcb, it is not necessary
to call dcb_ops->map_update in enet, so hclge_map_update can be
called directly in hclge_dcb.

This is for preparing to call hns3_nic_set_real_num_queue with
netdev down when user changes mqprio configuration.
