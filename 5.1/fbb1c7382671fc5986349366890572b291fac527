drm/rockchip: Separate RK3288 from RK3368 win01 registers

This commit splits the registers for RK3288 from those
for RK3328, RK3368 and RK3399. It seems RK3288 does not
support plane x-y-mirroring, and so in order to support this
for the other SoCs, we need to have separate set of registers
for win0 and win1.
