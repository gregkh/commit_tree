powerpc/traps: fix recoverability of machine check handling on book3s/32

Looks like book3s/32 doesn't set RI on machine check, so
checking RI before calling die() will always be fatal
allthought this is not an issue in most cases.

Fixes: b96672dd840f ("powerpc: Machine check interrupt is a non-maskable interrupt")
Fixes: daf00ae71dad ("powerpc/traps: restore recoverability of machine_check interrupts")
