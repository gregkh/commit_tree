ARM: dts: msm8660: Fix up GIC IRQ flags

All the GSBI blocks are marking their GIC IRQ lines as
"IRQ_TYPE_NONE" but there is no such thing: all GIC IRQ
lines have a trigger type.

That yields the following warning from the GIC driver:

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at ../drivers/irqchip/irq-gic.c:1016
	 gic_irq_domain_translate+0xdc/0xe4
(...)

Mark all of these IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH as is common so this
warning goes away.
