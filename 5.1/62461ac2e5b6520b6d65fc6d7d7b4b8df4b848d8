include/linux/relay.h: fix percpu annotation in struct rchan

The percpu member of this structure is declared as:
	struct ... ** __percpu member;
So its type is:
	__percpu pointer to pointer to struct ...

But looking at how it's used, its type should be:
	pointer to __percpu pointer to struct ...
and it should thus be declared as:
	struct ... * __percpu *member;

So fix the placement of '__percpu' in the definition of this
structures.

This silents a few Sparse's warnings like:
	warning: incorrect type in initializer (different address spaces)
	  expected void const [noderef] <asn:3> *__vpp_verify
	  got struct sched_domain **
