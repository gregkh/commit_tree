habanalabs: allow memory allocations larger than 4GB

This patch increase the size field in the uapi structure of the Memory
IOCTL from 32-bit to 64-bit. This is to allow the user to allocate and/or
map memory in chunks that are larger then 4GB.

Goya's device memory (DRAM) can be up to 16GB, and for certain
topologies, the user may want an allocation that is larger than 4GB.

This change doesn't break current user-space because there was a "pad"
field in the uapi structure right after the size field. Changing the size
field to be 64-bit and removing the pad field maintains compatibility with
current user-space.
