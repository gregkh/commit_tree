ARM: defconfig: Switch LPC18xx to use PL11x DRM driver

None of the LPC18xx device trees contains any display settings,
it just defines a device tree node for the CLCD (PL11x) set
as "disabled" and no panels are attached on any device tree.

This I conclude that the hardware is dormant on existing
systems, so we can without any problems switch the defconfig
over from the old ARMCLCD frame buffer driver to the new
PL11x DRM driver.
