PM-runtime: update accounting_timestamp on enable

Initializing accounting_timestamp to something different from 0 during
pm_runtime_init() doesn't make sense and puts an artificial ordering
constraint between timekeeping_init() and pm_runtime_init().

PM-runtime should start time accounting only when it is enabled and
discard the period when disabled.

Set accounting_timestamp to now when enabling PM-runtime.
