PCI/LINK: Add Kconfig option (default off)

e8303bb7a75c ("PCI/LINK: Report degraded links via link bandwidth
notification") added dmesg logging whenever a link changes speed or width
to a state that is considered degraded.  Unfortunately, it cannot
differentiate signal integrity-related link changes from those
intentionally initiated by an endpoint driver, including drivers that may
live in userspace or VMs when making use of vfio-pci.  Some GPU drivers
actively manage the link state to save power, which generates a stream of
messages like this:

  vfio-pci 0000:07:00.0: 32.000 Gb/s available PCIe bandwidth, limited by 2.5 GT/s x16 link at 0000:00:02.0 (capable of 64.000 Gb/s with 5 GT/s x16 link)

Since we can't distinguish the intentional changes from the signal
integrity issues, leave the reporting turned off by default.  Add a Kconfig
option to turn it on if desired.
