powerpc/64s: Fix HV NMI vs HV interrupt recoverability test

HV interrupts that use HSRR registers do not enter with MSR[RI] clear,
but their entry code is not recoverable vs NMI, due to shared use of
HSPRG1 as a scratch register to save r13.

This means that a system reset or machine check that hits in HSRR
interrupt entry can cause r13 to be silently corrupted.

Fix this by marking NMIs non-recoverable if they land in HV interrupt
ranges.
