ASoC: xlnx: fix error handling in xlnx_formatter_pcm_probe

Currently, if platform_get_irq_byname() fails, the returned error
turns into a huge value, once it is being store into a variable
of type unsigned int, hence never actually reporting any error
and causing unexpected behavior when using the values stored
in aud_drv_data->s2mm_irq and aud_drv_data->mm2s_irq.

Fix this by changing the type of variables s2mm_irq and mm2s_irq in
structure xlnx_pcm_drv_data from unsigned int to int.
