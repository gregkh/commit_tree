gpio: of: Apply regulator-gpio quirk only to enable-gpios

Since commit d6cd33ad7102 ("regulator: gpio: Convert to use descriptors")
the GPIO regulator had inverted the polarity of the control GPIO. This
problem manifested itself on systems with DT containing the following
description (snippet from salvator-common.dtsi):

	gpios = <&gpio5 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	gpios-states = <1>;
	states = <3300000 1
		  1800000 0>;

Prior to the aforementioned commit, the gpio-regulator code used
gpio_request_array() to claim the GPIO(s) specified in the "gpios"
DT node, while the commit changed that to devm_gpiod_get_index().

The legacy gpio_request_array() calls gpio_request_one() and then
gpiod_request(), which parses the DT flags of the "gpios" node and
populates the GPIO descriptor flags field accordingly.

The new devm_gpiod_get_index() calls gpiod_get_index(), then
of_find_gpio(), of_get_named_gpiod_flags() with flags != NULL,
and then of_gpio_flags_quirks(). Since commit a603a2b8d86e
("gpio: of: Add special quirk to parse regulator flags"),
of_gpio_flags_quirks() contains a quirk for regulator-gpio
which was never triggered by the legacy gpio_request_array()
code path, but is triggered by devm_gpiod_get_index() code
path.

This quirk checks whether a GPIO is associated with a fixed
or gpio-regulator and if so, checks two additional conditions.
First, whether such GPIO is active-low, and if so, ignores the
active-low flag. Second, whether the regulator DT node does
have an "enable-active-high" property and if the property is
NOT present, sets the GPIO flags as active-low.

The second check triggers a problem, since it is applied to all
GPIOs associated with a gpio-regulator, rather than only on the
"enable" GPIOs, as the old code did. This changes the way the
gpio-regulator interprets the DT description of the control
GPIOs.

The old code using gpio_request_array() explicitly parsed the
"enable-active-high" DT property and only applied it to the
GPIOs described in the "enable-gpios" DT node, and only if
those were present.

This patch fixes the quirk code by only applying the quirk
to "enable-gpios", thus restoring the old behavior.
