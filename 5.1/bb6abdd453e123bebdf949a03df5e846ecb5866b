scsi: qla2xxx: remove redundant null check on pointer sess

The null check on pointer sess and the subsequent call is redundant as sess
is null on all the the paths that lead to the out_term2 label.  Hence the
null check and the call can be removed.  Also remove the redundant setting
of sess to NULL as this is not required now.
