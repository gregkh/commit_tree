tlv320aic32x4: delay i2c access by 1 ms after hardware reset

As stated in 'TLV320AIC3254 Application Reference Guide' ([1]):

  3.2 Device Startup Lockout Times
    After the TLV320AIC3254 initializes through hardware reset at power-up
    or software reset, the internal registers initialize to default values.
    This initialization takes place within 1ms after pulling the RESET
    signal high. During this initialization phase, no register-read or
    register-write operation should be performed on ADC or DAC coefficient
    buffers. Also, no block within the codec should be powered up during
    the initialization phase.
