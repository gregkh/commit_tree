mlxsw: spectrum: Add struct mlxsw_sp_sb_vals

Spectrum-2 will be configured with a different shared buffer
configuration than Spectrum-1. Therefore introduce a structure for
keeping the chip-specific default and immutable configuration.

Configuration mutable in runtime will still be kept in struct
mlxsw_sp_sb.
