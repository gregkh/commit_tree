io_uring: fix big-endian compat signal mask handling

On big-endian architectures, the signal masks are differnet
between 32-bit and 64-bit tasks, so we have to use a different
function for reading them from user space.

io_cqring_wait() initially got this wrong, and always interprets
this as a native structure. This is ok on x86 and most arm64,
but not on s390, ppc64be, mips64be, sparc64 and parisc.
