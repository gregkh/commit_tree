s390/setup: fix early warning messages

The setup_lowcore() function creates a new prefix page for the boot CPU.
The PSW mask for the system_call, external interrupt, i/o interrupt and
the program check handler have the DAT bit set in this new prefix page.

At the time setup_lowcore is called the system still runs without virtual
address translation, the paging_init() function creates the kernel page
table and loads the CR13 with the kernel ASCE.

Any code between setup_lowcore() and the end of paging_init() that has
a BUG or WARN statement will create a program check that can not be
handled correctly as there is no kernel page table yet.

To allow early WARN statements initially setup the lowcore with DAT off
and set the DAT bit only after paging_init() has completed.
