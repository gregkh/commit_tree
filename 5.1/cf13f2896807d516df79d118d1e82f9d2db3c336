clk: Move of_clk_*() APIs into clk.c from clkdev.c

The API between clk.c and clkdev.c is purely getting the clk_hw
structure (or the struct clk if it's not CCF) and then turning that
struct clk_hw pointer into a struct clk pointer via clk_hw_create_clk().
There's no need to complicate clkdev.c with these DT parsing details
that are only relevant to the common clk framework. Move the DT parsing
logic into the core framework and just expose the APIs to get a clk_hw
pointer and convert it.
