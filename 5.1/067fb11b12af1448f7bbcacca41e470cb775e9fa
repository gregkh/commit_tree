SUNRPC: Remove rpc_xprt::tsh_size

tsh_size was added to accommodate transports that send a pre-amble
before each RPC message. However, this assumes the pre-amble is
fixed in size, which isn't true for some transports. That makes
tsh_size not very generic.

Also I'd like to make the estimation of RPC send and receive
buffer sizes more precise. tsh_size doesn't currently appear to be
accounted for at all by call_allocate.

Therefore let's just remove the tsh_size concept, and make the only
transports that have a non-zero tsh_size employ a direct approach.
