KVM: arm/arm64: Enforce PTE mappings at stage2 when needed

commit 6794ad5443a2118 ("KVM: arm/arm64: Fix unintended stage 2 PMD mappings")
made the checks to skip huge mappings, stricter. However it introduced
a bug where we still use huge mappings, ignoring the flag to
use PTE mappings, by not reseting the vma_pagesize to PAGE_SIZE.

Also, the checks do not cover the PUD huge pages, that was
under review during the same period. This patch fixes both
the issues.
