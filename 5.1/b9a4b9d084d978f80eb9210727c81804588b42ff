arm64: debug: Don't propagate UNKNOWN FAR into si_code for debug signals

FAR_EL1 is UNKNOWN for all debug exceptions other than those caused by
taking a hardware watchpoint. Unfortunately, if a debug handler returns
a non-zero value, then we will propagate the UNKNOWN FAR value to
userspace via the si_addr field of the SIGTRAP siginfo_t.

Instead, let's set si_addr to take on the PC of the faulting instruction,
which we have available in the current pt_regs.
