arm64: tegra: Add nodes for TCU on Tegra194

Add nodes required for communication through the Tegra Combined UART.
This includes the AON HSP instance, addition of shared interrupts
for the TOP0 HSP instance, and finally the TCU node itself. Also
mark the HSP instances as compatible to tegra194-hsp, as the hardware
is not identical but is compatible to tegra186-hsp.
