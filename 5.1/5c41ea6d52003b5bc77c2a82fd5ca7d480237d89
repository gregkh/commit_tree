mmc: sdhci-omap: Don't finish_mrq() on a command error during tuning

commit 5b0d62108b46 ("mmc: sdhci-omap: Add platform specific reset
callback") skips data resets during tuning operation. Because of this,
a data error or data finish interrupt might still arrive after a command
error has been handled and the mrq ended. This ends up with a "mmc0: Got
data interrupt 0x00000002 even though no data operation was in progress"
error message.

Fix this by adding a platform specific callback for sdhci_irq. Mark the
mrq as a failure but wait for a data interrupt instead of calling
finish_mrq().
