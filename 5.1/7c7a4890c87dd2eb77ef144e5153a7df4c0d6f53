selftests/bpf: add btf_dedup test of FWD/STRUCT resolution

This patch adds a btf_dedup test exercising logic of STRUCT<->FWD
resolution and validating that STRUCT is not resolved to a FWD. It also
forces hash collisions, forcing both FWD and STRUCT to be candidates for
each other. Previously this condition caused infinite loop due to FWD
pointing to STRUCT and STRUCT pointing to its FWD.
