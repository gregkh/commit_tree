platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Handle CFL regmap properly

Only Coffeelake should use Cannonlake regmap other than Cannonlake
platform. This allows Coffeelake special handling only when there is no
matching PCI device and default reg map selected as per CPUID is for
Sunrisepoint PCH. This change is needed to enable support for newer SoCs
such as Icelake.
