powerpc: regain entire stack space

thread_info is not anymore in the stack, so the entire stack
can now be used.

There is also no risk anymore of corrupting task_cpu(p) with a
stack overflow so the patch removes the test.

When doing this, an explicit test for NULL stack pointer is
needed in validate_sp() as it is not anymore implicitely covered
by the sizeof(thread_info) gap.

In the meantime, with the previous patch all pointers to the stacks
are not anymore pointers to thread_info so this patch changes them
to void*
