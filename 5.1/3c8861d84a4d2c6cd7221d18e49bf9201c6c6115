drm: Add color management LUT validation helper (v4)

Some hardware may place additional restrictions on the gamma/degamma
curves described by our LUT properties.  E.g., that a gamma curve never
decreases or that the red/green/blue channels of a LUT's entries must be
equal.  Let's add a helper function that drivers can use to test that a
userspace-provided LUT is valid and doesn't violate hardware
requirements.

v2:
 - Combine into a single helper that just takes a bitmask of the tests
   to apply.  (Brian Starkey)
 - Add additional check (always performed) that LUT property blob size
   is always a multiple of the LUT entry size.  (stolen from ARM driver)

v3:
 - Drop the LUT size check again since
   drm_atomic_replace_property_blob_from_id() already covers this for
   us.  (Alexandru Gheorghe)

v4:
 - Use an enum to describe possible test values rather than #define's;
   this is cleaner to provide kerneldoc for.  (Daniel Vetter)
 - s/DRM_COLOR_LUT_INCREASING/DRM_COLOR_LUT_NON_DECREASING/.  (Ville)
