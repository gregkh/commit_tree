media: imx: prpencvf: Stop upstream before disabling IDMA channel

Upstream must be stopped immediately after receiving the last EOF and
before disabling the IDMA channel. This can be accomplished by moving
upstream stream off to just after receiving the last EOF completion in
prp_stop(). For symmetry also move upstream stream on to end of
prp_start().

This fixes a complete system hard lockup on the SabreAuto when streaming
from the ADV7180, by repeatedly sending a stream off immediately followed
by stream on:

while true; do v4l2-ctl  -d1 --stream-mmap --stream-count=3; done

Eventually this either causes the system lockup or EOF timeouts at all
subsequent stream on, until a system reset.

The lockup occurs when disabling the IDMA channel at stream off. Stopping
the video data stream entering the IDMA channel before disabling the
channel itself appears to be a reliable fix for the hard lockup.
