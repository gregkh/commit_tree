habanalabs: don't print result when rc indicates error

send_cpu_message() doesn't update the result parameter when an error
occurs in its code. Therefore, callers of send_cpu_message() shouldn't use
the result value when the return code indicates error.

This patch fixes a static checker warning in goya_test_cpu_queue(), where
that function did print the result even though the return code from
send_cpu_message() indicated error.
