arm64: mm: Ensure tail of unaligned initrd is reserved

In the event that the start address of the initrd is not aligned, but
has an aligned size, the base + size will not cover the entire initrd
image and there is a chance that the kernel will corrupt the tail of the
image.

By aligning the end of the initrd to a page boundary and then
subtracting the adjusted start address the memblock reservation will
cover all pages that contains the initrd.
