vfio/type1: Limit DMA mappings per container

Memory backed DMA mappings are accounted against a user's locked
memory limit, including multiple mappings of the same memory.  This
accounting bounds the number of such mappings that a user can create.
However, DMA mappings that are not backed by memory, such as DMA
mappings of device MMIO via mmaps, do not make use of page pinning
and therefore do not count against the user's locked memory limit.
These mappings still consume memory, but the memory is not well
associated to the process for the purpose of oom killing a task.

To add bounding on this use case, we introduce a limit to the total
number of concurrent DMA mappings that a user is allowed to create.
This limit is exposed as a tunable module option where the default
value of 64K is expected to be well in excess of any reasonable use
case (a large virtual machine configuration would typically only make
use of tens of concurrent mappings).

This fixes CVE-2019-3882.
