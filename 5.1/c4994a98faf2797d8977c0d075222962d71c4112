dmaengine: k3dma: Add support for dma-channel-mask

Add dma-channel-mask as a property for k3dma, it defines
available dma channels which a non-secure mode driver can use.

One sample usage of this is in Hi3660 SoC. DMA channel 0 is
reserved to lpm3, which is a coprocessor for power management. So
as a result, any request in kernel (which runs on main processor
and in non-secure mode) should start from at least channel 1.
