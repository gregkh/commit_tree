drm/amd/display: add way to determine if link is active

[Why]
Need to understand whether link is active aside from stream state.
This could be used to check what links are enabled by GOP.

[How]
Store link_active state in link status and initialize it by checking
if the DIG is enabled.
Keep it updated on every link enable and disable
