drm/i915/skl: Rework MOCS tables to keep common part in a define

The MOCS tables are going to be very similar across platforms.

To reduce the amount of copied code, this patch rips the common part and
puts it into a definition valid for all gen9 platforms.

v2: Made defines for or-ing flags. Renamed macros from MOCS_TABLE
    to MOCS_ENTRIES. (Joonas)
v3 (Lucas):
  - Fix indentation
  - Rebase on rework done by additional patch
  - Remove define for or-ing flags as it made the table more complex by
    requiring zeroed values to be passed
  - Do not embed comma in the macro, so to treat that just as another
    item and please source code formatting tools
