MIPS: mm: Avoid HTW stop/start when dropping an inactive mm

If drop_mmu_context() is called with an mm that is not currently active
on the local CPU then there's no need for us to stop & start a hardware
page table walker because it can't be fetching entries for the ASID
corresponding to the mm we're operating on.

Move the htw_stop() & htw_start() calls into the block which we run only
if the mm is currently active, in order to avoid the redundant work.
