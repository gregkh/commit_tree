dmaengine: k3dma: Upgrade k3dma driver to support hisi_asp_dma hardware

On the hi3660 hardware there are two (at least) DMA controllers,
the DMA-P (Peripheral DMA) and the DMA-A (Audio DMA). The
two blocks are similar, but have some slight differences. This
resulted in the vendor implementing two separate drivers, which
after review, they have been able to condense and re-use the
existing k3dma driver.

Thus, this patch adds support for the new "hisi-pcm-asp-dma-1.0"
compatible string in the binding.

One difference with the DMA-A controller, is that it does not
need to initialize a clock. So we skip this by adding and using
soc data flags.

After above this driver will support both k3 and hisi_asp dma
hardware.
