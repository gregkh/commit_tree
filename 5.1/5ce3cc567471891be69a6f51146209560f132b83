spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Provide support for DSPI slave mode operation (Vybryd vf610)

The NXP's Vybryd vf610 can work as a SPI slave device (the CS and clock
signals are provided by master).

It is possible to specify a single device to work in that mode. As we do
use DMA for transferring data, the RX channel must be prepared for
incoming data.
Moreover, in slave mode we just set a subset of control fields in
configuration registers (CTAR0, PUSHR).

For testing the spidev_test program has been used.
Test script for this patch can be found here:
