xfs: Zero initialize highstale and lowstale in xfs_dir2_leafn_add

When building with -Wsometimes-uninitialized, Clang warns:

fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_dir2_node.c:481:6: warning: variable 'lowstale' is
used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is false
[-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_dir2_node.c:481:6: warning: variable 'highstale' is
used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is false
[-Wsometimes-uninitialized]

While it isn't technically wrong, it isn't a problem in practice because
highstale and lowstale are only initialized in xfs_dir2_leafn_add when
compact is not zero then they are passed to xfs_dir3_leaf_find_entry,
where they are initialized before use when compact is zero. Regardless,
it's better not to be passing around uninitialized stack memory so zero
initialize these variables, which silences this warning.
