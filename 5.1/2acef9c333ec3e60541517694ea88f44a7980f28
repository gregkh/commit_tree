drm/imx: imx-tve: depend on COMMON_CLK

Since the TVE provides a clock to the DI, the driver can only be
compiled if the common clock framework is enabled. With the COMMON_CLK
dependency in place, it will be possible to allow building the other
parts of imx-drm under COMPILE_TEST on architectures that do not select
the common clock framework.
