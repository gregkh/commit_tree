PM / wakeup: Rework wakeup source timer cancellation

If wakeup_source_add() is called right after wakeup_source_remove()
for the same wakeup source, timer_setup() may be called for a
potentially scheduled timer which is incorrect.

To avoid that, move the wakeup source timer cancellation from
wakeup_source_drop() to wakeup_source_remove().

Moreover, make wakeup_source_remove() clear the timer function after
canceling the timer to let wakeup_source_not_registered() treat
unregistered wakeup sources in the same way as the ones that have
never been registered.
