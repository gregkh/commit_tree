xsk: fix to reject invalid options in Tx descriptor

Passing a non-existing option in the options member of struct
xdp_desc was, incorrectly, silently ignored. This patch addresses
that behavior, and drops any Tx descriptor with non-existing options.

We have examined existing user space code, and to our best knowledge,
no one is relying on the current incorrect behavior. AF_XDP is still
in its infancy, so from our perspective, the risk of breakage is very
low, and addressing this problem now is important.
