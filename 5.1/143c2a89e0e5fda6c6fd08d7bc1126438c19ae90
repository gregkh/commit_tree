ARM: 8839/1: kprobe: make patch_lock a raw_spinlock_t

When running kprobe on -rt kernel, the below bug is caught:

|BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/rtmutex.c:931
|in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 128, pid: 14, name: migration/0
|Preemption disabled at:[<802f2b98>] cpu_stopper_thread+0xc0/0x140
|CPU: 0 PID: 14 Comm: migration/0 Tainted: G O 4.8.3-rt2 #1
|Hardware name: Freescale LS1021A
|[<8025a43c>] (___might_sleep)
|[<80b5b324>] (rt_spin_lock)
|[<80b5c31c>] (__patch_text_real)
|[<80b5c3ac>] (patch_text_stop_machine)
|[<802f2920>] (multi_cpu_stop)

Since patch_text_stop_machine() is called in stop_machine() which
disables IRQ, sleepable lock should be not used in this atomic context,
 so replace patch_lock to raw lock.
