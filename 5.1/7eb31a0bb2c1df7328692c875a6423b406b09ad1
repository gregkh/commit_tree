drm/i915: Split the gamma/csc enable bits from the plane_ctl() function

On g4x+ the pipe gamma enable bit for the primary plane affects
the pipe bottom color as well. The same for the pipe csc enable
bit on ilk+. Thus we must configure those bits correctly even
when the primary plane is disabled.

To make the feasible let's split those settings from the
plane_ctl() function into a seprate funciton that we can
call from the ->disable_plane() hook as well.

For consistency we'll do that on all the plane types. While
that has no real benefits at this time, it'll become useful
when we start to control the pipe gamma/csc enable bits
dynamically when we overhaul the color management code.

On pre-g4x there doesn't appear to be any way to gamma
correct the pipe bottom color, but sticking to the same
pattern doesn't hurt. And it'll still help us to do
crtc state readout correctly for the pipe gamma enable
bit for the color management overhaul.

An alternative apporach would be to still precompute these
bits into plane_state->ctl, but that would require that we
run through the plane check even when the plane isn't logically
enabled on any crtc. Currently that condition causes us to
short circuit the entire thing and not call ->check_plane().
There would also be some chicken and egg problems with
->check_plane() vs. crtc color state check that would
requite splitting certain things into multiple steps.
So all in all this seems like the easier route.
