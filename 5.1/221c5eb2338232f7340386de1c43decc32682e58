io_uring: add support for IORING_OP_POLL

This is basically a direct port of bfe4037e722e, which implements a
one-shot poll command through aio. Description below is based on that
commit as well. However, instead of adding a POLL command and relying
on io_cancel(2) to remove it, we mimic the epoll(2) interface of
having a command to add a poll notification, IORING_OP_POLL_ADD,
and one to remove it again, IORING_OP_POLL_REMOVE.

To poll for a file descriptor the application should submit an sqe of
type IORING_OP_POLL. It will poll the fd for the events specified in the
poll_events field.

Unlike poll or epoll without EPOLLONESHOT this interface always works in
one shot mode, that is once the sqe is completed, it will have to be
resubmitted.
