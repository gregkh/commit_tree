svcrpc: fix UDP on servers with lots of threads

James Pearson found that an NFS server stopped responding to UDP
requests if started with more than 1017 threads.

sv_max_mesg is about 2^20, so that is probably where the calculation
performed by

	svc_sock_setbufsize(svsk->sk_sock,
                            (serv->sv_nrthreads+3) * serv->sv_max_mesg,
                            (serv->sv_nrthreads+3) * serv->sv_max_mesg);

starts to overflow an int.
