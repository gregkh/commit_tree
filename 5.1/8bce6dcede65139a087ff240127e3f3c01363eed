staging: erofs: fix to handle error path of erofs_vmap()

erofs_vmap() wrapped vmap() and vm_map_ram() to return virtual
continuous memory, but both of them can failed due to a lot of
reason, previously, erofs_vmap()'s callers didn't handle them,
which can potentially cause NULL pointer access, fix it.
