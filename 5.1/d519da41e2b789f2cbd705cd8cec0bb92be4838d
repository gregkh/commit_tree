xfs: Introduce XFS_PTAG_VERIFIER_ERROR panic mask

Currently we have a few PTAGs in place allowing us to transform a filesystem
error in a BUG() call.  However, we don't have a panic tag for corrupt
metadata, so introduce XFS_PTAG_VERIFIER_ERROR so that the administrator can
use the fs.xfs.panic_mask sysctl knob to convert any error detected by buffer
verifiers into a kernel panic.
