staging: iio: adt7316: fix the dac write calculation

The lsb calculation is not masking the correct bits from the user input.
Subtract 1 from (1 << offset) to correctly set up the mask to be applied
to user input.

The lsb register stores its value starting at the bit 7 position.
adt7316_store_DAC() currently assumes the value is at the other end of the
register. Shift the lsb value before storing it in a new variable lsb_reg,
and write this variable to the lsb register.
