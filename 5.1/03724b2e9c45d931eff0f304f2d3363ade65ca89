perf record: Allow to limit number of reported perf.data files

When doing long term recording and waiting for some event to snapshot
on, we often only care about the last minute or so.

The --switch-output command line option supports rotating the perf.data
file when the size exceeds a threshold. But the disk would still be
filled with unnecessary old files.

Add a new option to only keep a number of rotated files, so that the
disk space usage can be limited.
