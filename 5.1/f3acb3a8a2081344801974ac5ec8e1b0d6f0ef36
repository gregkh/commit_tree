perf machine: Use cached rbtrees

At the cost of an extra pointer, we can avoid the O(logN) cost of
finding the first element in the tree (smallest node), which is
something required for nearly every operation dealing with
machine->guests and threads->entries.

The conversion is straightforward, however, it's worth noticing that the
rb_erase_init() calls have been replaced by rb_erase_cached() which has
no _init() flavor, however, the node is explicitly cleared next anyway,
which was redundant until now.
