mm/hotplug: treat CMA pages as unmovable

has_unmovable_pages() is used by allocating CMA and gigantic pages as
well as the memory hotplug.  The later doesn't know how to offline CMA
pool properly now, but if an unused (free) CMA page is encountered, then
has_unmovable_pages() happily considers it as a free memory and
propagates this up the call chain.  Memory offlining code then frees the
page without a proper CMA tear down which leads to an accounting issues.
Moreover if the same memory range is onlined again then the memory never
gets back to the CMA pool.

State after memory offline:

 # grep cma /proc/vmstat
 nr_free_cma 205824

 # cat /sys/kernel/debug/cma/cma-kvm_cma/count
 209920

Also, kmemleak still think those memory address are reserved below but
have already been used by the buddy allocator after onlining.  This
patch fixes the situation by treating CMA pageblocks as unmovable except
when has_unmovable_pages() is called as part of CMA allocation.
