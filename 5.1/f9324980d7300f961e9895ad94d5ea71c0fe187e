lightnvm: pblk: stop taking the free lock in in pblk_lines_free

pblk_line_meta_free might sleep (it can end up calling vfree, depending
on how we allocate lba lists), and this can lead to a BUG()
if we wake up on a different cpu and release the lock.

As there is no point of grabbing the free lock when pblk has shut down,
remove the lock.
