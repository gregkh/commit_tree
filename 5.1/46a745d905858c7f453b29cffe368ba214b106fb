sched/fair: Fix unnecessary increase of balance interval

In case of active balancing, we increase the balance interval to cover
pinned tasks cases not covered by all_pinned logic. Neverthless, the
active migration triggered by asym packing should be treated as the normal
unbalanced case and reset the interval to default value, otherwise active
migration for asym_packing can be easily delayed for hundreds of ms
because of this pinned task detection mechanism.

The same happens to other conditions tested in need_active_balance() like
misfit task and when the capacity of src_cpu is reduced compared to
dst_cpu (see comments in need_active_balance() for details).
