tee: optee: Initialize some structs using memset instead of braces

Clang warns:

drivers/tee/optee/device.c:39:31: warning: suggest braces around
initialization of subobject [-Wmissing-braces]
        struct tee_param param[4] = {0};

One way to fix these warnings is to add additional braces like Clang
suggests; however, there has been a bit of push back from some
maintainers, who just prefer memset as it is unambiguous, doesn't
depend on a particular compiler version, and properly initializes all
subobjects [1][2]. Do that here so there are no more warnings.
