scsi: bfa: bfa_fcs_rport: Mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases where
we are expecting to fall through.

Notice that I replaced "!! fall through !!" and "!!! fall through !!!"
comments with "fall through" annotations, which is what GCC is expecting to
find.
