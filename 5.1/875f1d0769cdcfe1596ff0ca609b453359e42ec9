iov_iter: add ITER_BVEC_FLAG_NO_REF flag

For ITER_BVEC, if we're holding on to kernel pages, the caller
doesn't need to grab a reference to the bvec pages, and drop that
same reference on IO completion. This is essentially safe for any
ITER_BVEC, but some use cases end up reusing pages and uncondtionally
dropping a page reference on completion. And example of that is
sendfile(2), that ends up being a splice_in + splice_out on the
pipe pages.

Add a flag that tells us it's fine to not grab a page reference
to the bvec pages, since that caller knows not to drop a reference
when it's done with the pages.
