bpf: notify offload JITs about optimizations

Let offload JITs know when instructions are replaced and optimized
out, so they can update their state appropriately.  The optimizations
are best effort, if JIT returns an error from any callback verifier
will stop notifying it as state may now be out of sync, but the
verifier continues making progress.
