net: phy: marvell: Fix buffer overrun with stats counters

marvell_get_sset_count() returns how many statistics counters there
are. If the PHY supports fibre, there are 3, otherwise two.

marvell_get_strings() does not make this distinction, and always
returns 3 strings. This then often results in writing past the end
of the buffer for the strings.
