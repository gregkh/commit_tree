fix cgroup_do_mount() handling of failure exits

same story as with last May fixes in sysfs (7b745a4e4051
"unfuck sysfs_mount()"); new_sb is left uninitialized
in case of early errors in kernfs_mount_ns() and papering
over it by treating any error from kernfs_mount_ns() as
equivalent to !new_ns ends up conflating the cases when
objects had never been transferred to a superblock with
ones when that has happened and resulting new superblock
had been dropped.  Easily fixed (same way as in sysfs
case).  Additionally, there's a superblock leak on
kernfs_node_dentry() failure *and* a dentry leak inside
kernfs_node_dentry() itself - the latter on probably
impossible errors, but the former not impossible to trigger
(as the matter of fact, injecting allocation failures
at that point *does* trigger it).
