ACPI: debug: Clean up acpi_aml_init()

The err_exit label in acpi_aml_init() is not used any more after
commit 9ec6dbfbdc0a ("ACPI: no need to check return value of
debugfs_create functions"), but the other label in there is not
necessary too, so rearrange the code to get rid of them both.

No intentional functional impact.
