tcp: Don't access TCP_SKB_CB before initializing it

Since commit eeea10b83a13 ("tcp: add
tcp_v4_fill_cb()/tcp_v4_restore_cb()"), tcp_vX_fill_cb is only called
after tcp_filter(). That means, TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->end_seq still points to
the IP-part of the cb.

We thus should not mock with it, as this can trigger bugs (thanks
syzkaller):

Setting end_seq is actually no more necessary in tcp_filter as it gets
initialized later on in tcp_vX_fill_cb.
