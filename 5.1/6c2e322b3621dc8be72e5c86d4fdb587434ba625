crypto: cfb - remove bogus memcpy() with src == dest

The memcpy() in crypto_cfb_decrypt_inplace() uses walk->iv as both the
source and destination, which has undefined behavior.  It is unneeded
because walk->iv is already used to hold the previous ciphertext block;
thus, walk->iv is already updated to its final value.  So, remove it.

Also, note that in-place decryption is the only case where the previous
ciphertext block is not directly available.  Therefore, as a related
cleanup I also updated crypto_cfb_encrypt_segment() to directly use the
previous ciphertext block rather than save it into walk->iv.  This makes
it consistent with in-place encryption and out-of-place decryption; now
only in-place decryption is different, because it has to be.
