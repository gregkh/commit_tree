crypto: arm64/crct10dif-ce - cleanup and optimizations

The x86, arm, and arm64 asm implementations of crct10dif are very
difficult to understand partly because many of the comments, labels, and
macros are named incorrectly: the lengths mentioned are usually off by a
factor of two from the actual code.  Many other things are unnecessarily
convoluted as well, e.g. there are many more fold constants than
actually needed and some aren't fully reduced.

This series therefore cleans up all these implementations to be much
more maintainable.  I also made some small optimizations where I saw
opportunities, resulting in slightly better performance.

This patch cleans up the arm64 version.
