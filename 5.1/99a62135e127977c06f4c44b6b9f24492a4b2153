sctp: use SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC and add SCTP_CURRENT_ASSOC for SCTP_ENABLE_STREAM_RESET sockopt

Check with SCTP_ALL_ASSOC instead in sctp_setsockopt_enable_strreset and
check with SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC instead in sctp_getsockopt_enable_strreset,
it's compatible with 0.

SCTP_CURRENT_ASSOC is supported for SCTP_ENABLE_STREAM_RESET in this patch.
It also adjusts some code to keep a same check form as other functions.
