ALSA: fireface: add support for Fireface UCX

Fireface UFX was shipped by RME GmbH in 2012. This model supports later
protocol for management of isochronous communication and synchronization
of sampling transmission frequency.

This commit adds support for the model. At present, it's not clear how
to encode MIDI messages and decide destination address for asynchronous
transaction, thus this commit adds support for isochronous communication
for PCM frames only.
