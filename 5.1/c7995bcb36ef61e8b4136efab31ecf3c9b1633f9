bus: imx-weim: guard against timing configuration conflicts

When specifying weim child devices, there is a risk that more than
one timing setting is specified for the same chip select.

The driver cannot support such a configuration.

In case of conflict, this patch will print a warning to the log,
and will ignore the child node in question.

In this example, node acme@1 will be ignored, as it tries to modify
timing settings for CS0:

&weim {
	acme@0 {
		compatible = "acme,whatever";
		reg = <0 0 0x100>;
		fsl,weim-cs-timing = <something>;
	};
	acme@1 {
		compatible = "acme,whatnot";
		reg = <0 0x500 0x100>;
		fsl,weim-cs-timing = <something else>;
	};
};

However in this example, the driver will be happy:

&weim {
        acme@0 {
                compatible = "acme,whatever";
                reg = <0 0 0x100>;
                fsl,weim-cs-timing = <something>;
        };
        acme@1 {
                compatible = "acme,whatnot";
                reg = <0 0x500 0x100>;
                fsl,weim-cs-timing = <something>;
        };
};
