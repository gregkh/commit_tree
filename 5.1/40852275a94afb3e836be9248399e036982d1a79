LSM: add SafeSetID module that gates setid calls

This change ensures that the set*uid family of syscalls in kernel/sys.c
(setreuid, setuid, setresuid, setfsuid) all call ns_capable_common with
the CAP_OPT_INSETID flag, so capability checks in the security_capable
hook can know whether they are being called from within a set*uid
syscall. This change is a no-op by itself, but is needed for the
proposed SafeSetID LSM.
