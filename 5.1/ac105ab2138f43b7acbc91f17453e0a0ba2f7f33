media: i2c: adv748x: Convert SW reset routine to function

The ADV748x is currently reset by writting a small table of registers to
the device.

The table lacks documentation and contains magic values to perform the
actions, including using a fake register address to introduce a delay
loop.

Remove the table, and convert to code, documenting the purpose of the
specific writes along the way.
