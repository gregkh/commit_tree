net: bridge: multicast: use rcu to access port list from br_multicast_start_querier

br_multicast_start_querier() walks over the port list but it can be
called from a timer with only multicast_lock held which doesn't protect
the port list, so use RCU to walk over it.

Fixes: c83b8fab06fc ("bridge: Restart queries when last querier expires")
