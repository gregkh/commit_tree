KVM: VMX: Pass "launched" directly to the vCPU-run asm blob

...and remove struct vcpu_vmx's temporary __launched variable.

Eliminating __launched is a bonus, the real motivation is to get to the
point where the only reference to struct vcpu_vmx in the asm code is
to vcpu.arch.regs, which will simplify moving the blob to a proper asm
file.  Note that also means this approach is deliberately different than
what is used in nested_vmx_check_vmentry_hw().

Use BL as it is a callee-save register in both 32-bit and 64-bit ABIs,
i.e. it can't be modified by vmx_update_host_rsp(), to avoid having to
temporarily save/restore the launched flag.
