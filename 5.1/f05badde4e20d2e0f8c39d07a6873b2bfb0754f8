RISC-V: Fix Maximum Physical Memory 2GiB option for 64bit systems

The Maximum Physical Memory 2GiB option for 64bit systems is currently
broken because kernel hangs at boot-time when this option is enabled
and the underlying system has more than 2GiB memory.

This issue can be easily reproduced on SiFive Unleashed board where
we have 8GiB of memory.

This patch fixes above issue by removing unusable memory region in
setup_bootmem().
