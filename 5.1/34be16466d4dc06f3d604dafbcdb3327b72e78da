tools lib bpf: Introduce bpf_program__get_prog_info_linear()

Currently, bpf_prog_info includes 9 arrays. The user has the option to
fetch any combination of these arrays. However, this requires a lot of
handling.

This work becomes more tricky when we need to store bpf_prog_info to a
file, because these arrays are allocated independently.

This patch introduces 'struct bpf_prog_info_linear', which stores arrays
of bpf_prog_info in continuous memory.

Helper functions are introduced to unify the work to get different sets
of bpf_prog_info.  Specifically, bpf_program__get_prog_info_linear()
allows the user to select which arrays to fetch, and handles details for
the user.

Please see the comments right before 'enum bpf_prog_info_array' for more
details and examples.
