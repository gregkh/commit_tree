x86: make ZERO_PAGE() at least parse its argument

This doesn't really do anything, but at least we now parse teh
ZERO_PAGE() address argument so that we'll catch the most obvious errors
in usage next time they'll happen.

See commit 6a5c5d26c4c6 ("rdma: fix build errors on s390 and MIPS due to
bad ZERO_PAGE use") what happens when we don't have any use of the macro
argument at all.
