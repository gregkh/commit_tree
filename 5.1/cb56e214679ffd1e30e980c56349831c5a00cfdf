mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Include delta bits into hashtable key

Currently only ERP mask masked bits in key are considered for
the hashtable key. That leads to false negative collisions
and fallbacks to C-TCAM in case two keys differ only in delta bits.

Fix this by taking full encoded key as a hashtable key,
including delta bits.
