bpf: make LWTUNNEL_BPF dependent on INET

Lightweight tunnels are L3 constructs that are used with IP/IP6.

For example, lwtunnel_xmit is called from ip_output.c and
ip6_output.c only.

Make the dependency explicit at least for LWT-BPF, as now they
call into IP routing.

V2: added "Reported-by" below.
