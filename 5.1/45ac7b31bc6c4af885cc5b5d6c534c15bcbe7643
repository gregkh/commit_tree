staging: speakup_soft: Fix alternate speech with other synths

When switching from speakup_soft to another synth, speakup_soft would
keep calling synth_buffer_getc() from softsynthx_read.

Let's thus make synth.c export the knowledge of the current synth, so
that speakup_soft can determine whether it should be running.

speakup_soft also needs to set itself alive, otherwise the switch would
let it remain silent.
