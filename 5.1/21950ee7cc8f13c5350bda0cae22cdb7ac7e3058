drm/i915: Pull i915_gem_active into the i915_active family

Looking forward, we need to break the struct_mutex dependency on
i915_gem_active. In the meantime, external use of i915_gem_active is
quite beguiling, little do new users suspect that it implies a barrier
as each request it tracks must be ordered wrt the previous one. As one
of many, it can be used to track activity across multiple timelines, a
shared fence, which fits our unordered request submission much better. We
need to steer external users away from the singular, exclusive fence
imposed by i915_gem_active to i915_active instead. As part of that
process, we move i915_gem_active out of i915_request.c into
i915_active.c to start separating the two concepts, and rename it to
i915_active_request (both to tie it to the concept of tracking just one
request, and to give it a longer, less appealing name).
