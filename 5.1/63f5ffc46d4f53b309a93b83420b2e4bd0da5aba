spi: sprd: Fix the error data length in SPI read-only mode

In SPI read-only mode, we will always return the writing length,
which is always the power of "bits_per_word", but the length unit
using by users is byte.

Thus this patch fixes the returning length by getting from
read_bufs() function to get the correct length.
