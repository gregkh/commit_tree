HID: quirks: Fix keyboard + touchpad on Lenovo Miix 630

Similar to commit edfc3722cfef ("HID: quirks: Fix keyboard + touchpad on
Toshiba Click Mini not working"), the Lenovo Miix 630 has a combo
keyboard/touchpad device with vid:pid of 04F3:0400, which is shared with
Elan touchpads.  The combo on the Miix 630 has an ACPI id of QTEC0001,
which is not claimed by the elan_i2c driver, so key on that similar to
what was done for the Toshiba Click Mini.
