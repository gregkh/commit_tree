iwlwifi: remove redundant condition from prior alive dump flow

After the FW image was loaded for the first time,
fwrt->smem_cfg.num_lmacs value will no longer be zero since we don't
clean it when we stop the device. So if we load the image once and then
we fail on a consecutive attempt, the driver will abort any dumping.

Solve this by removing the condition. It is safe to remove since
when we do the actual dumping in iwl_fw_dbg_collect_sync we check
that STATUS_DEVICE_ENABLED bit is still active.
