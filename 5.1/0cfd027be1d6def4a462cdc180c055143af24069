vfio_pci: Enable memory accesses before calling pci_map_rom

pci_map_rom/pci_get_rom_size() performs memory access in the ROM.
In case the Memory Space accesses were disabled, readw() is likely
to trigger a synchronous external abort on some platforms.

In case memory accesses were disabled, re-enable them before the
call and disable them back again just after.
