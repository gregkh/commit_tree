sysrq: Restore original console_loglevel when sysrq disabled

The sysrq header line is printed with an increased loglevel
to provide users some positive feedback.

The original loglevel is not restored when the sysrq operation
is disabled. This bug was introduced in 2.6.12 (pre-git-history)
by the commit ("Allow admin to enable only some of the Magic-Sysrq
functions").
