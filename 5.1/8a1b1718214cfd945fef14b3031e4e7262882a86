perf build: Check what binutils's 'disassembler()' signature to use

Commit 003ca0fd2286 ("Refactor disassembler selection") in the binutils
repo, which changed the disassembler() function signature, so we must
use the feature test introduced in fb982666e380 ("tools/bpftool: fix
bpftool build with bintutils >= 2.9") to deal with that.

Committer testing:

After adding the missing function call to test-all.c, and:

  FEATURE_CHECK_LDFLAGS-disassembler-four-args = -bfd -lopcodes

And the fallbacks for cases where we need -liberty and sometimes -lz to
tools/perf/Makefile.config, we get:

  $ make -C tools/perf O=/tmp/build/perf install-bin
  make: Entering directory '/home/acme/git/perf/tools/perf'
    BUILD:   Doing 'make -j8' parallel build

The feature detection test-all.bin gets successfully built and linked:

  $ ls -la /tmp/build/perf/feature/test-all.bin
  -rwxrwxr-x. 1 acme acme 2680352 Mar 19 11:07 /tmp/build/perf/feature/test-all.bin
  $ nm /tmp/build/perf/feature/test-all.bin  | grep -w disassembler
  0000000000061f90 T disassembler
  $

Time to move on to the patches that make use of this disassembler()
routine in binutils's libopcodes.
