driver core: Attach devices on CPU local to device node

Call the asynchronous probe routines on a CPU local to the device node. By
doing this we should be able to improve our initialization time
significantly as we can avoid having to access the device from a remote
node which may introduce higher latency.

For example, in the case of initializing memory for NVDIMM this can have a
significant impact as initialing 3TB on remote node can take up to 39
seconds while initialing it on a local node only takes 23 seconds. It is
situations like this where we will see the biggest improvement.
