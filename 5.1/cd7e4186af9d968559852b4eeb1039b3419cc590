net/mlx5: E-Switch, Avoid magic numbers when initializing offloads mode

When dealing with the offloads mode initialization, driver refers to
the number of VFs and add magic number one (1) to take account of the
uplink. This is not clear and will make the code less readable after
adding other vports (e.g. host PF). As these are special vports
compared to VF vports, add a helper macro to denote such special
vports and eliminate the use of magic number.

Moreover, when creating offloads flow table and groups, the driver
reserves two more slots for UC and MC miss rules. Replace this magic
number with a helper macro as well.

This patch doesn't change any functionality.
