arm64: apply workaround on A64FX v1r0

Fujitsu erratum 010001 applies to A64FX v0r0 and v1r0, and we try to
handle either by masking MIDR with MIDR_FUJITSU_ERRATUM_010001_MASK
before comparing it to MIDR_FUJITSU_ERRATUM_010001.

Unfortunately, MIDR_FUJITSU_ERRATUM_010001 is constructed incorrectly
using MIDR_VARIANT(), which is intended to extract the variant field
from MIDR_EL1, rather than generate the field in-place. This results in
MIDR_FUJITSU_ERRATUM_010001 being all-ones, and we only match A64FX
v0r0.

This patch uses MIDR_CPU_VAR_REV() to generate an in-place mask for the
variant field, ensuring the we match both v0r0 and v1r0.
