mlxsw: spectrum_router: Offload blackhole routes

Create a new FIB entry type for blackhole routes and set it in case the
type of the notified route is 'RTN_BLACKHOLE'.

Program such routes with a discard action and mark them as offloaded
since the device is dropping the packets instead of the kernel.
