rtc: s3c: Rewrite clock handling

s3c_rtc_enable/disable_clk() functions were designed to be called multiple
times without reference counting, because they were initially only used in
alarm setting/clearing functions, which can be called both when alarm is
already set or not. Later however, calls to those functions have been added to
other places in the driver - like time and /proc reading callbacks, what
results in broken alarm if any of such events happens after the alarm has
been set. Fix this by simplifying s3c_rtc_enable/disable_clk() functions
to rely on proper reference counting in clock core and move alarm enable
counter to s3c_rtc_setaie() function.
