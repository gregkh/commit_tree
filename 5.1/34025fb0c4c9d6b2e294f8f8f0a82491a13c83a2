IB/hfi1: Prioritize the sending of ACK packets

ACK packets are generally associated with request completion and resource
release and therefore should be sent first. This patch optimizes the
send engine by using the following policies:
(1) QPs with RVT_S_ACK_PENDING bit set in qp->s_flags or qpriv->s_flags
should have their priority incremented;
(2) QPs with ACK or TID-ACK packet queued should have their priority
incremented;
(3) When a QP is queued to the wait list due to resource constraints, it
will be queued to the head if it has ACK packet to send;
(4) When selecting qps to run from the wait list, the one with the highest
priority and starve_cnt will be selected; each priority will be equivalent
to a fixed number of starve_cnt (16).
