habanalabs: fix bug when mapping very large memory area

This patch fixes a bug of allocating a too big memory size with kmalloc,
which causes a failure.
In case of mapping a large memory block, an array of the relevant physical
page addresses is allocated. If there are many pages the array might be
too big to allocate with kmalloc, hence changing to kvmalloc.
