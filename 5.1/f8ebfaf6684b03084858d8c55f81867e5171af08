net: bpf: remove XDP_QUERY_XSK_UMEM enumerator

Commit c9b47cc1fabc ("xsk: fix bug when trying to use both copy and
zero-copy on one queue id") moved the umem query code to the AF_XDP
core, and therefore removed the need to query the netdevice for a
umem.

This patch removes XDP_QUERY_XSK_UMEM and all code that implement that
behavior, which is just dead code.
