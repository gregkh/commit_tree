mlxsw: spectrum: Expose functions to create and destroy underlay RIF

In Spectrum-2, instead of providing the ID of the virtual router (VR)
where NVE underlay lookups will occur as in Spectrum-1, the ID of a
router interface (RIF) in this VR is required.

Expose functions to create and destroy such a RIF.
