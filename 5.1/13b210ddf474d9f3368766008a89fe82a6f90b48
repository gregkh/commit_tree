efi: Let architectures decide the flags that should be saved/restored

Currently, irqflags are saved before calling runtime services and
checked for mismatch on return.

Provide a pair of overridable macros to save and restore (if needed) the
state that need to be preserved on return from a runtime service.
This allows to check for flags that are not necesarly related to
irqflags.
