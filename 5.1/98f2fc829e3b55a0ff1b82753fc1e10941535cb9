EDAC, skx_edac: Delete duplicated code

Delete the duplicated code from skx_edac.c and rename skx_edac.c to
skx_base.c. Update the Makefile to build the skx_edac driver from
skx_base.c and skx_common.c.

Add SPDX to skx_base.c and clean out unnecessary #include lines.

 [ bp: Drop the license boilerplate - there's an SPDX identifier now. ]
