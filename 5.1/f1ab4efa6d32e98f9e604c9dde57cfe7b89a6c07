IB/hfi1: Enable TID RDMA READ protocol

This patch enables TID RDMA READ protocol by converting a qualified
RDMA READ request into a TID RDMA READ request internally:
(1) The TID RDMA capability must be enabled;
(2) The request must start on a 4K page boundary and all receiving
 buffers must start on 4K page boundaries;
(3) The request length must be a multiple of 4K and must be larger or
equal to 256K. Each receiving buffer length must be a multiple of 4K.
