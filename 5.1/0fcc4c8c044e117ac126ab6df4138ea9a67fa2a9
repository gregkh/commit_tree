device_cgroup: fix RCU imbalance in error case

When dev_exception_add() returns an error (due to a failed memory
allocation), make sure that we move the RCU preemption count back to where
it was before we were called. We dropped the RCU read lock inside the loop
body, so we can't just "break".

sparse complains about this, too:

$ make -s C=2 security/device_cgroup.o
./include/linux/rcupdate.h:647:9: warning: context imbalance in
'propagate_exception' - unexpected unlock
