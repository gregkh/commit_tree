PCI: pci-bridge-emul: Extend pci_bridge_emul_init() with flags

Depending on the capabilities of the PCI controller/platform, the
PCI-to-PCI bridge emulation behavior might need to be different. For
example, on platforms that use the pci-mvebu code, we currently don't
support prefetchable memory BARs, so the corresponding fields in the
PCI-to-PCI bridge configuration space should be read-only.

To implement this, extend pci_bridge_emul_init() to take a "flags"
argument, with currently one flag supported:

PCI_BRIDGE_EMUL_NO_PREFETCHABLE_BAR

that will make the prefetchable memory base and limit registers
read-only.

The pci-mvebu and pci-aardvark drivers are updated accordingly.
