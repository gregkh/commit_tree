ALSA: pci: Remove superfluous snd_info_register() calls

The calls of snd_info_register() are superfluous and should be avoided
at the procfs creation time.  They are called at the end of the whole
initialization via snd_card_register().  This patch drops such
superfluous calls, as well as dropping the superfluous setup of
SNDRV_INFO_CONTENT_TEXT.
