Bluetooth: hci_event: Use struct_size() helper

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes, in particular in the
context in which this code is being used.

So, change the following form:

sizeof(*ev) + ev->num_hndl * sizeof(struct hci_comp_pkts_info)

 to :

struct_size(ev, handles, ev->num_hndl)

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
