drm/i915: Pipeline PDP updates for Braswell

Currently we face a severe problem on Braswell that manifests as invalid
ppGTT accesses. The code tries to maintain the PDP (page directory
pointers) inside the context in two ways, direct write into the context
and a pipelined LRI update. The direct write into the context is
fundamentally racy as it is unserialised with any access (read or write)
the GPU is doing. By asserting that Braswell is not used with vGPU
(currently an unsupported platform) we can eliminate the dangerous
direct write into the context image and solely use the pipelined update.

However, the LRI of the PDP fouls up the GPU, causing it to freeze and
take out the machine with "forcewake ack timeouts". This seems possible
to workaround by preventing the GPU from sleeping (via means of
disabling the power-state management interface, i.e. forcing each ring
to remain awake) around the update. Equally, it seems an EMIT_INVALIDATE
before the LRI is sufficient to prevent the forcewake errors.
