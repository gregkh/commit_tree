bcache: export backing_dev_uuid via sysfs

When there are multiple bcache devices, after a reboot the name of
bcache devices may change (e.g. current /dev/bcache1 was /dev/bcache0
before reboot). Therefore we need the backing device UUID (sb.uuid) to
identify each bcache device.

Backing device uuid can be found by program bcache-super-show, but
directly exporting backing_dev_uuid by sysfs file
/sys/block/bcache<?>/bcache/backing_dev_uuid is a much simpler method.

With backing_dev_uuid, and partition uuids from /dev/disk/by-partuuid/,
now we can identify each bcache device and its partitions conveniently.
