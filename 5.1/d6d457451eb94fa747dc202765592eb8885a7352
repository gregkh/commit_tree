perf tools: Fix split_kallsyms_for_kcore() for trampoline symbols

Kallsyms symbols do not have a size, so the size becomes the distance to
the next symbol.

Consequently the recently added trampoline symbols end up with large
sizes because the trampolines are some distance from one another and the
main kernel map.

However, symbols that end outside their map can disrupt the symbol tree
because, after mapping, it can appear incorrectly that they overlap
other symbols.

Add logic to truncate symbol size to the end of the corresponding map.
