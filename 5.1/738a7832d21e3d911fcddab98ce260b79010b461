signal: use fdget() since we don't allow O_PATH

As stated in the original commit for pidfd_send_signal() we don't allow
to signal processes through O_PATH file descriptors since it is
semantically equivalent to a write on the pidfd.

We already correctly error out right now and return EBADF if an O_PATH
fd is passed.  This is because we use file->f_op to detect whether a
pidfd is passed and O_PATH fds have their file->f_op set to empty_fops
in do_dentry_open() and thus fail the test.

Thus, there is no regression.  It's just semantically correct to use
fdget() and return an error right from there instead of taking a
reference and returning an error later.
