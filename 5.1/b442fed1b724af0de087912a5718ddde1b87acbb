mlxsw: core: Do not use WQ_MEM_RECLAIM for mlxsw workqueue

The workqueue is used to periodically update the networking stack about
activity / statistics of various objects such as neighbours and TC
actions.

It should not be called as part of memory reclaim path, so remove the
WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag.
