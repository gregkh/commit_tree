PCI/LINK: Supply IRQ handler so level-triggered IRQs are acked

A threaded IRQ with a NULL handler does not work with level-triggered
interrupts.  request_threaded_irq() will return an error:

  genirq: Threaded irq requested with handler=NULL and !ONESHOT for irq 16
  pcie_bw_notification: probe of 0000:00:1b.0:pcie010 failed with error -22

For level interrupts we need to silence the interrupt before exiting the
IRQ handler, so just clear the PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_LBMS bit there.
