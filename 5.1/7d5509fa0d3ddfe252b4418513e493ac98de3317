net: sched: extend proto ops with 'put' callback

Add optional tp->ops->put() API to be implemented for filter reference
counting. This new function is called by cls API to release filter
reference for filters returned by tp->ops->change() or tp->ops->get()
functions. Implement tfilter_put() helper to call tp->ops->put() only for
classifiers that implement it.
