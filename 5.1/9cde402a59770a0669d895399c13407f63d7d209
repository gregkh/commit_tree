PCI: Add function 1 DMA alias quirk for Marvell 9170 SATA controller

There is a Marvell 88SE9170 PCIe SATA controller I found on a board here.
Some quick testing with the ARM SMMU enabled reveals that it suffers from
the same requester ID mixup problems as the other Marvell chips listed
already.

Add the PCI vendor/device ID to the list of chips which need the
workaround.
