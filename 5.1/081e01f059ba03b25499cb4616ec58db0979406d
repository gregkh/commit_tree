ALSA: hda: Fix mismatches for register mask and value in hdac controller

E.g. for azx_int_enable(), we should set both mask and value to be
"AZX_INT_CTRL_EN | AZX_INT_GLOBAL_EN"(the mask was 0) to enable
controller CIE and GIE.

We have similar issues on setting AZX_GCTL_RESET and AZX_GCTL_UNSOL,
here try to correct all of them.
