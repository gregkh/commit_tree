ipmi: ipmi_si_hardcode.c: init si_type array to fix a crash

The intended behavior of function ipmi_hardcode_init_one() is to default
to kcs interface when no type argument is presented when initializing
ipmi with hard coded addresses.

However, the array of char pointers allocated on the stack by function
ipmi_hardcode_init() was not inited to zeroes, so it contained stack
debris.

Consequently, passing the cruft stored in this array to function
ipmi_hardcode_init_one() caused a crash when it was unable to detect
that the char * being passed was nonsense and tried to access the
address specified by the bogus pointer.

The fix is simply to initialize the si_type array to zeroes, so if
there were no type argument given to at the command line, function
ipmi_hardcode_init_one() could properly default to the kcs interface.
