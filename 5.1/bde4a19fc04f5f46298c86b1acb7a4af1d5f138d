binder: use userspace pointer as base of buffer space

Now that alloc->buffer points to the userspace vm_area
rename buffer->data to buffer->user_data and rename
local pointers that hold user addresses. Also use the
"__user" tag to annotate all user pointers so sparse
can flag cases where user pointer vaues  are copied to
kernel pointers. Refactor code to use offsets instead
of user pointers.
