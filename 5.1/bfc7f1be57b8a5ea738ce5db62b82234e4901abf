batman-adv: Add hop_penalty mesh genl configuration

The TQ (B.A.T.M.A.N. IV) and throughput values (B.A.T.M.A.N. V) are reduced
when they are forwarded. One of the reductions is the penalty for
traversing an additional hop. This hop_penalty (0-255) defines the
percentage of reduction (0-100%).

The BATADV_CMD_SET_MESH/BATADV_CMD_GET_MESH commands allow to set/get the
configuration of this feature using the u8 BATADV_ATTR_HOP_PENALTY
attribute.
