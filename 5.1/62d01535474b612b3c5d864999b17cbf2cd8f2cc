net: phy: marvell10g: add support for the 88x2110 PHY

This patch adds support for the 88x2110 PHY, which is similar to the
already supported 88x3310 PHY without the SFP interface.

It supports 10/100/1000BASET along with 2.5GBASET, 5GBASET and 10GBASET,
with the same interface modes that are used by the 3310.

This PHY don't have the same issue as the 88x3310 regarding 2.5/5G
abilities, and correctly follows the 802.3bz standard to list the
supported abilities.
