mlxsw: spectrum: Fix autoneg status in ethtool

If link is down and autoneg is set to on/off, the status in ethtool does
not change.

The reason is when the link is down the function returns with zero
before changing autoneg value.

Move the checking of link state (up/down) to be performed after setting
autoneg value, in order to be sure that autoneg will change in any case.
