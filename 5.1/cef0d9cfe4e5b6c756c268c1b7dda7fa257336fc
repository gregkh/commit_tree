drm: rcar-du: Replace EXT_CTRL_REGS feature flag with generation check

The RCAR_DU_FEATURE_EXT_CTRL_REGS feature flag is missing for H1 only,
which is a first generation device, not a second generation device as
reported in the device information table. Fix the H1 generation and use
generation checks to replace the feature flag.
