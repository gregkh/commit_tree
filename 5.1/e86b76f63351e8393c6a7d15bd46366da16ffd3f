pxa168_eth: pass struct device to DMA API functions

The DMA API generally relies on a struct device to work properly, and
only barely works without one for legacy reasons.  Pass the easily
available struct device from the platform_device to remedy this.

Note that this driver seems to entirely lack dma_map_single error
handling, but that is left for another time.
