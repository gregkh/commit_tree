KVM: s390: add functions to (un)register GISC with GISA

Add the Interruption Alert Mask (IAM) to the architecture specific
kvm struct. This mask in the GISA is used to define for which ISC
a GIB alert will be issued.

The functions kvm_s390_gisc_register() and kvm_s390_gisc_unregister()
are used to (un)register a GISC (guest ISC) with a virtual machine and
its GISA.

Upon successful completion, kvm_s390_gisc_register() returns the
ISC to be used for GIB alert interruptions. A negative return code
indicates an error during registration.

Theses functions will be used by other adapter types like AP and PCI to
request pass-through interruption support.
