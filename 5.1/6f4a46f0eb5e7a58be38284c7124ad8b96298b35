hwmon: (pmbus) associate PMBUS_SKIP_STATUS_CHECK with driver data

Current code compares device name with name in i2c_device_id to decide
whether PMBUS_SKIP_STATUS_CHECK should be set in pmbus_platform_data,
which makes adding new devices with PMBUS_SKIP_STATUS_CHECK should also
modify code in pmbus_probe().

This patch adds pmbus_device_info to save pages and flags. Its pointer
is put in driver_data of i2c_device_id, which makes adding new device
more straightforward.
