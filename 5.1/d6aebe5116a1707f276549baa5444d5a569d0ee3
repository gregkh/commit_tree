ARM: s5pv210_defconfig: Enable more drivers present on Samsung Aries

Enable following drivers for Samsung Aries family of devices:
- I2C support (using s3c2410 driver)
- s5p-jpeg
- s5p-mfc
- Exynos DRM rotator
- PWM support
- PWM vibrator
- Fixed regulator
- Syscon poweroff
- Atmel maXTouch touchscreen
- Broadcom BCM4329 Bluetooth over UART0
- DMA devices (so we can use pl330 DMA driver)

Disable DEBUG_LL. It's currently set to UART1, but if we want to use it
on Aries, we would need to switch it to UART2, to get any logs.
