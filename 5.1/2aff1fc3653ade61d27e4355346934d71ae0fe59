media: ov5640: Disable transparent feature for test pattern

The transparent feature for test patterns blends the test pattern with
an actual captured image. This makes the result non-static, subject to
changes in the sensor's field of view.

Test patterns should be predictable and deterministic, even if they are
dynamic patterns. Disable the transparent feature of the test pattern.
