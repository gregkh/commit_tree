net: hns: Fix sparse: some warnings in HNS drivers

There are some sparse warnings in the HNS drivers:

warning: incorrect type in assignment (different address spaces)
    expected void [noderef] <asn:2> *io_base
    got void *vaddr
warning: cast removes address space '<asn:2>' of expression
[...]

Add __iomem and change all the u8 __iomem to void __iomem to
fix these kind of  warnings.

warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)
    expected void [noderef] <asn:2> *base
    got unsigned char [usertype] *base_addr
warning: cast to restricted __le16
warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
    expected unsigned int [usertype] tbl_tcam_data_high
    got restricted __le32 [usertype]
warning: cast to restricted __le32
[...]

These variables used u32/u16 as their type, and finally as a
parameter of writel(), writel() will do the cpu_to_le32 coversion
so remove the little endian covert code to fix these kind of warnings.
