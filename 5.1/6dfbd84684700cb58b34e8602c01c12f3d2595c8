CIFS: Fix read after write for files with read caching

When we have a READ lease for a file and have just issued a write
operation to the server we need to purge the cache and set oplock/lease
level to NONE to avoid reading stale data. Currently we do that
only if a write operation succedeed thus not covering cases when
a request was sent to the server but a negative error code was
returned later for some other reasons (e.g. -EIOCBQUEUED or -EINTR).
Fix this by turning off caching regardless of the error code being
returned.

The patches fixes generic tests 075 and 112 from the xfs-tests.
