drm/amd/display: If one stream full updates, full update all planes

[Why]
On some compositors, with two monitors attached, VT terminal
switch can cause a graphical issue by the following means:

There are two streams, one for each monitor. Each stream has one
plane

current state:
	M1:S1->P1
	M2:S2->P2

The user calls for a terminal switch and a commit is made to
change both planes to linear swizzle mode. In atomic check,
a new dc_state is constructed with new planes on each stream

new state:
	M1:S1->P3
	M2:S2->P4

In commit tail, each stream is committed, one at a time. The first
stream (S1) updates properly, triggerring a full update and replacing
the state

current state:
	M1:S1->P3
	M2:S2->P4

The update for S2 comes in, but dc detects that there is no difference
between the stream and plane in the new and current states, and so
triggers a fast update. The fast update does not program swizzle,
so the second monitor is corrupted

[How]
Add a flag to dc_plane_state that forces full updates

When a stream undergoes a full update, set this flag on all changed
planes, then clear it on the current stream

Subsequent streams will get full updates as a result
