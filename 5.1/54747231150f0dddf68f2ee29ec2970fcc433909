RDMA: Introduce and use rdma_device_to_ibdev()

Introduce and use rdma_device_to_ibdev() API for those drivers which are
registering one sysfs group and also use in ib_core.

In subsequent patch, device->provider_ibdev one-to-one mapping is no
longer holds true during accessing sysfs entries.
Therefore, introduce an API rdma_device_to_ibdev() that provides such
information.
