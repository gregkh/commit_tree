usb: typec: mux: Fix unsigned comparison with less than zero

The return from the call to fwnode_property_read_u16_array is int,
it can be a negative error code however this is being assigned to
an size_t variable 'nval', hence the check is always false.
Fix this by making 'nval' an int.

Detected by Coccinelle ("Unsigned expression compared with
zero: nval < 0")
