This patch adds I2C interface timing registers support for
proper bus rate configuration along with meeting the I2C spec
setup and hold times based on the tuning performed on Tegra210,
Tegra186 and Tegra194 platforms.

I2C_INTERFACE_TIMING_0 register contains TLOW and THIGH field
and Tegra I2C controller design uses them as a part of internal
clock divisor.

I2C_INTERFACE_TIMING_1 register contains the setup and hold times
