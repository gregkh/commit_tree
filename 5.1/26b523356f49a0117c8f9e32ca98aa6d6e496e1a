powerpc: Drop page_is_ram() and walk_system_ram_range()

Since commit c40dd2f76644 ("powerpc: Add System RAM to /proc/iomem")
it is possible to use the generic walk_system_ram_range() and
the generic page_is_ram().

To enable the use of walk_system_ram_range() by the IBM EHEA ethernet
driver, we still need an export of the generic function.

As powerpc was the only user of CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_WALK_MEMORY, the
ifdef around the generic walk_system_ram_range() has become useless
and can be dropped.
