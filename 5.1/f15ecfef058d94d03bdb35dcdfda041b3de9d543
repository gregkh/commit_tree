fuse: Introduce fi->lock to protect write related fields

To minimize contention of fc->lock, this patch introduces a new spinlock
for protection fuse_inode metadata:

fuse_inode:
	writectr
	writepages
	write_files
	queued_writes
	attr_version

inode:
	i_size
	i_nlink
	i_mtime
	i_ctime

Also, it protects the fields changed in fuse_change_attributes_common()
(too many to list).
