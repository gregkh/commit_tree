mm, compaction: rearrange compact_control

compact_control spans two cache lines with write-intensive lines on
both.  Rearrange so the most write-intensive fields are in the same
cache line.  This has a negligible impact on the overall performance of
compaction and is more a tidying exercise than anything.
