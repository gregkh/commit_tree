kbuild: remove meaningless prepare2 target

There is no build order among the following:
  prepare3
  outputmakefile
  asm-generic
  $(version_h)
  $(autoksyms_h)
  include/generated/utsrelease.h

It is meaningless to insert the prepare2 target between the first
three and the last three.

The comment says, "prepare2 creates a makefile if using a separate
output directory." Let me explain it more precisely. The prepare
targets cannot be executed without the .config file. Because the
configuration targets depend on the outputmakefile target, the
generated makefile is already there before the parepare2 is run.
