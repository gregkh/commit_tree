fsnotify: send all event types to super block marks

So far, existence of super block marks was checked only on events with
data type FSNOTIFY_EVENT_PATH. Use the super block of the "to_tell" inode
to report the events of all event types to super block marks.

This change has no effect on current backends. Soon, this will allow
fanotify backend to receive all event types on a super block mark.
