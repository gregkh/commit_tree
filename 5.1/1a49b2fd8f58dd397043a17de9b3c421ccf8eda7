kbuild: strip whitespace in cmd_record_mcount findstring

CC_FLAGS_FTRACE may contain trailing whitespace that interferes with
findstring.

For example, commit 6977f95e63b9 ("powerpc: avoid -mno-sched-epilog on
GCC 4.9 and newer") introduced a change such that on my ppc64le box,
CC_FLAGS_FTRACE="-pg -mprofile-kernel ".  (Note the trailing space.)
When cmd_record_mcount is now invoked, findstring fails as the ftrace
flags were found at very end of _c_flags, without the trailing space.

  _c_flags=" ... -pg -mprofile-kernel"
  CC_FLAGS_FTRACE="-pg -mprofile-kernel "
                                       ^
    findstring is looking for this extra space

Remove the redundant whitespaces from CC_FLAGS_FTRACE in
cmd_record_mcount to avoid this problem.

[masahiro.yamada: This issue only happens in the released versions
of GNU Make. CC_FLAGS_FTRACE will not contain the trailing space if
you use the latest GNU Make, which contains commit b90fabc8d6f3
("* NEWS: Do not insert a space during '+=' if the value is empty.") ]
