net: dsa: microchip: add MIB counter reading support

Add background MIB counter reading support.

Port MIB counters should only be read when there is link.  Otherwise it is
a waste of time as hardware never increases those counters.  There are
exceptions as some switches keep track of dropped counts no matter what.
