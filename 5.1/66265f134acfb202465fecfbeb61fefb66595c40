CIFS: Count SMB3 credits for malformed pending responses

Even if a response is malformed, we should count credits
granted by the server to avoid miscalculations and unnecessary
reconnects due to client or server bugs. If the response has
been received partially, the session will be reconnected anyway
on the next iteration of the demultiplex thread, so counting
credits for such cases shouldn't break things.
