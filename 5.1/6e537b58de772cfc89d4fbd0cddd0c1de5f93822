media: imx: vdic: rely on VDIC for correct field order

prepare_vdi_in_buffers() was setting up the dma pointers as if the
VDIC is always programmed to receive the fields in bottom-top order,
i.e. as if ipu_vdi_set_field_order() only programs BT order in the VDIC.
But that's not true, ipu_vdi_set_field_order() is working correctly.

So fix prepare_vdi_in_buffers() to give the VDIC the fields in whatever
order they were received by the video source, and rely on the VDIC to
sort out which is top and which is bottom.
