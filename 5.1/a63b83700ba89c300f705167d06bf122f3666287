nvme: put ns_head ref if namespace fails allocation

In case nvme_alloc_ns fails after we initialize ns_head but before we
add the ns to the controller namespaces list we need to explicitly put
the ns_head reference because when we teardown the controller we
won't find it, causing us to leak a dangling subsystem eventually.
