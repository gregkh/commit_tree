ASoC: da7219: MCLK should be enabled before DAI clocks

For platforms using the Common Clock Framework to control the
codec's DAI clocks, MCLK should be enabled prior to DAI clocks
being turned on. For some platforms the codec is already
provided with an MCLK reference and can therefore control MCLK
itself as it needs to.

To improve functionality MCLK is now added as a parent to the
DAI clocks, if MCLK was provided, so that if they are enabled MCLK
will automatically be enabled as a prerequisite by the CCF.
