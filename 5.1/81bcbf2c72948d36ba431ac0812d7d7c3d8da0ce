ASoC: samsung: i2s: Move registers cache to common driver data structure

There is no need to keep the PM suspend/resume register cache separate
for each DAI as those registers are common, move related i2s_dai data
structure to the driver's common data structure.  This will allow us
to simplify the code a little eventually and to make it easier to follow.
