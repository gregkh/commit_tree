ASoC: samsung: i2s: Fix multiple "IIS multi" devices initialization

On some SoCs (e.g. Exynos5433) there are multiple "IIS multi audio
interfaces" and the driver will try to register there multiple times
same platform device for the secondary FIFO, which of course fails
miserably.  To fix this we derive the secondary platform device name
from the primary device name. The secondary device name will now
be <primary_dev_name>-sec instead of fixed "samsung-i2s-sec".

The fixed platform_device_id table entry is removed as the secondary
device name is now dynamic and device/driver matching is done through
driver_override.
