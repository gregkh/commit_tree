r8169: improve rx buffer allocation

8 years ago, as part of 6f0333b8fde4 ("r8169: use 50% less ram for RX
ring"), the alignment requirement for rx buffers was silently changed
from 8 bytes to 16 bytes. I found nothing explaining this, also the
chip specs I have only mention an 8 byte requirement.
AFAICS kmalloc_node() guarantees allocated memory to be at least
"long long" aligned, what is 8 bytes on a 32 bit machine.
So we can take this memory as-is and avoid some overhead by changing
the alignment requirement back to 8 bytes.
