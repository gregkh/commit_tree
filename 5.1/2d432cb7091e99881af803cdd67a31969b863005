mm: prevent mapping slab pages to userspace

It's never appropriate to map a page allocated by SLAB into userspace.
A buggy device driver might try this, or an attacker might be able to
find a way to make it happen.

Christoph said:

: Let's just fail the code.  Currently this may work with SLUB.  But SLAB
: and SLOB overlay fields with mapcount.  So you would have a corrupted page
: struct if you mapped a slab page to user space.
