dt-bindings: memory: tegra: Squash tegra20-gart into tegra20-mc

Splitting GART and Memory Controller wasn't a good decision that was made
back in the day. Given that the GART driver wasn't ever been used by
anything in the kernel, we decided that it will be better to correct the
mistakes of the past and merge two bindings into a single one. As a result
there is a DT ABI change for the Memory Controller that allows not to
break newer kernels using older DT and not to break older kernels using
newer DT, that is done by changing the 'compatible' of the node to
'tegra20-mc-gart' and adding a new-required clock property. The new clock
property also puts the tegra20-mc binding in line with the bindings of the
later Tegra generations.
