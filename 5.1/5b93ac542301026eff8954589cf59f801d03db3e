OPP: Add support for parsing the 'opp-level' property

Now that the OPP bindings are updated to include an optional
'opp-level' property, add support to parse it from device tree
and store it as part of dev_pm_opp structure.
Also add and export an helper 'dev_pm_opp_get_level()' that can be
used to get the level value read from device tree when present.
