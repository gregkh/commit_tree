convert do_remount_sb() to fs_context

Replace do_remount_sb() with a function, reconfigure_super(), that's
fs_context aware.  The fs_context is expected to be parameterised already
and have ->root pointing to the superblock to be reconfigured.

A legacy wrapper is provided that is intended to be called from the
fs_context ops when those appear, but for now is called directly from
reconfigure_super().  This wrapper invokes the ->remount_fs() superblock op
for the moment.  It is intended that the remount_fs() op will be phased
out.

The fs_context->purpose is set to FS_CONTEXT_FOR_RECONFIGURE to indicate
that the context is being used for reconfiguration.

do_umount_root() is provided to consolidate remount-to-R/O for umount and
emergency remount by creating a context and invoking reconfiguration.

do_remount(), do_umount() and do_emergency_remount_callback() are switched
to use the new process.

[AV -- fold UMOUNT and EMERGENCY_REMOUNT in; fixes the
umount / bug, gets rid of pointless complexity]
[AV -- set ->net_ns in all cases; nfs remount will need that]
[AV -- shift security_sb_remount() call into reconfigure_super(); the callers
that didn't do security_sb_remount() have NULL fc->security anyway, so it's
a no-op for them]
