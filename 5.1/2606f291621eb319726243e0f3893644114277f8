drm/nouveau/mmu: support initialisation of client-managed address-spaces

NVKM is currently responsible for managing the allocation of a client's
GPU address-space, but there's various use-cases (ie. HMM address-space
mirroring) where giving a client more direct control is desirable.

This commit allows for a VMM to be created where the area allocated for
NVKM is limited to a client-specified window, the remainder of address-
space is controlled directly by the client.

Leaving a window is necessary to support various internal requirements,
but also to support existing allocation interfaces as not all of the HW
is capable of working with a HMM allocation.
