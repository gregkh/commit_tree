btrfs: qgroup: Remove duplicated trace points for qgroup_rsv_add/release

Inside qgroup_rsv_add/release(), we have trace events
trace_qgroup_update_reserve() to catch reserved space update.

However we still have two manual trace_qgroup_update_reserve() calls
just outside these functions.  Remove these duplicated calls.
