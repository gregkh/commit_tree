btrfs: move ulist allocation out of transaction in quota enable

The allocation happens with GFP_KERNEL after a transaction has been
started, this can potentially cause deadlock if reclaim tries to get the
memory by flushing filesystem data.

The fs_info::qgroup_ulist is not used during transaction start when
quotas are not enabled. The status bit BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED is set
later in btrfs_quota_enable so it's safe to move it before the
transaction start.
