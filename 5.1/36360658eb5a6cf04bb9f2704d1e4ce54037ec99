s390: vfio_ap: link the vfio_ap devices to the vfio_ap bus subsystem

Libudev relies on having a subsystem link for non-root devices. To
avoid libudev (and potentially other userspace tools) choking on the
matrix device let us introduce a matrix bus and with it the matrix
bus subsytem. Also make the matrix device reside within the matrix
bus.

Doing this we remove the forced link from the matrix device to the
vfio_ap driver and the device_type we do not need anymore.

Since the associated matrix driver is not the vfio_ap driver any more,
we have to change the search for the devices on the vfio_ap driver in
the function vfio_ap_verify_queue_reserved.
