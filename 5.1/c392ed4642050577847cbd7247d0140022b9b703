tty/nozomi: use pci_iomap instead of ioremap_nocache

Use pci_iomap instead of ioremap_nocache in nozomi_card_init(). This
is a cleaner way to do PCI MMIO (performs additional checks) and
allows to drop the manual call to pci_resource_start.

pci_iomap relies on ioremap for MMIO and thus has uncached behavior.
