kbuild: Make NOSTDINC_FLAGS a simply expanded variable

During a simple no-op (nothing changed) build I saw 39 invocations of
the C compiler with the argument "-print-file-name=include".  We don't
need to call the C compiler 39 times for this--one time will suffice.

Let's change NOSTDINC_FLAGS to a simply expanded variable to avoid
this since there doesn't appear to be any reason it should be
recursively expanded.

On my build this shaved ~400 ms off my "no-op" build.

Note that the recursive expansion seems to date back to the (really
old) commit e8f5bdb02ce0 ("[PATCH] Makefile include path ordering").
It's a little unclear to me if the point of that patch was to switch
the variable to be recursively expanded (which it did) or to avoid
directly assigning to NOSTDINC_FLAGS (AKA to switch to +=) because
someone else (out of tree?) was setting it.  I presume later since if
the only goal was to switch to recursive expansion the patch would
have just removed the ":".
