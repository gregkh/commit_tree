cifs: fix handle leak in smb2_query_symlink()

If we enter smb2_query_symlink() for something that is not a symlink
and where the SMB2_open() would succeed we would never end up
closing this handle and would thus leak a handle on the server.

Fix this by immediately calling SMB2_close() on successfull open.
