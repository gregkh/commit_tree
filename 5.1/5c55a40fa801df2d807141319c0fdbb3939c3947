batman-adv: Prepare framework for hardif genl config

The batman-adv configuration interface was implemented solely using sysfs.
This approach was condemned by non-batadv developers as "huge mistake".
Instead a netlink/genl based implementation was suggested.

Beside the mesh/soft-interface specific configuration, the
slave/hard-interface have B.A.T.M.A.N. V specific configuration settings.
The genl interface reflects this by allowing to get/set it using the
hard-interface specific commands.

The BATADV_CMD_GET_HARDIFS (or short version BATADV_CMD_GET_HARDIF) is
reused as get command because it already allow sto dump the content of
other information from the slave/hard-interface which are not yet
configuration specific.

The set command BATADV_CMD_SET_HARDIF will also notify interested userspace
listeners of the "config" mcast group using the BATADV_CMD_SET_HARDIF
command message type that settings might have been changed and what the
current values are.
