xfs: miscellaneous verifier magic value fixups

Most buffer verifiers have hardcoded magic value checks
conditionalized on the version of the filesystem. The magic value
field of the verifier structure facilitates abstraction of some of
this code. Populate the ->magic field of various verifiers to take
advantage of this abstraction. No functional changes.
