hwmon: (pmbus/tps53679) Fix driver info initialization in probe routine

Fix tps53679_probe() by using dynamically allocated "pmbus_driver_info"
structure instead of static. Usage of static structures causes
overwritten of the field "vrm_version", in case the system is equipped
with several tps53679 devices with the different "vrm_version".
In such case the last probed device overwrites this field for all
others.
