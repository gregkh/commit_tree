arm64/module: ftrace: deal with place relative nature of PLTs

Another bodge for the ftrace PLT code: plt_entries_equal() now takes
the place relative nature of the ADRP/ADD based PLT entries into
account, which means that a struct trampoline instance on the stack
is no longer equal to the same set of opcodes in the module struct,
given that they don't point to the same place in memory anymore.

Work around this by using memcmp() in the ftrace PLT handling code.
