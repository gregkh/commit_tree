drm/sun4i: Add support for A23 display pipeline

The A23's display pipeline is similar to the A33. Differences include:

  - Display backend supports larger layers, 8192x8192 instead of 2048x2048

  - TCON has DMA input

  - There is no SAT module packed in the display backend

Add support for the display pipeline and its components.

As the MIPI DSI output device is not officially documented, and there
are no A23 reference devices to test it, it is not covered by this
patch.
