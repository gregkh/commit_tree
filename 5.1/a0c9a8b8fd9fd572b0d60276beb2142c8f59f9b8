teach vfs_get_tree() to handle subtype, switch do_new_mount() to it

Roll the handling of subtypes into do_new_mount() and vfs_get_tree().  The
former determines any subtype string and hangs it off the fs_context; the
latter applies it.

Make do_new_mount() create, parameterise and commit an fs_context and
create a mount for itself rather than calling vfs_kern_mount().

[AV -- missing kstrdup()]
[AV -- ... and no kstrdup() if we get to setting ->s_submount - we
simply transfer it from fc, leaving NULL behind]
[AV -- constify ->s_submount, while we are at it]
