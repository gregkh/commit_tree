clocksource/drivers/exynos_mct: Clear timer interrupt when shutdown

When shutting down the timer, ensure that after we have stopped the
timer any pending interrupts are cleared. This fixes a problem when
suspending, as interrupts are disabled before the timer is stopped,
so the timer interrupt may still be asserted, preventing the system
entering a low power state when the wfi is executed.
