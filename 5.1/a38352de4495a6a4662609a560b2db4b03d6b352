perf script python: Remove explicit shebang from Python scripts

The scripts in scripts/python are intended to be run from 'perf script'
and the Python version used is dictated by how perf was built (PYTHON=).

Also most distros follow pep-0394 which recommends that /usr/bin/python
refer to Python2 and so may not exist on the system (if PYTHON=python3).

- Remove the explicit shebang
- Install the scripts as mode 644
