arm64: KVM: Describe data or unified caches as having 1 set and 1 way

On SMP ARM systems, cache maintenance by set/way should only ever be
done in the context of onlining or offlining CPUs, which is typically
done by bare metal firmware and never in a virtual machine. For this
reason, we trap set/way cache maintenance operations and replace them
with conditional flushing of the entire guest address space.

Due to this trapping, the set/way arguments passed into the set/way
ops are completely ignored, and thus irrelevant. This also means that
the set/way geometry is equally irrelevant, and we can simply report
it as 1 set and 1 way, so that legacy 32-bit ARM system software (i.e.,
the kind that only receives odd fixes) doesn't take a performance hit
due to the trapping when iterating over the cachelines.
