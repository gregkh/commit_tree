ARM: dts: qcom: pma8084: add interrupt controller properties

Add interrupt controller properties now that spmi-gpio is a proper
hierarchical IRQ chip. The interrupts property is no longer needed so
remove it.

This change was not tested on any hardware but the same change was
tested on qcom-pm8941.dtsi using a LG Nexus 5 (hammerhead) phone with
no issues.
