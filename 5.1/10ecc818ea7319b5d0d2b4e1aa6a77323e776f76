PCI/ASPM: Use LTR if already enabled by platform

RussianNeuroMancer reported that the Intel 7265 wifi on a Dell Venue 11 Pro
7140 table stopped working after wakeup from suspend and bisected the
problem to 9ab105deb60f ("PCI/ASPM: Disable ASPM L1.2 Substate if we don't
have LTR").  David Ward reported the same problem on a Dell Latitude 7350.

After af8bb9f89838 ("PCI/ACPI: Request LTR control from platform before
using it"), we don't enable LTR unless the platform has granted LTR control
to us.  In addition, we don't notice if the platform had already enabled
LTR itself.

After 9ab105deb60f ("PCI/ASPM: Disable ASPM L1.2 Substate if we don't have
LTR"), we avoid using LTR if we don't think the path to the device has LTR
enabled.

The combination means that if the platform itself enables LTR but declines
to give the OS control over LTR, we unnecessarily avoided using ASPM L1.2.
