kbuild: force all architectures except um to include mandatory-y

Currently, every arch/*/include/uapi/asm/Kbuild explicitly includes
the common Kbuild.asm file. Factor out the duplicated include directives
to scripts/Makefile.asm-generic so that no architecture would opt out
of the mandatory-y mechanism.

um is not forced to include mandatory-y since it is a very exceptional
case which does not support UAPI.
