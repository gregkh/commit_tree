KVM: arm/arm64: Update MAINTAINERS entries

For historical reasons, KVM/arm and KVM/arm64 have had different
entries in the MAINTAINER file. This makes little sense, as they are
maintained together.

On top of that, we have a bunch of talented people helping with
the reviewing, and they deserve to be mentioned in the consolidated
entry.
