scsi: ibmvfc: Remove "failed" from logged errors

The text of messages logged with ibmvfc_log_error() always contain the term
"failed". In the case of cancelled commands during EH they are reported
back by the VIOS using error codes. This can be confusing to somebody
looking at these log messages as to whether a command was successfully
cancelled. The following real log message for example it is unclear if the
transaction was actaully cancelled.

<6>sd 0:0:1:1: Cancelling outstanding commands.
<3>sd 0:0:1:1: [sde] Command (28) failed: transaction cancelled (2:6) flags: 0 fcp_rsp: 0, resid=0, scsi_status: 0

Remove prefixing of "failed" to all error logged messages. The
ibmvfc_log_error() function translates the returned error/status codes to a
human readable message already.
