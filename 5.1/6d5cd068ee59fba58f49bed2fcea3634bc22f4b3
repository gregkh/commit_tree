mmc: sdhci: use WP GPIO in sdhci_check_ro()

Even though SDHCI controllers may have a dedicated WP pin that can be
queried using the SDHCI_PRESENT_STATE register, some platforms may
chose to use a separate regular GPIO to route the WP signal. Such a
GPIO is typically represented using the wp-gpios property in the
Device Tree.

Unfortunately, the current sdhci_check_ro() function does not make use
of such GPIO when available: it either uses a host controller specific
->get_ro() operation, or uses the SDHCI_PRESENT_STATE. Several host
controller specific ->get_ro() functions are implemented just to check
a WP GPIO state.

Instead of pushing this to more controller-specific implementations,
let's handle this in the core SDHCI code, just like it is already done
for the CD GPIO in sdhci_get_cd().

The below patch simply changes sdhci_check_ro() to use the value of
the WP GPIO if available.
