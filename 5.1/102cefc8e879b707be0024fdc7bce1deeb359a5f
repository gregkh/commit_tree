ASoC: ab8500: Mark expected switch fall-through

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch
cases where we are expecting to fall through.

This patch fixes the following warning:

In file included from sound/soc/codecs/ab8500-codec.c:24:
sound/soc/codecs/ab8500-codec.c: In function ‘ab8500_codec_set_dai_fmt’:
./include/linux/device.h:1485:2: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
  _dev_err(dev, dev_fmt(fmt), ##__VA_ARGS__)
  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   dev_err(dai->component->dev,
   ^~~~~~~
sound/soc/codecs/ab8500-codec.c:2132:2: note: here
  default:
  ^~~~~~~

Warning level 3 was used: -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3

This patch is part of the ongoing efforts to enable
-Wimplicit-fallthrough.
