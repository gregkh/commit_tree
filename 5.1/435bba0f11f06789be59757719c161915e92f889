regmap: Remove attribute packed from struct 'regcache_rbtree_node'

On one hand commit 28644c809f44 ("regmap: Add the rbtree cache support")
added 'regcache_rbtree_node' as packed structure, while on the other hand
commit e977145aeaad ("[RBTREE] Add explicit alignment to sizeof(long)
for struct rb_node.") declared struct 'rb_node' as aligned.

Solve the ambiguity of placing aligned structure in a packed one by
removing the packed attribute from struct. This seems to be the behavior
of gcc anyway.

This removes the following warning (W=1):

  drivers/base/regmap/regcache-rbtree.c:36:1: warning: alignment 1 of 'struct regcache_rbtree_node' is less than 4 [-Wpacked-not-aligned]
