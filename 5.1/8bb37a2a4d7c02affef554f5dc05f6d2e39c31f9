ALSA: hda/realtek: Enable audio jacks of ASUS UX362FA with ALC294

The ASUS UX362FA with ALC294 cannot detect the headset MIC and outputs
through the internal speaker and the headphone.  This issue can be fixed
by the quirk in the commit 4e0511067 ALSA: hda/realtek: Enable audio
jacks of ASUS UX533FD with ALC294.

Besides, ASUS UX362FA and UX533FD have the same audio initial pin config
values.  So, this patch replaces SND_PCI_QUIRK of UX533FD with a new
SND_HDA_PIN_QUIRK which benefits both UX362FA and UX533FD.
