arm64: kdump: no need to mark crashkernel pages manually PG_reserved

The crashkernel is reserved via memblock_reserve().  memblock_free_all()
will call free_low_memory_core_early(), which will go over all reserved
memblocks, marking the pages as PG_reserved.

So manually marking pages as PG_reserved is not necessary, they are
already in the desired state (otherwise they would have been handed over
to the buddy as free pages and bad things would happen).
