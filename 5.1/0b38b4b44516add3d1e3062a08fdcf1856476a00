ath10k: do not return invalid pointers as a *dentry

When calling debugfs functions, they can now return error values if
something went wrong.  If that happens, return a NULL as a *dentry to
the relay core instead of passing it an illegal pointer.

The relay core should be able to handle an illegal pointer, but add this
check to be safe.
