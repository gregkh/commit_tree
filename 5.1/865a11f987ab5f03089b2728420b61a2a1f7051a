uio/uio_pci_generic: Disable bus-mastering on release

Userspace code using uio_pci_generic may enable bus-mastering by
directly manipulating a PCI device's command register. If a userspace
program enables bus-mastering but exits/crashes uncleanly, bus-
mastering will still be enabled and stale DMA addresses may be
programmed and live in the device.

Disable bus-mastering unconditionally on last close of a UIO PCI fd
to avoid this. If the device did not have bus-mastering enabled,
pci_clear_master() is a no-op.
