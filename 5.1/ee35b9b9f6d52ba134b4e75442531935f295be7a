x86/traps: Have read_cr0() only once in the #NM handler

... instead of twice in the code. In any case, CR0 ends up being read
once anyway:

1. The CONFIG_MATH_EMULATION case does so and exits.
2. The normal case does it once too.

However, read it on function entry instead to make the code even simpler
to follow.

No functional changes.
