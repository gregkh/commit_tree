spi: Support high CS when using descriptors

All controllers using GPIO descriptors can by definition
support high CS connections, so just enforce this when
registering an SPI controller.

This fixes a regression where controllers were missing
SPI_CS_HIGH, the drivers would fail like this:

spi spi0.0: setup: unsupported mode bits 4
cdns-spi fd0b0000.spi: can't setup spi0.0, status -22

This is because as using descriptors moves the CS inversion
logic over to gpiolib, all such controllers are registered
with CS active high.
