xsk: add sock_diag interface for AF_XDP

This patch adds the sock_diag interface for querying sockets from user
space. Tools like iproute2 ss(8) can use this interface to list open
AF_XDP sockets.

The user-space ABI is defined in linux/xdp_diag.h and includes netlink
request and response structs. The request can query sockets and the
response contains socket information about the rings, umems, inode and
more.
