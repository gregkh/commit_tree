LSM: Introduce enum lsm_order

In preparation for distinguishing the "capability" LSM from other LSMs, it
must be ordered first. This introduces LSM_ORDER_MUTABLE for the general
LSMs and LSM_ORDER_FIRST for capability. In the future LSM_ORDER_LAST
for could be added for anything that must run last (e.g. Landlock may
use this).
