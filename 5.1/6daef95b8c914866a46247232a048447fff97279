iov_iter: optimize page_copy_sane()

Avoid cache line miss dereferencing struct page if we can.

page_copy_sane() mostly deals with order-0 pages.

Extra cache line miss is visible on TCP recvmsg() calls dealing
with GRO packets (typically 45 page frags are attached to one skb).

Bringing the 45 struct pages into cpu cache while copying the data
is not free, since the freeing of the skb (and associated
page frags put_page()) can happen after cache lines have been evicted.
