ethtool: reduce stack usage with clang

clang inlines the dev_ethtool() more aggressively than gcc does, leading
to a larger amount of used stack space:

net/core/ethtool.c:2536:24: error: stack frame size of 1216 bytes in function 'dev_ethtool' [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than=]

Marking the sub-functions that require the most stack space as
noinline_for_stack gives us reasonable behavior on all compilers.
