IB/hfi1: Add a function to receive TID RDMA ACK packet

This patch adds a function to receive TID RDMA ACK packet, which could
be an acknowledge to either a TID RDMA WRITE DATA packet or an TID
RDMA RESYNC packet. For an ACK to TID RDMA WRITE DATA packet, the
request segments are completed appropriately. For an ACK to a TID
RDMA RESYNC packet, any pending segment flow information is updated
accordingly.
