net: sched: refactor tc_ctl_chain() to use block->lock

In order to remove dependency on rtnl lock, modify chain API to use
block->lock to protect chain from concurrent modification. Rearrange
tc_ctl_chain() code to call tcf_chain_hold() while holding block->lock to
prevent concurrent chain removal.
