scsi: bfa: bfa_ioc: Mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases where
we are expecting to fall through.

Notice that, in this particular case, I replaced "!!! fall through !!!"
comment with "fall through" annotations, which is what GCC is expecting to
find.
