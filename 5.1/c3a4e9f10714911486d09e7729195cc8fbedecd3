net/mlx5: Add query host params command

The QUERY_HOST_PARAMS command is used by an Embedded CPU Physical
Function (ECPF) driver to identify and retrieve information about the
PF on the host side. E.g, number of virtual functions and PCI BDF.

The number of VFs can be changed on the fly, a function is added to
query current number of VFs and will be used in downstream patches.
