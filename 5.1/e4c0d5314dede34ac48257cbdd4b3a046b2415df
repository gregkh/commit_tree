drm/i915: Apply LUT validation checks to platforms more accurately (v3)

Use of the new DRM_COLOR_LUT_NON_DECREASING test was a bit over-zealous;
it doesn't actually need to be applied to the degamma on "bdw-style"
platforms.  Likewise, we overlooked the fact that CHV should have that
test applied to the gamma LUT as well as the degamma LUT.

Rather than adding more complicated platform checking to
intel_color_check(), let's just store the appropriate set of LUT
validation flags for each platform in the intel_device_info structure.

v2:
 - Shuffle around LUT size tests so that the hardware-specific tests
   won't be applied to legacy gamma tables.  (Ville)
 - Add a debug message so that it will be easier to understand why an
   atomic transaction involving incorrectly-sized LUT's got rejected
   by the driver.

v3:
 - Switch size_t's to int's.  (Ville)
