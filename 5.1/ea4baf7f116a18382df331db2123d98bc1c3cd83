RDMA: Rename port_callback to init_port

Most provider routines are callback routines which ib core invokes.
_callback suffix doesn't convey information about when such callback is
invoked. Therefore, rename port_callback to init_port.

Additionally, store the init_port function pointer in ib_device_ops, so
that it can be accessed in subsequent patches when binding rdma device to
net namespace.
