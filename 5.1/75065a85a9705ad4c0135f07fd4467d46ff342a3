perf report: Use less for scripts output

The UI viewer for scripts output has a lot of limitations: limited size,
no search or save function, slow, and various other issues.

Just use 'less' to display directly on the terminal instead.

This won't work in GTK mode, but GTK doesn't support these context menus
anyways. If that is ever done could use an terminal for the output.
