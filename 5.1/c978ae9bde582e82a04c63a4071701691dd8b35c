drm/dp/mst: Configure no_stop_bit correctly for remote i2c xfers

We aren't supposed to force a stop+start between every i2c msg
when performing multi message transfers. This should eg. cause
the DDC segment address to be reset back to 0 between writing
the segment address and reading the actual EDID extension block.

To quote the E-DDC spec:
"... this standard requires that the segment pointer be
 reset to 00h when a NO ACK or a STOP condition is received."

Since we're going to touch this might as well consult the
I2C_M_STOP flag to determine whether we want to force the stop
or not.
