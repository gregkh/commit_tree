media: coda: fix decoder capture buffer payload

It is not correct to calculate decoder capture payload dynamically from
the decoded frame width and height reported by the firmware. These tell
us what the decoder wrote into the internal framebuffers. The rotator or
VDOA always write the full sizeimage when copying the previously decoded
frame from the internal framebuffers into the capture queue.
