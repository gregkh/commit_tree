tty: n_gsm: Mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch
cases where we are expecting to fall through.

This patch fixes the following warnings:

drivers/tty/n_gsm.c: In function ‘gsm_dlci_data’:
drivers/tty/n_gsm.c:1582:6: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
   if (tty) {
      ^
drivers/tty/n_gsm.c:1587:2: note: here
  case 1:
  ^~~~
drivers/tty/n_gsm.c: In function ‘gsm1_receive’:
  CC [M]  drivers/scsi/snic/snic_disc.o
  CC [M]  drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi/pci.o
  CC      drivers/usb/early/xhci-dbc.o
drivers/tty/n_gsm.c:1981:12: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
   gsm->fcs = INIT_FCS;
            ^
drivers/tty/n_gsm.c:1983:2: note: here
  case GSM_ADDRESS: /* Address continuation */
  ^~~~

Warning level 3 was used: -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3

Notice that, in this particular case, the code comment is modified
in accordance with what GCC is expecting to find.

This patch is part of the ongoing efforts to enable
-Wimplicit-fallthrough.
