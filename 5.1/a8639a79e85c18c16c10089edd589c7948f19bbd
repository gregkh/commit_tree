IB/hfi1: Eliminate opcode tests on mr deref

When an old ack_queue entry is used to store an incoming request, it may
need to clean up the old entry if it is still referencing the
MR. Originally only RDMA READ request needed to reference MR on the
responder side and therefore the opcode was tested when cleaning up the
old entry. The introduction of tid rdma specific operations in the
ack_queue makes the specific opcode tests wrong.  Multiple opcodes (RDMA
READ, TID RDMA READ, and TID RDMA WRITE) may need MR ref cleanup.

Remove the opcode specific tests associated with the ack_queue.
