x86/cpufeature: Add facility to check for min microcode revisions

For bug workarounds or checks, it is useful to check for specific
microcode revisions.

Add a new generic function to match the CPU with stepping.
Add the other function to check the min microcode revisions for
the matched CPU.

A new table format is introduced to facilitate the quirk to
fill the related information.

This does not change the existing x86_cpu_id because it's an ABI
shared with modules, and also has quite different requirements,
as in no wildcards, but everything has to be matched exactly.
