crypto: pcbc - remove bogus memcpy()s with src == dest

The memcpy()s in the PCBC implementation use walk->iv as both the source
and destination, which has undefined behavior.  These memcpy()'s are
actually unneeded, because walk->iv is already used to hold the previous
plaintext block XOR'd with the previous ciphertext block.  Thus,
walk->iv is already updated to its final value.

So remove the broken and unnecessary memcpy()s.
