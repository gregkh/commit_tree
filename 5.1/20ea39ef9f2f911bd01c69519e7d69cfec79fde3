iio: Fix scan mask selection

The trialmask is expected to have all bits set to 0 after allocation.
Currently kmalloc_array() is used which does not zero the memory and so
random bits are set. This results in random channels being enabled when
they shouldn't. Replace kmalloc_array() with kcalloc() which has the same
interface but zeros the memory.

Note the fix is actually required earlier than the below fixes tag, but
will require a manual backport due to move from kmalloc to kmalloc_array.
