tcp_bbr: refactor bbr_target_cwnd() for general inflight provisioning

Because bbr_target_cwnd() is really a general-purpose BBR helper for
computing some volume of inflight data as a function of the estimated
BDP, refactor it into following helper functions:
- bbr_bdp()
- bbr_quantization_budget()
- bbr_inflight()
