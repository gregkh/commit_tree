ASoC: Intel: bytcht_es8316: Add input-map support

After adding jack-detect support we have 3 microphone input switches:
"Microphone 1", "Microphone 2" and "Headset Mic". But the ES8316 has only
2 microphone inputs.

In the app-note explaining how to use the codec and on the 3 boards I
have one input is used for an internal microphone and one for the headset
microphone. On the 2 CHT boards I have the internal mic is on on MIC1 and
the headset mic is on MIC2, on the BYTCR board I have it is the other way
around.

This commit replaces the 2 "Microphone 1" and "Microphone 2" input switches
with a single "Internal Mic" switch and adds support for selecting either
possible input mapping.
