ARM: nhk8815_defconfig: Update defconfig

This updates the NHK8815 defconfig to reflect the recent
structural changes in Kconfigs all over the kernel:

- PREEMPT option was moved around
- MODULES options were moved around
- MTD_NAND options were moved around
- INPUT_MOUSEDEV doesn't have to be explicitly unselected
  anymore (not on by default)
- DEBUG_GPIO should really not be in any default config
- MMC_BLOCK_BOUNCE is gone from Kconfig
- CRYPTO options were moved around
