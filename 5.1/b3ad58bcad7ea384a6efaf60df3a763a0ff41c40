arm64: dts: marvell: armada-37xx: fix USB2 memory region

The specification splits the USB2 memory region into three sections:
1/ 0xD005E000-0xD005EFFF: USB2 Host Controller Registers
2/ 0xD005F000-0xD005F7FF: USB2 UTMI PHY Registers
3/ 0xD005F800-0xD005FFFF: USB2 Host Miscellaneous Registers

Section 1/ belongs to the USB2 node but section 2/ belongs to the UTMI
PHY node. Section 3/ can be accessed by both the USB controller and
the PHY because of the miscaellaneous nature of the registers inside
so a specific node will be created to cover the area and a handle to
it will be added in both the USB controller and the PHY node.
