KVM: s390: add the GIB and its related life-cyle functions

The Guest Information Block (GIB) links the GISA of all guests
that have adapter interrupts pending. These interrupts cannot be
delivered because all vcpus of these guests are currently in WAIT
state or have masked the respective Interruption Sub Class (ISC).
If enabled, a GIB alert is issued on the host to schedule these
guests to run suitable vcpus to consume the pending interruptions.

This mechanism allows to process adapter interrupts for currently
not running guests.

The GIB is created during host initialization and associated with
the Adapter Interruption Facility in case an Adapter Interruption
Virtualization Facility is available.

The GIB initialization and thus the activation of the related code
will be done in an upcoming patch of this series.
