dma-mapping: move debug configuration options to kernel/dma

This is a follow up to the commit cf65a0f6f6ff

  ("dma-mapping: move all DMA mapping code to kernel/dma")

which moved source code of DMA API to kernel/dma folder. Since there is
no file left in the lib that require DMA API debugging options move the
latter to kernel/dma as well.
