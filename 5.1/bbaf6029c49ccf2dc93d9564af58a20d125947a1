samples/bpf: Convert XDP samples to libbpf usage

Some of XDP samples that are attaching the bpf program to the interface
via libbpf's bpf_set_link_xdp_fd are still using the bpf_load.c for
loading and manipulating the ebpf program and maps. Convert them to do
this through libbpf usage and remove bpf_load from the picture.

While at it remove what looks like debug leftover in
xdp_redirect_map_user.c

In xdp_redirect_cpu, change the way that the program to be loaded onto
interface is chosen - user now needs to pass the program's section name
instead of the relative number. In case of typo print out the section
names to choose from.
