ASoC: rsnd: src: Avoid a potential deadlock

lockdep warns us that priv->lock and k->k_lock can cause a
deadlock when after acquire of k->k_lock, process is interrupted
by src, while in another routine of src .init, k->k_lock is
acquired with priv->lock held.

This patch avoids a potential deadlock by not calling soc_device_match()
in SRC .init callback, instead it adds new soc fields in priv->flags to
differentiate SoCs.

Fixes: linux-next commit 7674bec4fc09 ("ASoC: rsnd: update BSDSR/BSDISR handling")
