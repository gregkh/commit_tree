fuse: Optimize request_end() by not taking fiq->waitq.lock

We take global fiq->waitq.lock every time, when we are in this function,
but interrupted requests are just small subset of all requests. This patch
optimizes request_end() and makes it to take the lock when it's really
needed.

queue_interrupt() needs small change for that. After req is linked to
interrupt list, we do smp_mb() and check for FR_FINISHED again. In case of
FR_FINISHED bit has appeared, we remove req and leave the function:
