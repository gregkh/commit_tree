tools/bpf: silence a libbpf unnecessary warning

Commit 96408c43447a ("tools/bpf: implement libbpf
btf__get_map_kv_tids() API function") refactored
function bpf_map_find_btf_info() and moved bulk of
implementation into btf.c as btf__get_map_kv_tids().
This change introduced a bug such that test_btf will
print out the following warning although the test passed:
  BTF libbpf test[2] (test_btf_nokv.o): libbpf: map:btf_map
      container_name:____btf_map_btf_map cannot be found
      in BTF. Missing BPF_ANNOTATE_KV_PAIR?

Previously, the error message is guarded with pr_debug().
Commit 96408c43447a changed it to pr_warning() and
hence caused the warning.

Restoring to pr_debug() for the message fixed the issue.
