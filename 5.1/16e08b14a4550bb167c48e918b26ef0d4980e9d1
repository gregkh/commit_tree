ext4: cleanup clean_bdev_aliases() calls

Now, we have already handle all cases of forgetting buffer in
jbd2_journal_forget(), the buffer should not be mapped to blockdevice
when reallocating it. So this patch remove all clean_bdev_aliases() and
clean_bdev_bh_alias() calls which were invoked by ext4 explicitly.
