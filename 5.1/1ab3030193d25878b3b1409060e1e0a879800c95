mlxsw: pci: Reincrease PCI reset timeout

During driver initialization the driver sends a reset to the device and
waits for the firmware to signal that it is ready to continue.

Commit d2f372ba0914 ("mlxsw: pci: Increase PCI SW reset timeout")
increased the timeout to 13 seconds due to longer PHY calibration in
Spectrum-2 compared to Spectrum-1.

Recently it became apparent that this timeout is too short and therefore
this patch increases it again to a safer limit that will be reduced in
the future.
