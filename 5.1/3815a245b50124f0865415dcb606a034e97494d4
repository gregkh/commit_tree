security/selinux: fix SECURITY_LSM_NATIVE_LABELS on reused superblock

In the case when we're reusing a superblock, selinux_sb_clone_mnt_opts()
fails to set set_kern_flags, with the result that
nfs_clone_sb_security() incorrectly clears NFS_CAP_SECURITY_LABEL.

The result is that if you mount the same NFS filesystem twice, NFS
security labels are turned off, even if they would work fine if you
mounted the filesystem only once.

("fixes" may be not exactly the right tag, it may be more like
"fixed-other-cases-but-missed-this-one".)
