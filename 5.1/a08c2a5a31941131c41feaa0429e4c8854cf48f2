PM-runtime: Replace jiffies-based accounting with ktime-based accounting

Replace jiffies-based accounting for runtime_active_time and
runtime_suspended_time with ktime-based accounting. This makes the
runtime debug counters inline with genpd and other PM subsytems which
use ktime-based accounting.

Timekeeping is initialized before driver_init(). It's only at that time
that PM-runtime can be enabled.
