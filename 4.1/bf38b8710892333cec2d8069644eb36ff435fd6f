tpm/tpm_i2c_stm_st33: Split tpm_i2c_tpm_st33 in 2 layers (core + phy)

tpm_i2c_stm_st33 is a TIS 1.2 TPM with a core interface which can be used
by different phy such as i2c or spi. The core part is called st33zp24 which
is also the main part reference.

include/linux/platform_data/tpm_stm_st33.h is renamed consequently.
The driver is also split into an i2c phy in charge of sending/receiving
data as well as managing platform data or dts configuration.
