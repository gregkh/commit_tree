crypto: drbg - use single block cipher API

The CTR DRBG only encrypts one single block at a time. Thus, use the
single block crypto API to avoid additional overhead from the block
chaining modes.

With the patch, the speed of the DRBG increases between 30% and 40%.

The DRBG still passes the CTR DRBG CAVS test.
