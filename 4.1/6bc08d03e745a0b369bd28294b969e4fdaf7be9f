powerpc/powernv: handle OPAL_SUCCESS return in opal_sensor_read

Currently, when a sensor value is read, the kernel calls OPAL, which in
turn builds a message for the FSP, and waits for a message back.

The new device tree for OPAL sensors [1] adds new sensors that can be
read synchronously (core temperatures for instance) and that don't need
to wait for a response.

This patch modifies the opal call to accept an OPAL_SUCCESS return value
and cover the case above.
