HID: rmi: disable palm detect gesture when present

A touchpad may have firmware based palm detection code enabled which
suppresses 2D data from being reported when the firmware believes a palm is
on the touchpad. This functionality is meant to be used in mouse mode without
a driver. When a driver is present, the driver can do a better job of
determining if a contact is a palm. If this gesture is enabled on a touchpad
operating in rmi mode then the firmware will not properly clear the palm detect
interrupt, causing the touchpad to interrupt indefinately. This patch disables
the palm detect gesture when the touchpad is operating in rmi mode.
