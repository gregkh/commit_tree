ARM: pxa: pxa_cplds: add lubbock and mainstone IO

Historically, this support was in arch/arm/mach-pxa/lubbock.c and
arch/arm/mach-pxa/mainstone.c. When gpio-pxa was moved to drivers/pxa,
it became a driver, and its initialization and probing happened at
postcore initcall. The lubbock code used to install the chained lubbock
interrupt handler at init_irq() time.

The consequence of the gpio-pxa change is that the installed chained irq
handler lubbock_irq_handler() was overwritten in pxa_gpio_probe(_dt)(),
removing :
 - the handler
 - the falling edge detection setting of GPIO0, which revealed the
   interrupt request from the lubbock IO board.

As a fix, move the gpio0 chained handler setup to a place where we have
the guarantee that pxa_gpio_probe() was called before, so that lubbock
handler becomes the true IRQ chained handler of GPIO0, demuxing the
lubbock IO board interrupts.

This patch moves all that handling to a mfd driver. It's only purpose
for the time being is the interrupt handling, but in the future it
should encompass all the motherboard CPLDs handling :
 - leds
 - switches
 - hexleds

The same logic applies to mainstone board.
