perf tools: Refactor comm/tgid lookup

Rather than parsing /proc/pid/status file one line at a time, read it
into a buffer in one shot and search for all strings in one pass.

tgid conversion also simplified -- removing the isspace walk. As noted
by Arnaldo those are not needed for atoi == strtol calls.
