drm: rcar-du: Handle primary plane config through atomic plane ops

Use the new CRTC atomic transitional helpers drm_helper_crtc_mode_set()
and drm_helper_crtc_mode_set_base() to implement the CRTC .mode_set and
.mode_set_base operations. This delegates primary plane configuration to
the plane .atomic_update and .atomic_disable operations, removing
duplicate code from the CRTC implementation.

There is now no code path available to the driver in which to drop the
reference to the CRTC acquired in the .prepare() operation if an error
then occurs. The driver thus now leaks a reference if an error occurs
during mode set. So be it, this will be fixed in a further step of the
atomic update transition.
