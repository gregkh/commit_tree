um: Remove SKAS3/4 support

Before we had SKAS0 UML had two modes of operation
TT (tracing thread) and SKAS3/4 (separated kernel address space).
TT was known to be insecure and got removed a long time ago.
SKAS3/4 required a few (3 or 4) patches on the host side which never went
mainline. The last host patch is 10 years old.

With SKAS0 mode (separated kernel address space using 0 host patches),
default since 2005, SKAS3/4 is obsolete and can be removed.
