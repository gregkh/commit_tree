vme: tsi148: Master windows support USERx and CR/CSR accesses, not slaves

The tsi148 driver is registering the slave images as supporting the "USER"
access modes and CR/CSR access mode rather than the master images as it
should.

Remove the incorrect case entries for these modes from the
tsi148_slave_set() function, stop registering slave_images as supporting
these modes and instead register master windows as supporting these modes.
