[media] media: New flag V4L2_CTRL_FLAG_EXECUTE_ON_WRITE

Create a new flag that represent controls which its value needs to be
passed to the driver even if it has not changed.

They typically represent actions, like triggering a flash or clearing an
error flag. So writing to such a control means some action is executed.
