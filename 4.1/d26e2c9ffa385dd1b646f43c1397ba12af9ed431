Revert "netfilter: ensure number of counters is >0 in do_replace()"

This partially reverts commit 1086bbe97a07 ("netfilter: ensure number of
counters is >0 in do_replace()") in net/bridge/netfilter/ebtables.c.

Setting rules with ebtables does not work any more with 1086bbe97a07 place.

There is an error message and no rules set in the end.

e.g.

~# ebtables -t nat -A POSTROUTING --src 12:34:56:78:9a:bc -j DROP
Unable to update the kernel. Two possible causes:
1. Multiple ebtables programs were executing simultaneously. The ebtables
   userspace tool doesn't by default support multiple ebtables programs
running

Reverting the ebtables part of 1086bbe97a07 makes this work again.
