MIPS: Loongson-3: Add chipset ACPI platform driver

This add south-bridge (SB700/SB710/SB800 chipset) ACPI platform driver
for Loongson-3. This will be used by EC (Embedded Controller, used by
laptops) driver and STR (Suspend To RAM).

[ralf@linux-mips.org: Fix build error if !CONFIG_CPU_LOONGSON3.  Build
doesn't like it if no obj-* variable is defined at all in a Makefile.
Obviously this has not been tested on other platforms.]
