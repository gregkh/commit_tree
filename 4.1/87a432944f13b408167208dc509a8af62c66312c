staging: rtl8723au: Rework two byte array comparisons

Prior to this commit, rtl8723au's rtw_security.c had two instances of
byte array comparisons (for CRC checks) where the individual elements
of the byte arrays were compared one by one and an error trace would
be output if the byte arrays were determined to be different.

This commit improves the readability of the CRC verification by
placing the individual 4 bytes of each byte array into an 32-bit
unsigned integer and comparing the two resulting integers.

Thanks to Larry Finger for spotting the code style issues in the
previous version of this commit, and thanks to Joe Perches for
suggesting the use of 32-bit integer comparisons instead of byte
array comparisons.
