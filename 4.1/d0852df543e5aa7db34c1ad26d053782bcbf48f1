md/raid5: close race between STRIPE_BIT_DELAY and batching.

When we add a write to a stripe we need to make sure the bitmap
bit is set.  While doing that the stripe is not locked so it could
be added to a batch after which further changes to STRIPE_BIT_DELAY
and ->bm_seq are ineffective.

So we need to hold off adding to a stripe until bitmap_startwrite has
completed at least once, and we need to avoid further changes to
STRIPE_BIT_DELAY once the stripe has been added to a batch.

If a bitmap_startwrite() completes after the stripe was added to a
batch, it will not have set the bit, only incremented a counter, so no
extra delay of the stripe is needed.
