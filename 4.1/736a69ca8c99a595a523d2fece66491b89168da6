drm/i915: Drop PIPE-A quirk for 945GSE HP Mini

Since the introduction of BIOS fb preservation, circa 3.17, we began
encountering a failure during boot when trying to use force-detect
before GEM was initialised. That bug is from

    drm/i915: ensure the force pipe A quirk is actually followed

but investigation of the affected machine revealed that it was using a
PIPE-A quirk even though it was a 945GSE and the quirk is only supposed
to be used to workaround a hardware issue on 830/845. That quirk was
added for this HP Mini in

    add pipe a force quirk for Dell mini

in order to workaround an issue with the BIOS behaving strangely during
lid-close. Since then we have a much larger hammer to thwart the BIOS
after opening the lid and the PIPE-A quirk is no longer required.
