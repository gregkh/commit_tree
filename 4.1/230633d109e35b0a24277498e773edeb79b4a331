kernel/sysctl.c: detect overflows when converting to int

When converting unsigned long to int overflows may occur.  These currently
are not detected when writing to the sysctl file system.

E.g. on a system where int has 32 bits and long has 64 bits
  echo 0x800001234 > /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
has the same effect as
  echo 0x1234 > /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max

The patch adds the missing check in do_proc_dointvec_conv.

With the patch an overflow will result in an error EINVAL when writing to
the the sysctl file system.
