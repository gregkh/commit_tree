power_supply: Move run-time configuration to separate structure

Add new structure 'power_supply_config' for holding run-time
initialization data like of_node, supplies and private driver data.

The power_supply_register() function is changed so all power supply
drivers need updating.

When registering the power supply this new 'power_supply_config' should be
used instead of directly initializing 'struct power_supply'. This allows
changing the ownership of power_supply structure from driver to the
power supply core in next patches.

When a driver does not use of_node or supplies then it should use NULL
as config. If driver uses of_node or supplies then it should allocate
config on stack and initialize it with proper values.
