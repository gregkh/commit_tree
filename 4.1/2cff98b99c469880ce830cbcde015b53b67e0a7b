arm64: add missing PAGE_ALIGN() to __dma_free()

__dma_alloc() does a PAGE_ALIGN() on the passed in size argument before
doing anything else. __dma_free() does not. And because it doesn't, it is
possible to leak memory should size not be an integer multiple of PAGE_SIZE.

The solution is to add a PAGE_ALIGN() to __dma_free() like is done in
__dma_alloc().

Additionally, this patch removes a redundant PAGE_ALIGN() from
__dma_alloc_coherent(), since __dma_alloc_coherent() can only be called
from __dma_alloc(), which already does a PAGE_ALIGN() before the call.
