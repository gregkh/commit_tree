efi: Disable interrupts around EFI calls, not in the epilog/prolog calls

Tapasweni Pathak reported that we do a kmalloc() in efi_call_phys_prolog()
on x86-64 while having interrupts disabled, which is a big no-no, as
kmalloc() can sleep.

Solve this by removing the irq disabling from the prolog/epilog calls
around EFI calls: it's unnecessary, as in this stage we are single
threaded in the boot thread, and we don't ever execute this from
interrupt contexts.
