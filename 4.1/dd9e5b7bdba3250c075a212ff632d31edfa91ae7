KVM: s390: Fix low-address protection for real addresses

The kvm_s390_check_low_addr_protection() function is used only with real
addresses. According to the POP (the "Low-Address Protection"
paragraph in chapter 3), if the effective address is real or absolute,
the low-address protection procedure should raise a PROTECTION exception
only when the low-address protection is enabled in the control register
0 and the address is low.
This patch removes ASCE checks from the function and renames it to
better reflect its behavior.
