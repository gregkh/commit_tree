i40e: Add support for getlink, setlink ndo ops

Add support for bridge offload ndo_ops getlink and setlink to
enable bridge hardware mode as per the mode set via IFLA_BRIDGE_MODE.
The support is only enabled in case of a PF VSI and not available for
any other VSI type.

By default the i40e driver inserts a bridge as part of the bring-up
when a FDIR type VSI and/or a FCoE VSI is created. This bridge is
created in VEB mode by default i.e. after creating the bridge using
"Add VEB" AQ command the loopback for the PF's default VSI is enabled.

The patch adds capability where all the VSIs created as downlink to
the bridge inherits the loopback property and enables loopback only
if the uplink bridge is operating in VEB mode.
Hence, there is no need to explicitly enable loopback as part of
allocating resources for SR-IOV VFs and call to do that has been
removed.

In case a user-request is made either via "bridge" utility or using
the bridge netlink interface that requires to change the hardware
bridge mode then that would require a PF reset and rebuild of the
switch hierarchy.

Also update the copyright year.
