ACPI / SBS: Add 5 us delay to fix SBS hangs on MacBook

Commit 7bc5a2bad0b8 'ACPI: Support _OSI("Darwin") correctly' caused
the MacBook firmware to expose the SBS, resulting in intermittent
hangs of several minutes on boot, and failure to detect or report
the battery.  Fix this by adding a 5 us delay to the start of each
SMBUS transaction.  This timing is the result of experimentation -
hangs were observed with 3 us but never with 5 us.
