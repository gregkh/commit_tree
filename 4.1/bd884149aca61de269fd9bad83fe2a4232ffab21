Input: elantech - fix absolute mode setting on some ASUS laptops

On ASUS TP500LN and X750JN, the touchpad absolute mode is reset each
time set_rate is done.

In order to fix this, we will verify the firmware version, and if it
matches the one in those laptops, the set_rate function is overloaded
with a function elantech_set_rate_restore_reg_07 that performs the
set_rate with the original function, followed by a restore of reg_07
(the register that sets the absolute mode on elantech v4 hardware).

Also the ASUS TP500LN and X750JN firmware version, capabilities, and
button constellation is added to elantech.c
