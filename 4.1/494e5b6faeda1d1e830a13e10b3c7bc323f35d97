sparc: Resolve conflict between sparc v9 and M7 on usage of bit 9 of TTE

Bit 9 of TTE is CV (Cacheable in V-cache) on sparc v9 processor while
the same bit 9 is MCDE (Memory Corruption Detection Enable) on M7
processor. This creates a conflicting usage of the same bit. Kernel
sets TTE.cv bit on all pages for sun4v architecture which works well
for sparc v9 but enables memory corruption detection on M7 processor
which is not the intent. This patch adds code to determine if kernel
is running on M7 processor and takes steps to not enable memory
corruption detection in TTE erroneously.
