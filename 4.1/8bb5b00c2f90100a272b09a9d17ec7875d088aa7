sched: Calculate CPU's usage statistic and put it into struct sg_lb_stats::group_usage

Monitor the usage level of each group of each sched_domain level. The usage is
the portion of cpu_capacity_orig that is currently used on a CPU or group of
CPUs. We use the utilization_load_avg to evaluate the usage level of each
group.

The utilization_load_avg only takes into account the running time of the CFS
tasks on a CPU with a maximum value of SCHED_LOAD_SCALE when the CPU is fully
utilized. Nevertheless, we must cap utilization_load_avg which can be
temporally greater than SCHED_LOAD_SCALE after the migration of a task on this
CPU and until the metrics are stabilized.

The utilization_load_avg is in the range [0..SCHED_LOAD_SCALE] to reflect the
running load on the CPU whereas the available capacity for the CFS task is in
the range [0..cpu_capacity_orig]. In order to test if a CPU is fully utilized
by CFS tasks, we have to scale the utilization in the cpu_capacity_orig range
of the CPU to get the usage of the latter. The usage can then be compared with
the available capacity (ie cpu_capacity) to deduct the usage level of a CPU.

The frequency scaling invariance of the usage is not taken into account in this
patch, it will be solved in another patch which will deal with frequency
scaling invariance on the utilization_load_avg.
