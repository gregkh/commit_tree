ntb: initialize max_mw for Atom before using it

Commit ab760a0 (ntb: Adding split BAR support for Haswell platforms)
changed ntb_device's mw from a fixed-size array into a pointer that is
allocated based on limits.max_mw; however, on Atom platforms, max_mw
is not initialized until ntb_device_setup(), which happens after the
allocation.

Fill out max_mw in ntb_atom_detect() to match ntb_xeon_detect(); this
happens before the use of max_mw in the ndev->mw allocation.

Fixes a null pointer dereference on Atom platforms with ntb hardware.

v2: fix typo (mw_max should be max_mw)
