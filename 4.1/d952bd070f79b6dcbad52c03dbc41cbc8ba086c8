MIPS: KVM: Wire up MSA capability

Now that the code is in place for KVM to support MIPS SIMD Architecutre
(MSA) in MIPS guests, wire up the new KVM_CAP_MIPS_MSA capability.

For backwards compatibility, the capability must be explicitly enabled
in order to detect or make use of MSA from the guest.

The capability is not supported if the hardware supports MSA vector
partitioning, since the extra support cannot be tested yet and it
extends the state that the userland program would have to save.
