spi/rockchip: Add device tree property to configure Rx Sample Delay

We have found that we can sometimes see read failures on boards with
high-capacitance SPI lines. It seems that the controller samples the Rx
data line too early, and its register interface has an "Rx Sample Delay"
setting to fine-tune against this issue.

This patch adds a new optional device tree entry that can configure this
delay in terms of nanoseconds. The kernel will calculate the
best-fitting amount of parent clock ticks to program the controller with
based on that.
