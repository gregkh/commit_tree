[media] vivid: add support to set CVT, GTF timings

In addition to v4l2_find_dv_timings_cap(), where timings are searched
against the list of preset timings, the incoming timing from v4l2-ctl
is checked against CVT and GTF standards. If it confirms to be CVT or
GTF, it is treated as valid timing and vivid format is updated with
new timings.
