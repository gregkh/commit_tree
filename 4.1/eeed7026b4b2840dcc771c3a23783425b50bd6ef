mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: silence a false curly braces warning

Static checkers suggest that probably we intended to put curly braces
around the writel() to make it part of the else path.  But, I think
actually the indenting is off and the code works fine as is.

The stray tab was introduced in 0322191e6298 ('mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: add
sd3.0 SDR clock tuning support')
