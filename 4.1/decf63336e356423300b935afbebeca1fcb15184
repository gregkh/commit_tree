KVM: MMU: fix comment in kvm_mmu_zap_collapsible_spte

Soft mmu uses direct shadow page to fill guest large mapping with small
pages if huge mapping is disallowed on host. So zapping direct shadow
page works well both for soft mmu and hard mmu, it's just less widely
applicable.

Fix the comment to reflect this.
