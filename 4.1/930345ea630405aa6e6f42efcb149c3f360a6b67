netlink: implement nla_put_in_addr and nla_put_in6_addr

IP addresses are often stored in netlink attributes. Add generic functions
to do that.

For nla_put_in_addr, it would be nicer to pass struct in_addr but this is
not used universally throughout the kernel, in way too many places __be32 is
used to store IPv4 address.
