KVM: s390: fix handling of write errors in the tpi handler

If the I/O interrupt could not be written to the guest provided
area (e.g. access exception), a program exception was injected into the
guest but "inti" wasn't freed, therefore resulting in a memory leak.

In addition, the I/O interrupt wasn't reinjected. Therefore the dequeued
interrupt is lost.

This patch fixes the problem while cleaning up the function and making the
cc and rc logic easier to handle.
