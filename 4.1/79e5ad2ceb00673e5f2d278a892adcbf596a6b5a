fib_trie: Remove leaf_info

At this point the leaf_info hash is redundant.  By adding the suffix length
to the fib_alias hash list we no longer have need of leaf_info as we can
determine the prefix length from fa_slen.  So we can compress things by
dropping the leaf_info structure from fib_trie and instead directly connect
the leaves to the fib_alias hash list.
