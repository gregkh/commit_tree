Drivers: hv: vmbus: rename channel work queues

All channel work queues are named 'hv_vmbus_ctl', this makes them
indistinguishable in ps output and makes it hard to link to the corresponding
vmbus device. Rename them to hv_vmbus_ctl/N and make vmbus device names match,
e.g. now vmbus_1 device is served by hv_vmbus_ctl/1 work queue.
