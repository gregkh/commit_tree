x86/mm: Simplify enabling direct_gbpages

direct_gbpages can be force enabled as an early parameter
but not really have taken effect when DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
or KMEMCHECK is enabled. You can also enable direct_gbpages
right now if you have an x86_64 architecture but your CPU
doesn't really have support for this feature. In both cases
PG_LEVEL_1G won't actually be enabled but direct_gbpages is used
in other areas under the assumptions that PG_LEVEL_1G
was set. Fix this by putting together all requirements
which make this feature sensible to enable under, and only
enable both finally flipping on PG_LEVEL_1G and leaving
PG_LEVEL_1G set when this is true.

We only enable this feature then to be possible on sensible
builds defined by the new ENABLE_DIRECT_GBPAGES. If the
CPU has support for it you can either enable this by using
the DIRECT_GBPAGES option or using the early kernel parameter.
If a platform had support for this you can always force disable
it as well.
