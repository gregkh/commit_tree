lib/lz4: Pull out constant tables

There's no reason to allocate the dec{32,64}table on the stack; it
just wastes a bunch of instructions setting them up and, of course,
also consumes quite a bit of stack. Using size_t for such small
integers is a little excessive.

lz4_uncompress_unknownoutputsize             801       -    -801

The now inlined lz4_uncompress functions used to have a stack
footprint of 176 bytes (according to -fstack-usage); their inlinees
have increased their stack use from 32 bytes to 48 and 80 bytes,
respectively.
