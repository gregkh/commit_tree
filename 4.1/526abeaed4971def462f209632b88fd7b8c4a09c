xen: use generated hypercall symbols in arch/x86/xen/xen-head.S

Instead of manually list each hypercall in arch/x86/xen/xen-head.S
use the auto generated symbol list.

This also corrects the wrong address of xen_hypercall_mca which was
located 32 bytes higher than it should.

Symbol addresses have been verified to match the correct ones via
objdump output.
