ARM: kvm: assert on HYP section boundaries not actual code size

Using ASSERT() with an expression that involves a symbol that
is only supplied through a PROVIDE() definition in the linker
script itself is apparently not supported by some older versions
of binutils.

So instead, rewrite the expression so that only the section
boundaries __hyp_idmap_text_start and __hyp_idmap_text_end
are used. Note that this reverts the fix in 06f75a1f6200
("ARM, arm64: kvm: get rid of the bounce page") for the ASSERT()
being triggered erroneously when unrelated linker emitted veneers
happen to end up in the HYP idmap region.
