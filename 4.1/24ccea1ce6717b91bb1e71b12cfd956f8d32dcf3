pwm: mxs: Fix period divider computation

The driver computes which clock divider it sould be using from the
requested period. This computation assumes that the link between the
register value and the actual divider value is raising 2 to the power of
the registry value.

    div = 1 << regvalue

This is true only for the first 5 values out of 8. Next values are 64,
256 and, 1024 - instead of 32, 64, 128.
This affects only the users requesting a period > 0.04369s.

Replace the computation with a look-up table.
