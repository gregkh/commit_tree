net/macb: merge at91_ether driver into macb driver

macb and at91_ether drivers can be compiled as modules, but the at91_ether
driver use some functions and variables defined in the macb one, thus
creating a dependency on the macb driver.

Since these drivers are sharing the same logic we can easily merge
at91_ether into macb.

In order to factorize common probing logic we've added an ->init() function
to struct macb_config (the structure associated with the compatible
string), and moved macb specific init code from macb_probe to macb_init.
