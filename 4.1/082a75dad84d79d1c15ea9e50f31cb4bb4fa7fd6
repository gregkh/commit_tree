rbd: end I/O the entire obj_request on error

When we end I/O struct request with error, we need to pass
obj_request->length as @nr_bytes so that the entire obj_request worth
of bytes is completed.  Otherwise block layer ends up confused and we
trip on

    rbd_assert(more ^ (which == img_request->obj_request_count));

in rbd_img_obj_callback() due to more being true no matter what.  We
already do it in most cases but we are missing some, in particular
those where we don't even get a chance to submit any obj_requests, due
to an early -ENOMEM for example.

A number of obj_request->xferred assignments seem to be redundant but
I haven't touched any of obj_request->xferred stuff to keep this small
and isolated.
