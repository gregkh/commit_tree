device property: Introduce firmware node type for platform data

Introduce data structures and code allowing "built-in" properties
to be associated with devices in such a way that they will be used
by the device_property_* API if no proper firmware node (neither DT
nor ACPI) is present for the given device.

Each property is to be represented by a property_entry structure.
An array of property_entry structures (terminated with a null
entry) can be pointed to by the properties field of struct
property_set that can be added as a firmware node to a struct
device using device_add_property_set().  That will cause the
device_property_* API to use that property_set as the source
of properties if the given device does not have a DT node or
an ACPI companion device object associated with it.
