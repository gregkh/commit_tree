tipc: add ip/udp media type

The ip/udp bearer can be configured in a point-to-point
mode by specifying both local and remote ip/hostname,
or it can be enabled in multicast mode, where links are
established to all tipc nodes that have joined the same
multicast group. The multicast IP address is generated
based on the TIPC network ID, but can be overridden by
using another multicast address as remote ip.
