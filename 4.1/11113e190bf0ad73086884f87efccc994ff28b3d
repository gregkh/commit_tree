netfilter: nf_tables: support different set binding types

Currently a set binding is assumed to be related to a lookup and, in
case of maps, a data load.

In order to use bindings for set updates, the loop detection checks
must be restricted to map operations only. Add a flags member to the
binding struct to hold the set "action" flags such as NFT_SET_MAP,
and perform loop detection based on these.
