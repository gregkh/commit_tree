x86/Kconfig: Simplify X86_UP_APIC handling

We don't really need a helper symbol for that. For one, it's
pointlessly getting set to Y for all configurations (even 64-bit
ones). And then the purpose can be fulfilled by suitably
adjusting X86_UP_APIC: Hide its prompt when PCI_MSI, and default
it to PCI_MSI.
