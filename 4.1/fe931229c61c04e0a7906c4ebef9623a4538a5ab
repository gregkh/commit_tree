ARM: exynos: Fix wake-up interrupts for Exynos3250

Commit 8b283c025443 (ARM: exynos4/5: convert pmu wakeup to
stacked domains) changed the Exynos PMU code to use stacked
domains. This has led to a number of interrupt numbers to be
fixed.

In the meantime, support for Exynos 3250 was added, missing
the required change to this platform. This amounts to revert
ace283a04a4a (ARM: EXYNOS: Fix wrong hwirq of RTC interrupt
for Exynos3250 SoC), as the initial patch was right, just a
bit early...
