Update be2net maintainers' email addresses

Emulex developers' email addresses are now "@avagotech" instead of
"@emulex". I'm also replacing Subbu with Padmanabh and Sriharsha in the
maintainers list. The driver's heading was outdated and did not include
some of the chip types (BE3, Lancer and Skyhawk) that the driver has
been supporting for a longtime. I've updated this too.
