clk: add missing lock when call clk_core_enable in clk_set_parent

Before commit 035a61c314eb ("clk: Make clk API return per-user
struct clk instances") we acquired the enable_lock in
__clk_set_parent_{before,after}() by means of calling
clk_enable(). After commit 035a61c314eb we use clk_core_enable()
in place of the clk_enable(), and clk_core_enable() doesn't
acquire the enable_lock. This opens up a race condition between
clk_set_parent() and clk_enable(). Fix it.
