inet_diag: fix access to tcp cc information

Two different problems are fixed here :

1) inet_sk_diag_fill() might be called without socket lock held.
   icsk->icsk_ca_ops can change under us and module be unloaded.
   -> Access to freed memory.
   Fix this using rcu_read_lock() to prevent module unload.

2) Some TCP Congestion Control modules provide information
   but again this is not safe against icsk->icsk_ca_ops
   change and nla_put() errors were ignored. Some sockets
   could not get the additional info if skb was almost full.

Fix this by returning a status from get_info() handlers and
using rcu protection as well.
