drm/i915: Workaround to avoid lite restore with HEAD==TAIL

WaIdleLiteRestore is an execlists-only workaround, and requires the driver
to ensure that any context always has HEAD!=TAIL when attempting lite
restore.

Add two extra MI_NOOP instructions at the end of each request, but keep
the requests tail pointing before the MI_NOOPs. We may not need to
executed them, and this is why request->tail is sampled before adding
these extra instructions.

If we submit a context to the ELSP which has previously been submitted,
move the tail pointer past the MI_NOOPs. This ensures HEAD!=TAIL.

v2: Move overallocation to gen8_emit_request, and added note about
sampling request->tail in commit message (Chris).

v3: Remove redundant request->tail assignment in __i915_add_request, in
lrc mode this is already set in execlists_context_queue.
Do not add wa implementation details inside gem (Chris).

v4: Apply the wa whenever the req has been resubmitted and update
comment (Chris).
