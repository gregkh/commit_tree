ASoC: Intel: wrap runtime_pm usage count under CONFIG_PM

The struct dev_pm_ops defines usage_count only when CONFIG_PM is defined. So
we should use this variable only in cases where this falg is true.
So we define a local variable and read the value under this flag. In non PM
cases, we set this to 1.
