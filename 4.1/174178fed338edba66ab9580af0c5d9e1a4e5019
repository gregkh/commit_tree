KVM: arm/arm64: add irqfd support

This patch enables irqfd on arm/arm64.

Both irqfd and resamplefd are supported. Injection is implemented
in vgic.c without routing.

This patch enables CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_EVENTFD and CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_IRQFD.

KVM_CAP_IRQFD is now advertised. KVM_CAP_IRQFD_RESAMPLE capability
automatically is advertised as soon as CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_IRQFD is set.

Irqfd injection is restricted to SPI. The rationale behind not
supporting PPI irqfd injection is that any device using a PPI would
be a private-to-the-CPU device (timer for instance), so its state
would have to be context-switched along with the VCPU and would
require in-kernel wiring anyhow. It is not a relevant use case for
irqfds.
