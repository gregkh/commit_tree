xenbus_client: Extend interface to support multi-page ring

Originally Xen PV drivers only use single-page ring to pass along
information. This might limit the throughput between frontend and
backend.

The patch extends Xenbus driver to support multi-page ring, which in
general should improve throughput if ring is the bottleneck. Changes to
various frontend / backend to adapt to the new interface are also
included.

Affected Xen drivers:
* blkfront/back
* netfront/back
* pcifront/back
* scsifront/back
* vtpmfront

The interface is documented, as before, in xenbus_client.c.
