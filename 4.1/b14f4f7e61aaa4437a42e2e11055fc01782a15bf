nfsd: allow setting acls with unenforceable DENYs

We've been refusing ACLs that DENY permissions that we can't effectively
deny.  (For example, we can't deny permission to read attributes.)

Andreas points out that any DENY of Window's "read", "write", or
"modify" permissions would trigger this.  That would be annoying.

So maybe we should be a little less paranoid, and ignore entirely the
permissions that are meaningless to us.
