nfs: do not export discarded symbols

The function nfs4_pnfs_v3_ds_connect_unload is exported so it can be
used by other modules, but is also marked '__exit' and will be
discarded when built into the kernel, as pointed out by this
linker error:

`nfs4_pnfs_v3_ds_connect_unload' referenced in section `___ksymtab_gpl+nfs4_pnfs_v3_ds_connect_unload' of fs/built-in.o: defined in discarded section `.exit.text' of fs/built-in.o

This removes the __exit annotation to make it safe to call this function.
