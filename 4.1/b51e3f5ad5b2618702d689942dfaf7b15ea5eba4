sprd_serial: compile sprd_suspend and sprd_resume conditionally

Building sprd_serial.o when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is not defined triggers
these warnings:
    drivers/tty/serial/sprd_serial.c:755:12: warning: ‘sprd_suspend’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
     static int sprd_suspend(struct device *dev)
                ^
    drivers/tty/serial/sprd_serial.c:764:12: warning: ‘sprd_resume’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
     static int sprd_resume(struct device *dev)
                ^

Let's compile these functions only when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is defined.
