fm10k: corrected VF multicast update

VFs were being improperly added to the switch's multicast group. The
error stems from the fact that incorrect arguments were passed to the
"update_mc_addr" function. It would seem to be a copy paste error since
the parameters are similar to the "update_uc_addr" function.
