UBI: Split __wl_get_peb()

Make it two functions, wl_get_wle() and wl_get_peb().
wl_get_peb() works exactly like __wl_get_peb() but wl_get_wle()
does not call produce_free_peb().
While refilling the fastmap user pool we cannot release ubi->wl_lock
as produce_free_peb() does.
Hence the fastmap logic uses now wl_get_wle().
