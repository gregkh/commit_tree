sched/numa: Avoid some pointless iterations

Commit 81907478c431 ("sched/fair: Avoid using uninitialized variable
in preferred_group_nid()") unconditionally initializes max_group with
NODE_MASK_NONE, this means that when !max_faults (max_group didn't get
set), we'll now continue the iteration with an empty mask.

Which in turn makes the actual body of the loop go away, so we'll just
iterate until completion; short circuit this by breaking out of the
loop as soon as this would happen.
