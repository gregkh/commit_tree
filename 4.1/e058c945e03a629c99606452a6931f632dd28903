drm/i915/hsw: Fix workaround for server AUX channel clock divisor

According to the HSW b-spec we need to try clock divisors of 63
and 72, each 3 or more times, when attempting DP AUX channel
communication on a server chipset.  This actually wasn't happening
due to a short-circuit that only checked the DP_AUX_CH_CTL_DONE bit
in status rather than checking that the operation was done and
that DP_AUX_CH_CTL_TIME_OUT_ERROR was not set.

[v2] Implemented alternate solution suggested by Jani Nikula.
