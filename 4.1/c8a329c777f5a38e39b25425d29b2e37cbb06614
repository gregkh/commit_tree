doc: Add guest_nice column to example output of `cat /proc/stat'

Commit ce0e7b28fb75cb00 ("sched, cpuacct: Fix niced guest time
accounting") added the guest_nice column to /proc/stat, but the example
output of `cat /proc/stat' in Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt wasn't
updated accordingly. Do so now.
