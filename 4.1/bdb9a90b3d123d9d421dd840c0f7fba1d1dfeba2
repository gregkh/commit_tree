mmc: dw_mmc: fix mmc_test by not sending abort for DRTO/EBE errors

The STOP command can terminate a data transfer between a memory card and
mmc controller.

As show in Synopsys DesignWare Cores Mobile Storage Host Databook:
Data timeout and Data end-bit error will terminate further data transfer
by mmc controller. So we should not send abort command to terminate a
data transfer again if we got DRTO and EBE interrupt.

After this patch, all mmc_test cases can pass on RK3288-Pink2 board.
