perf/x86/intel/pt: Clean up the control flow in pt_pmu_hw_init()

Dan Carpenter pointed out that the control flow in pt_pmu_hw_init()
is a bit messy: for example the kfree(de_attrs) is entirely
superfluous.

Another problem is the inconsistent mixing of label based and
direct return error handling.

Add modern, label based error handling instead and clean up the code
a bit as well.

Note that we'll still do a kfree(NULL) in the normal case - this does
not matter as this is an init path and kfree() returns early if it
sees a NULL.
