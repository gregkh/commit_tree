clockevents: Cleanup dead cpu explicitely

clockevents_notify() is a leftover from the early design of the
clockevents facility. It's really not a notification mechanism,
it's a multiplex call. We are way better off to have explicit
calls instead of this monstrosity.

Split out the cleanup function for a dead cpu and invoke it
directly from the cpu down code. Make it conditional on
CPU_HOTPLUG as well.

Temporary change, will be refined in the future.
