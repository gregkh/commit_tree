fs: don't allow to complete sync iocbs through aio_complete

The AIO interface is fairly complex because it tries to allow
filesystems to always work async and then wakeup a synchronous
caller through aio_complete.  It turns out that basically no one
was doing this to avoid the complexity and context switches,
and we've already fixed up the remaining users and can now
get rid of this case.
