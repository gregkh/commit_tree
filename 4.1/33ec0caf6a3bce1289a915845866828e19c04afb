perf tools: Add the bash completion for listing subsubcommands of perf timechart

The bash completion does not support listing subsubcommands for 'perf
timechart <TAB>', so fix it.

Example:

Before this patch:

 $ perf timechart <TAB>
 $

As shown above, the subsubcommands of perf timechart does not come out.

After this patch:

 $ perf timechart <TAB>
 record

As shown above, the subsubcommands of perf timechart can come out now.
