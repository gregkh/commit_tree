usb: gadget: printer: enqueue printer's response for setup request

Function-specific setup requests should be handled in such a way, that
apart from filling in the data buffer, the requests are also actually
enqueued: if function-specific setup is called from composte_setup(),
the "usb_ep_queue()" block of code in composite_setup() is skipped.

The printer function lacks this part and it results in e.g. get device id
requests failing: the host expects some response, the device prepares it
but does not equeue it for sending to the host, so the host finally asserts
timeout.

This patch adds enqueueing the prepared responses.
