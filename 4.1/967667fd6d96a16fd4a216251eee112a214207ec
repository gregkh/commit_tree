drm/plane-helper: Fixup mismerge

I somehow manage to screw up applying Laurent's patch in eca93e28c256:
"drm: Check in setcrtc if the primary plane supports the fb pixel
format". It was a conflict with

commit 3461b30b3e171e16498f3d7bc59ab703aec475c8

    drm/plane-helper: unexport drm_primary_helper_create_plane

and I just didn't check that the solution from wiggle made sense.
