kasan: Makefile: shut up warnings if CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST=y

It might be annoying to constantly see this:

	scripts/Makefile.kasan:16: Cannot use CONFIG_KASAN: -fsanitize=kernel-address is not supported by compiler

while performing allmodconfig/allyesconfig build tests.
Disable this warning if CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST=y.
