md-cluster: remove capabilities

This adds "remove" capabilities for the clustered environment.
When a user initiates removal of a device from the array, a
REMOVE message with disk number in the array is sent to all
the nodes which kick the respective device in their own array.

This facilitates the removal of failed devices.
