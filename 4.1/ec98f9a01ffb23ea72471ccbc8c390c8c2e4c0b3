MIPS: math-emu: Update sNaN quieting handlers

Commit fdffbafb [Lots of FPU bug fixes from Kjeld Borch Egevang.]
replaced the two single `ieee754sp_nanxcpt' and `ieee754dp_nanxcpt'
places, where sNaN quieting used to happen for single and double
floating-point operations respectively, with individual qNaN
instantiations across all the call sites instead.  It also made most of
these two functions dead code as where called on a qNaN they return
right away.

To revert the damage and make sNaN quieting uniform again first rewrite
`ieee754sp_nanxcpt' and `ieee754dp_nanxcpt' to do the same quieting all
the call sites do, that is return the default qNaN encoding for all
input sNaN values; never propagate any sNaN payload bits from its
trailing significand field.
