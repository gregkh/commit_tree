nfs: Fetch MOUNTED_ON_FILEID when updating an inode

2ef47eb1 (NFS: Fix use of nfs_attr_use_mounted_on_fileid()) was a good
start to fixing a circular directory structure warning for NFS v4
"junctioned" mountpoints.  Unfortunately, further testing continued to
generate this error.

My server is configured like this:

anna@nfsd ~ % df
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/vda1       9.1G  2.0G  6.5G  24% /
/dev/vdc1      1014M   33M  982M   4% /exports
/dev/vdc2      1014M   33M  982M   4% /exports/vol1
/dev/vdc3      1014M   33M  982M   4% /exports/vol1/vol2

anna@nfsd ~ % cat /etc/exports
/exports/          *(rw,async,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)
/exports/vol1/     *(rw,async,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)
/exports/vol1/vol2 *(rw,async,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)

I've been running chown across the entire mountpoint twice in a row to
hit this problem.  The first run succeeds, but the second one fails with
the circular directory warning along with:

anna@client ~ % dmesg
[Apr 3 14:28] NFS: server 192.168.100.204 error: fileid changed
              fsid 0:39: expected fileid 0x100080, got 0x80

WHere 0x80 is the mountpoint's fileid and 0x100080 is the mounted-on
fileid.

This patch fixes the issue by requesting an updated mounted-on fileid
from the server during nfs_update_inode(), and then checking that the
fileid stored in the nfs_inode matches either the fileid or mounted-on
fileid returned by the server.
