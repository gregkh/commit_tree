drm/omap: fix race condition with dev->obj_list

omap_gem_objects are added to dev->obj_list in omap_gem_new, and removed
in omap_gem_free_object. Unfortunately there's no locking for
dev->obj_list, which eventually leads to a crash:

WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1123 at lib/list_debug.c:59 __list_del_entry+0xa4/0xe0()
list_del corruption. prev->next should be e9281344, but was ea722b84

Add a spinlock to protect dev->obj_list.
