compal-laptop: Fix leaking hwmon device

The commit c2be45f09bb0 ("compal-laptop: Use
devm_hwmon_device_register_with_groups") wanted to change the
registering of hwmon device to resource-managed version. It mostly did
it except the main thing - it forgot to use devm-like function so the
hwmon device leaked after device removal or probe failure.
