xen/netback: Properly initialize credit_bytes

Commit e9ce7cb6b107 ("xen-netback: Factor queue-specific data into queue
struct") introduced a regression when moving queue-specific data into
the queue struct by failing to set the credit_bytes field. This
prevented bandwidth limiting from working. Initialize the field as it
was done before multiqueue support was added.
