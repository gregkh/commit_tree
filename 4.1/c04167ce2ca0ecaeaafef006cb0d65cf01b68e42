ebpf: add helper for obtaining current processor id

This patch adds the possibility to obtain raw_smp_processor_id() in
eBPF. Currently, this is only possible in classic BPF where commit
da2033c28226 ("filter: add SKF_AD_RXHASH and SKF_AD_CPU") has added
facilities for this.

Perhaps most importantly, this would also allow us to track per CPU
statistics with eBPF maps, or to implement a poor-man's per CPU data
structure through eBPF maps.

Example function proto-type looks like:

  u32 (*smp_processor_id)(void) = (void *)BPF_FUNC_get_smp_processor_id;
