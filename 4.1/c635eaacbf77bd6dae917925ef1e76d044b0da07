amd-xgbe: Remove Tx coalescing

The Tx coalescing support in the driver was a software implementation
for something lacking in the hardware. Using hrtimers, the idea was to
trigger a timer interrupt after having queued a packet for transmit.
Unfortunately, as the timer value was lowered, the timer expired before
the hardware actually did the transmit and so it was racey and resulted
in unnecessary interrupts.

Remove the Tx coalescing support and hrtimer and replace with a Tx timer
that is used as a reclaim timer in case of inactivity.
