mm: don't call __page_cache_release for hugetlb

__put_compound_page() calls __page_cache_release() to do some freeing
work, but it's obviously for thps, not for hugetlb.  We don't care because
PageLRU is always cleared and page->mem_cgroup is always NULL for hugetlb.
But it's not correct and has potential risks, so let's make it
conditional.
