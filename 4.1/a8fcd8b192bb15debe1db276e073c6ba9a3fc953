arm64: Enable CONFIG_COMPAT also for 64k page size

With binutils 2.25 the default alignment for 32bit arm sections changed to
have everything 64k aligned. Armv7 binaries built with this binutils version
run successfully on an arm64 system.

Since effectively there is now the chance to run armv7 code on arm64 even
with 64k page size, it doesn't make sense to block people from enabling
CONFIG_COMPAT on those configurations.
