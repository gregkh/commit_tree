Bluetooth: Add workaround for broken OS X legacy SMP pairing

OS X version 10.10.2 (and possibly older versions) doesn't support LE
Secure Connections but incorrectly copies all authentication request
bits from a Security Request to its Pairing Request. The result is that
an SC capable initiator (such as BlueZ) will think OS X intends to do SC
when in fact it's incapable of it:

< ACL Data TX: Handle 3585 flags 0x00 dlen 6
      SMP: Security Request (0x0b) len 1
        Authentication requirement: Bonding, No MITM, SC, No Keypresses (0x09)
> ACL Data RX: Handle 3585 flags 0x02 dlen 11
      SMP: Pairing Request (0x01) len 6
        IO capability: KeyboardDisplay (0x04)
        OOB data: Authentication data not present (0x00)
        Authentication requirement: Bonding, No MITM, SC, No Keypresses (0x09)
        Max encryption key size: 16
        Initiator key distribution: EncKey (0x01)
        Responder key distribution: EncKey IdKey Sign (0x07)
< ACL Data TX: Handle 3585 flags 0x00 dlen 11
      SMP: Pairing Response (0x02) len 6
        IO capability: NoInputNoOutput (0x03)
        OOB data: Authentication data not present (0x00)
        Authentication requirement: Bonding, No MITM, SC, No Keypresses (0x09)
        Max encryption key size: 16
        Initiator key distribution: EncKey (0x01)
        Responder key distribution: EncKey Sign (0x05)

The pairing eventually fails when we get an unexpected Pairing Confirm
PDU instead of a Public Key PDU:

> ACL Data RX: Handle 3585 flags 0x02 dlen 21
      SMP: Pairing Confirm (0x03) len 16
        Confim value: bcc3bed31b8f313a78ec3cce32685faf

It is only at this point that we can speculate that the remote doesn't
really support SC. This patch creates a workaround for the just-works
model, however the MITM case is unsolvable because the OS X user has
already been requested to enter a PIN which we're now expected to
randomly generate and show the user (i.e. a chicken-and-egg problem).
