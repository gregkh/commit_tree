sched: Remove frequency scaling from cpu_capacity

Now that arch_scale_cpu_capacity has been introduced to scale the original
capacity, the arch_scale_freq_capacity is no longer used (it was
previously used by ARM arch).

Remove arch_scale_freq_capacity from the computation of cpu_capacity.
The frequency invariance will be handled in the load tracking and not in
the CPU capacity. arch_scale_freq_capacity will be revisited for scaling
load with the current frequency of the CPUs in a later patch.
