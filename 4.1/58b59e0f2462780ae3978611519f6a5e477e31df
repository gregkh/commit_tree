i2c: pca954x: improve usage of gpiod API

Since 39b2bbe3d715 (gpio: add flags argument to gpiod_get*() functions)
which appeared in v3.17-rc1, the gpiod_get* functions take an additional
parameter that allows to specify direction and initial value for
outputs.

Also there is an *_optional variant that serves well here.  The sematics
is slightly changed here by using it. Now if a reset gpio is specified
and getting hold on it fails, pca954x_probe fails, too.
