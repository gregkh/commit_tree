tools/power turbostat: Use $(CURDIR) instead of $(PWD) and add support for O= option in Makefile

Since commit ee0778a30153
("tools/power: turbostat: make Makefile a bit more capable")
turbostat's Makefile is using

  [...]
  BUILD_OUTPUT    := $(PWD)
  [...]

which obviously causes trouble when building "turbostat" with

  make -C /usr/src/linux/tools/power/x86/turbostat ARCH=x86 turbostat

because GNU make does not update nor guarantee that $PWD is set.

This patch changes the Makefile to use $CURDIR instead, which GNU make
guarantees to set and update (i.e. when using "make -C ...") and also
adds support for the O= option (see "make help" in your root of your
kernel source tree for more details).
