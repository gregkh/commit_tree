ASoC: simple-card: Remove support for setting differing DAI formats

Having to set different formats on the CPU side and the CODEC side of a DAI
link is usually indication that something is terribly wrong and in most
cases is a result of a broken driver that implements a set_fmt() callback
which does not follow the specification. In the past this feature has been
used to work around broken drivers, rather than fixing them. We don't really
want to encourage this, so remove support for setting different formats on
both ends of the link.

Along the way switch to static DAI format setup by setting the the dai_fmt
field of the snd_soc_dai_link rather than calling snd_soc_dai_fmt().
