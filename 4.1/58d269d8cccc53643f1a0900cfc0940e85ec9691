KVM: x86: BSP in MSR_IA32_APICBASE is writable

After reset, the CPU can change the BSP, which will be used upon INIT.  Reset
should return the BSP which QEMU asked for, and therefore handled accordingly.

To quote: "If the MP protocol has completed and a BSP is chosen, subsequent
INITs (either to a specific processor or system wide) do not cause the MP
protocol to be repeated."
