MAINTAINERS: replace an AT91 maintainer

As some help is needed from an active maintainer, replace Andrew Victor
by Alexandre Belloni in the ARM/Atmel MAINTAINERS' entry (aka AT91).
Add an entry to the CREDITS file.

Thanks Andrew for the great role you played during the early days of this
product family.
