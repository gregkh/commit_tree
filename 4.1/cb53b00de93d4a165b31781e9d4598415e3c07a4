staging: ft1000: ft1000-usb: adjust function arguments

Handles the following issues:

Removing extra parentheses around function arguments,
Removing unnecessary pointer to pointer cast.

Issues were detected using the following coccinelle script:

@@
expression e;
type t;
identifier f;
@@

f(...,
-(t *)
e
,...)

@@
expression e;
identifier f;
@@

f(...,
&
-(
e
-)
,...)

@@
expression e;
identifier f;
@@

f(...,
-(
e
-)
,...)

Parentheses removal were left to the script. However, handling pointer
casts were done manually because not all replacements generated by the
script were suitable. In general, the following cases were discarded:

pointer casts in macros,
pointer casts on function arguments in the form of:
    <func>(...,(<type> *)&<expression>,...)

since both cases generated compilation warnings.
