MIPS: KVM: Handle TRAP exceptions from guest kernel

Trap instructions are used by Linux to implement BUG_ON(), however KVM
doesn't pass trap exceptions on to the guest if they occur in guest
kernel mode, instead triggering an internal error "Exception Code: 13,
not yet handled". The guest kernel then doesn't get a chance to print
the usual BUG message and stack trace.

Implement handling of the trap exception so that it gets passed to the
guest and the user is left with a more useful log message.
