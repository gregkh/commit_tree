drm/i915: FIFO space query code refactor

When querying the GTFIFOCTL register to check the FIFO space, the read value
must be masked. The operation is repeated explicitly in several places. This
change refactors the read-and-mask code into a function call.

v2: rebased on top of Mika's forcewake patch set, specifically:
	[PATCH 8/8] drm/i915: Enum forcewake domains and domain identifiers
