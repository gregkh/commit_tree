xfs: make xfs_cross_rename() complete fully

Now that xfs_finish_rename() exists, there is no reason for
xfs_cross_rename() to return to xfs_rename() to finish off the
rename transaction. Drive the completion code into
xfs_cross_rename() and handle all errors there so as to simplify
the xfs_rename() code.

Further, push the rename exchange target_ip check to early in the
rename code so as to make the error handling easy and obviously
correct.
