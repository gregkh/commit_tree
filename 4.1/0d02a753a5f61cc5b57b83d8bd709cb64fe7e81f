selftests/timers: Add set-2038 test from timetest suite

Adds the set-2038 test which sets the time to near-edge cases
like the start and end of the 32 bit epoch and checks that
time behaves properly. There is also a dangerous mode, which
lets the clock roll over past 2038 on 32bit systems, which
on some older kernels will cause system hangs.
