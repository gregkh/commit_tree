usb: gadget: atmel_usba_udc: Request an auto disabled Vbus signal IRQ

Vbus IRQ handler needs a started UDC driver to work because it uses
udc->driver, which is set by the UDC start handler. The previous way
chosen was to return from interrupt if udc->driver is NULL using a
spinlock around the check.

We now request an auto disabled (IRQ_NOAUTOEN) Vbus signal IRQ instead
of an auto enabled IRQ followed by disable_irq(). This way we remove the
very small timeslot of enabled IRQ which existed previously between
request() and disable(). We don't need anymore to check if udc->driver
is NULL in IRQ handler.
