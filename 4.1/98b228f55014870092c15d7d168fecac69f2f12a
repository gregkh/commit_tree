x86/efi: Store upper bits of command line buffer address in ext_cmd_line_ptr

Until now, the EFI stub was only setting the 32 bit cmd_line_ptr in
the setup_header structure, so on 64 bit platforms this could be truncated.
This patch adds setting the upper bits of the buffer address in
ext_cmd_line_ptr.  This case was likely never hit, as the allocation
for this buffer is done at the lowest available address.  Only
x86_64 kernels have this problem, as the 1-1 mapping mandated
by EFI ensures that all memory is 32 bit addressable on 32 bit
platforms.  The EFI stub does not support mixed mode, so the
32 bit kernel on 64 bit firmware case does not need to be handled.
