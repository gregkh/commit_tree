x86/asm/decoder: Fix and enforce max instruction size in the insn decoder

x86 instructions cannot exceed 15 bytes, and the instruction
decoder should enforce that.  Prior to 6ba48ff46f76, the
instruction length limit was implicitly set to 16, which was an
approximation of 15, but there is currently no limit at all.

Fix MAX_INSN_SIZE (it should be 15, not 16), and fix the decoder
to reject instructions that exceed MAX_INSN_SIZE.

Other than potentially confusing some of the decoder sanity
checks, I'm not aware of any actual problems that omitting this
check would cause, nor am I aware of any practical problems
caused by the MAX_INSN_SIZE error.
