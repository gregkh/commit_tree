bus: omap_l3_noc: Fix offset for DRA7 CLK1_HOST_CLK1_2 instance

The base address for DRA7 CLK1_HOST_CLK1_2 host instance is
0x44800000, so correct offset is 0x800000. DRA7 TRM rev X(fewb 2015)
has updates for this information.

With wrong offset these errors are not correctly cleared by the L3
IRQ handler and cause an continuous interrupt scenario and system lockup.
