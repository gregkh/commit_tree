mfd: max77693: Adjust FLASH_EN_SHIFT and TORCH_EN_SHIFT macros

Modify FLASH_EN_SHIFT and TORCH_EN_SHIFT macros to work properly
when passed enum max77693_fled values (0 for FLED1 and 1 for FLED2)
from leds-max77693 driver. Previous definitions were compatible with
one of the previous RFC versions of leds-max77693.c driver, which was
not merged.
