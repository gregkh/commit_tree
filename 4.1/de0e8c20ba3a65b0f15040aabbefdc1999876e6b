xfs: use i_mmaplock on read faults

Take the i_mmaplock over read page faults. These come through the
->fault callout, so we need to wrap the generic implementation
with the i_mmaplock. While there, add tracepoints for the read
fault as it passes through XFS.

This gives us a lock order of mmap_sem -> i_mmaplock -> page_lock
-> i_lock.
