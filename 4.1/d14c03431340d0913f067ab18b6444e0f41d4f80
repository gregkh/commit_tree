drm/i915/skl: Restore pipe interrupt registers after power well enabling

The pipe interrupt registers are in the actual pipe power well, so we
need to restore them when re-enable the corresponding power well.

I've also copied what we do on HSW/BDW for VGA, even if the we haven't
enabled unclaimed registers just yet.

v2: Don't run skl_power_well_post_enable() if the power well is already
    enabled (Paulo)
