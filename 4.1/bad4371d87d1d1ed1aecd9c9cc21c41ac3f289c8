mmc: sh_mmcif: Fix timeout value for command request

f9fd54f22e ("mmc: sh_mmcif: Use msecs_to_jiffies() for host->timeout")
changed the timeout value from 1000 jiffies to 1s. In the case where
HZ is 1000 the values are the same. However, for smaller HZ values the
timeout is now smaller, 1s instead of 10s in the case of HZ=100.

Since the timeout occurs in spite of a normal data transfer a timeout of
10s seems more appropriate. This restores the previous timeout in the
case where HZ=100 and results in an increase over the previous timeout
for larger values of HZ.
