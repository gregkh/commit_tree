mmc: tmio: mmc: tmio: tmio_mmc_data has .chan_priv_?x

dma_request_slave_channel_compat() in tmio_mmc_dma
needs .chan_priv_tx/.chan_priv_rx. But these are copied from
sh_mobile_sdhi only, and sh_mobile_sdhi_info is now almost
same as tmio_mmc_data except .chan_priv_?x.
sh_mobile_sdhi_info can be replaced to tmio_mmc_data, but it is
used from ${LINUX}/arch/arm/mach-shmobile, ${LINUX}/arch/sh.
So, this patch adds .chan_priv_?x into tmio_mmc_data as 1st step,
and sh_mobile_sdhi driver has dummy operation for now.
It will be replaced/removed together with platform data replace.
