ACPICA: iASL: Enhancement for constant folding.

ACPICA commit 4f9e950d41cd6f6c704d5d6cf518647620d65e99

Add support to fold expressions with a target operand -- these are
folded and converted to a Store operator:

Add (4, 3, INT1) --> Store (7, INT1)

Also supports ASL+ constructs:

INT1 = 4 + 3 --> Store (7, INT1)

Linux kernel is not affected by this patch.
