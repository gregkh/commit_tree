platform: x86: dell-laptop: Add support for keyboard backlight

This patch adds the support for the configuration of the keyboard
backlight on supported Dell laptops.

With this patch it is possible to set:
* keyboard backlight level
* timeout after which the backlight will be automatically turned off
* input activity triggers (keyboard, touchpad, mouse) that enable the backlight
* ambient light settings

The settings are exposed via /sys/class/leds/dell::kbd_backlight/

The code is based on the newly released documentation by Dell in the
libsmbios project.
