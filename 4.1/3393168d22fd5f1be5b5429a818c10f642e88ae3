btrfs: qgroup: Fix dead judgement on qgroup_rescan_leaf() return value.

Old qgroup_rescan_leaf() comment indicates ret == 2 as complete and
cleared INCONSISTENT flag.

This is not true since it will never return 2, and inside it no codes
will clear INCONSISTENT flag.
The flag clearance is done in btrfs_qgroup_rescan_work().
This caused the bug that INCONSISTENT flag is never cleared.

So change the comment and fix the dead judgment.
