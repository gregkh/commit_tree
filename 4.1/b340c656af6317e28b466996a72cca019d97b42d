tile: support arch_irq_work_raise

Tile includes a hypervisor hook to deliver messages to arbitrary
tiles, so we can use that to raise an interrupt as soon as
possible on our own core.  Unfortunately the Tilera hypervisor
disabled that support on principle in previous releases, but
it will be available in MDE 4.3.4 and later.
