[media] coda: Add tracing support

This patch adds tracepoints to the coda driver that can be used together
with the v4l2:v4l2_qbuf and v4l2:v4l2_dqbuf tracepoints to to follow video
frames through the mem2mem device.

For encoding with the BIT processor:
    coda:coda_enc_pic_run
    coda:coda_enc_pic_done

For decoding with the BIT processor:
    coda:coda_bit_queue
    coda:coda_dec_pic_run
    coda:coda_dec_pic_done
    coda:coda_dec_rot_done

Additionally, two low level tracepoints register whenever the BIT processor
is started and returns:
    coda:coda_bit_run
    coda:coda_bit_done
