md: don't require sync_min to be a multiple of chunk_size.

There is really no need for sync_min to be a multiple of
chunk_size, and values read from here often aren't.
That means you cannot read a value and expect to be able
to write it back later.

So remove the chunk_size check, and round down to a multiple
of 4K, to be sure everything works with 4K-sector devices.
