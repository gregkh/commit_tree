UBI: power cut emulation for testing

Emulate random power cuts by switching device to ro after a number of
writes to allow simple power cut testing with nand-sim.

Maximum and minimum number of successful writes before power cut and
what kind of writes (EC header, VID header or none) to interrupt
configurable via debugfs.
