score: Fix exception handler label

The latest version of modinfo fails to compile score architecture
targets with the following error.

FATAL: The relocation at __ex_table+0x634 references
section "__ex_table" which is not executable, IOW
the kernel will fault if it ever tries to
jump to it.  Something is seriously wrong
and should be fixed.

The probem is caused by a bad label in an __ex_table entry.
