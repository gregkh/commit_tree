net/macb: only probe queues once and use stored values

When merging at91_ether and macb driver during 421d9df0628b (net/macb: merge
at91_ether driver into macb driver) the probe function has been split. The code
dealing with initialization of queues is now moved in macb_init() which needs
information computed in the parent macb_probe() function.
So, add the queue_mask information to the private structure and use it when
needed in macb_init().
