iwlwifi: mvm: rs: adapt rate matching to new STBC/BFER

Once the FW supports autonomous decision between STBC/BFER/SISO
we no longer set the STBC bit and ANT_AB in the rate table.
However the FW rate in the tx response will have the STBC
or BFER bit set and the antennas set to ANT_AB in case these
were chosen by it. This will cause us to discard any such
response as unmatching the current LQ table and thus break
the rs search cycle completely.
Fix this by relaxing the rate matching in case we're working
with the new API and STBC/BFER are used.
