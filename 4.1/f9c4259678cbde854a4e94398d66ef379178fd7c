aacraid: IOCTL fix

After getting the platform shutdown command "VM_CloseAll" response from the
firmware, driver was getting configuration IOCTL request from the upper layers
and it sends down to firmware. This causes firmware assert issue.

This patch fixes the firmware assert issue. During the shutdown, if driver
gets commands from the upper layer, driver sends error code to the upper
layers.
