ASoC: n810: Consistently pass the card DAPM context to n810_ext_control()

Some callers of n810_ext_control() pass the card DAPM context and some pass
the CODEC DAPM context. Given that some of the widgets that are accessed in
the function are in the card's context, always passing it is the obvious
choice.
