mpls: Fix the openvswitch select of NET_MPLS_GSO

Fix the OPENVSWITCH Kconfig option and old Kconfigs by having
OPENVSWITCH select both NET_MPLS_GSO and MPLSO.

A Kbuild test robot reported that when NET_MPLS_GSO is selected by
OPENVSWITCH the generated .config is broken because MPLS is not
selected.
