fib_trie: Address possible NULL pointer dereference in resize

If the inflate call failed it would return NULL.  As a result tp would be
set to NULL and cause use to trigger a NULL pointer dereference in
should_halve if the inflate failed on the first attempt.

In order to prevent this we should decrement max_work before we actually
attempt to inflate as this will force us to exit before attempting to halve
a node we should have inflated.  In order to keep things symmetric between
inflate and halve I went ahead and also moved the decrement of max_work for
the halve case as well so we take care of that before we actually attempt
to halve the tnode.
