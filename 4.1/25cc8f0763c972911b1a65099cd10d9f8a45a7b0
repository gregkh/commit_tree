mpls: fix possible use after free of device

The mpls device is used in an RCU read context without a lock being
held. As the memory is freed without waiting for the RCU grace period
to elapse, the freed memory could still be in use.

Address this by using kfree_rcu to free the memory for the mpls device
after the RCU grace period has elapsed.
