Add new disk to clustered array

Algorithm:
1. Node 1 issues mdadm --manage /dev/mdX --add /dev/sdYY which issues
   ioctl(ADD_NEW_DISC with disc.state set to MD_DISK_CLUSTER_ADD)
2. Node 1 sends NEWDISK with uuid and slot number
3. Other nodes issue kobject_uevent_env with uuid and slot number
(Steps 4,5 could be a udev rule)
4. In userspace, the node searches for the disk, perhaps
   using blkid -t SUB_UUID=""
5. Other nodes issue either of the following depending on whether the disk
   was found:
   ioctl(ADD_NEW_DISK with disc.state set to MD_DISK_CANDIDATE and
	 disc.number set to slot number)
   ioctl(CLUSTERED_DISK_NACK)
6. Other nodes drop lock on no-new-devs (CR) if device is found
7. Node 1 attempts EX lock on no-new-devs
8. If node 1 gets the lock, it sends METADATA_UPDATED after unmarking the disk
   as SpareLocal
9. If not (get no-new-dev lock), it fails the operation and sends METADATA_UPDATED
10. Other nodes understand if the device is added or not by reading the superblock again after receiving the METADATA_UPDATED message.
