rhashtable: provide len to obj_hashfn

nftables sets will be converted to use so called setextensions, moving
the key to a non-fixed position. To hash it, the obj_hashfn must be used,
however it so far doesn't receive the length parameter.

Pass the key length to obj_hashfn() and convert existing users.
