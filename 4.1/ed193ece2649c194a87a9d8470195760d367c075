tipc: simplify link mtu negotiation

When a link is being established, the two endpoints advertise their
respective interface MTU in the transmitted RESET and ACTIVATE messages.
If there is any difference, the lower of the two MTUs will be selected
for use by both endpoints.

However, as a remnant of earlier attempts to introduce TIPC level
routing. there also exists an MTU discovery mechanism. If an intermediate
node has a lower MTU than the two endpoints, they will discover this
through a bisectional approach, and finally adopt this MTU for common use.

Since there is no TIPC level routing, and probably never will be,
this mechanism doesn't make any sense, and only serves to make the
link level protocol unecessarily complex.

In this commit, we eliminate the MTU discovery algorithm,and fall back
to the simple MTU advertising approach. This change is fully backwards
compatible.
