[media] siano: register media controller earlier

We need to initialize the media controller earlier, as the core
will call the smsdvb hotplug during register time. Ok, this is
an async operation, so, when the module is not loaded, the media
controller works.

However, if the module is already loaded, nothing will be
registered at the media controller, as it will load too late.
