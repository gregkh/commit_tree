ARM: OMAP4+: PRM: add support for passing status register/bit info to reset

AM43xx has slightly different reset register layout compared to OMAP4+,
with varying status bit shifts and status register offsets. Current
code assumes static offsets and identical status / reset control bit
shifts, which is wrong. This patch adds PRM core support for passing
the actual implementations from hwmod code. AM43xx mappings will be fixed
in subsequent patch.
