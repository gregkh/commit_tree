staging/lustre/mdc: Handle empty but non-zero acl xattr

We have found that posix_acl_access can have a value
of \002\000\000\000.  In that case body->aclsize is
non-zero, but the there are no actuall acls stored
in the xattr.

In mdc_unpack_acl(), it only checks IS_ERR() on the
pointer returned by posix_acl_from_xattr(), it does not
check for NULL.  Because of the above situation, the
xattr aclsize can be non-zero, but posic_acl_from_xattr()
still returns NULL.  Passing NULL to posix_acl_valid()
crashes the kernel.

We add a check to properly handle the NULL return value.
