perf tools: Improve Python feature detection messages

Change the Python detection message from:

  config/Makefile:566: No python-config tool was found
  config/Makefile:566: Python support will not be built

  config/Makefile:565: No 'python-config' tool was found: disables Python support - please install python-devel/python-dev

It's now a standard one-line message with a package install suggestion,
and it also uses the standard language used by other feature detection
messages.
