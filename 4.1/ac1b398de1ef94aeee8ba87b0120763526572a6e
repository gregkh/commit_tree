kernel/fork.c: avoid division by zero

PAGE_SIZE is not guaranteed to be equal to or less than 8 times the
THREAD_SIZE.

E.g.  architecture hexagon may have page size 1M and thread size 4096.
This would lead to a division by zero in the calculation of max_threads.

With 32-bit calculation there is no solution which delivers valid results
for all possible combinations of the parameters.  The code is only called
once.  Hence a 64-bit calculation can be used as solution.
