mpls: Allow mpls_gso and mpls_router to be built as modules

CONFIG_MPLS=m doesn't result in a kernel module being built because it
applies to the net/mpls directory, rather than to .o files.

So revert the MPLS menuitem to being a boolean and make MPLS_GSO and
MPLS_ROUTING tristates to allow mpls_gso and mpls_router modules to be
produced as desired.
