nfs: stat(2) fails during cthon04 basic test5 on NFSv4.0

When running the Connectathon basic tests against a Solaris NFS
server over NFSv4.0, test5 reports that stat(2) returns a file size
of zero instead of 1MB.

On success, nfs_commit_inode() can return a positive result; see
other call sites such as nfs_file_fsync_commit() and
nfs_commit_unstable_pages().

The call site recently added in nfs_wb_all() does not prevent that
positive return value from leaking to its callers. If it leaks
through nfs_sync_inode() back to nfs_getattr(), that causes stat(2)
to return a positive return value to user space while also not
filling in the passed-in struct stat.

Additional clean up: the new logic in nfs_wb_all() is rewritten in
bfields-normal form.
