UBI: Fastmap: Ensure that only one fastmap work is scheduled

If the WL pool runs out of PEBs we schedule a fastmap write
to refill it as soon as possible.
Ensure that only one at a time is scheduled otherwise we might end in
a fastmap write storm because writing the fastmap can schedule another
write if bitflips are detected.
