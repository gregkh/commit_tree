mmc: sh_mmcif: Move dev_err() of mmcif_timeout_work()

If interruption of command already occurred, mrq pointer in dev_err()
would refer to NULL, because the host-state is changed to STATE_IDLE
and mrq pointer is changed to NULL by interrupt handler.
Therefore dev_err is moved after checking STATE_IDLE.
