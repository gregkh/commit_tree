MIPS: Respect the ISA level in FCSR handling

Define the central place the default FCSR value is set from, initialised
in `cpu_probe'.  Determine the FCSR mask applied to values written to
the register with CTC1 in the full emulation mode and via ptrace(2),
according to the ISA level of processor hardware or the writability of
bits 31:18 if actual FPU hardware is used.

Software may rely on FCSR bits whose functions our emulator does not
implement, so it should not allow them to be set or software may get
confused.  For ptrace(2) it's just sanity.
