target/user: Only support full command pass-through

After much discussion, give up on only passing a subset of SCSI commands
to userspace and pass them all. Based on what pscsi is doing, make sure
to set SCF_SCSI_DATA_CDB for I/O ops, and define attributes identical to
pscsi.

Make hw_block_size configurable via dev param.

Remove mention of command filtering from tcmu-design.txt.
