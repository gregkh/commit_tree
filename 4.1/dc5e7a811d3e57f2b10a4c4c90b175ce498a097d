xen: netback: fix printf format string warning

drivers/net/xen-netback/netback.c: In function ‘xenvif_tx_build_gops’:
drivers/net/xen-netback/netback.c:1253:8: warning: format ‘%lu’ expects argument of type ‘long unsigned int’, but argument 5 has type ‘int’ [-Wformat=]
        (txreq.offset&~PAGE_MASK) + txreq.size);
        ^

PAGE_MASK's type can vary by arch, so a cast is needed.

----
v2: Cast to unsigned long, since PAGE_MASK can vary by arch.
