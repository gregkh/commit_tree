oprofile: reduce mmap_sem hold for mm->exe_file

sync_buffer() needs the mmap_sem for two distinct operations, both only
occurring upon user context switch handling:

 1) Dealing with the exe_file.

 2) Adding the dcookie data as we need to lookup the vma that
   backs it. This is done via add_sample() and add_data().

This patch isolates 1), for it will no longer need the mmap_sem for
serialization.  However, for now, make of the more standard
get_mm_exe_file(), requiring only holding the mmap_sem to read the value,
and relying on reference counting to make sure that the exe file won't
dissappear underneath us while doing the get dcookie.

As a consequence, for 2) we move the mmap_sem locking into where we really
need it, in lookup_dcookie().  The benefits are twofold: reduce mmap_sem
hold times, and cleaner code.
