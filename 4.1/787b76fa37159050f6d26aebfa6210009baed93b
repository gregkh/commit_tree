md/raid5: call break_stripe_batch_list from handle_stripe_clean_event

Now that the code in break_stripe_batch_list() is nearly identical
to the end of handle_stripe_clean_event, replace the later
with a function call.

The only remaining difference of any interest is the masking that is
applieds to dev[i].flags copied from head_sh.
R5_WriteError certainly isn't wanted as it is set per-stripe, not
per-patch.  R5_Overlap isn't wanted as it is explicitly handled.
