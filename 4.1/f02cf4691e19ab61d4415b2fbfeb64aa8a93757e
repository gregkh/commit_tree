MIPS: DEC: Implement FPU interrupt counter

Implement a cheap way to count FPU interrupts for R2k/R3k DECstation
systems.  Do this manually in handcoded assembly, rather than calling
`kstat_incr_irq_this_cpu' that would require setting up a stack frame
and a lot of redirection.  This is not going to be a problem because the
FPU interrupt is local to the CPU and also there is one CPU only anyway.

So at bootstrap determine the address of the correct location within
`struct irq_desc', and then only refer to it directly in the interrupt
handler.
