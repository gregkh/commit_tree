workqueue: Reorder sysfs code

The sysfs code usually belongs to the botom of the file since it deals
with high level objects. In the workqueue code it's misplaced and such
that we'll need to work around functions references to allow the sysfs
code to call APIs like apply_workqueue_attrs().

Lets move that block further in the file, almost the botom.

And declare workqueue_sysfs_unregister() just before destroy_workqueue()
which reference it.

tj: Moved workqueue_sysfs_unregister() forward declaration where other
    forward declarations are.
