serial: 8250_early: Remove early_device variable

early_device was only required for serial8250_find_port_for_earlycon(),
which was replaced by extensible console matching.

Fixup early_serial8250_write() to get the earlycon_device * from
console->data (which is initialized by {of_}setup_earlycon()).
