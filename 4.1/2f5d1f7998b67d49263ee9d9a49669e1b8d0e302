aacraid: IOCTL pass-through command fix

The Linux aacriad driver fails to detect the case of SG list count=0 on IOCTL
pass-through command and cause intermittent fault.  The result is the Linux
aacriad driver send down IOCTL pass-through command with one not initialized
SG list to firmware when receiving SG list count =0 on pass-through command.
