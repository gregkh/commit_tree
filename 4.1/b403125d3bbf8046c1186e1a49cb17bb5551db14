ARM: rockchip: fix undefined instruction of reset_ctrl_regs

Sometimes the debug module may not work well after resume, since it has
not been correctly reset when wakeup from suspend. That cause system
crash during reusme, and a 'undefined instruction' is displayed on the
console. Set the GRF_FORCE_JTAG bit of RK3288_GRF_SOC_CON0 can ensure
that debug modul is reset. And we can change the value of
RK3288_GRF_SOC_CON0 back when system resume.

According to discussions, there does not seem a better solution available.
Please also see the potential security implication described in the
comment inline in the code.
