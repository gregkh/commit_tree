i2c: slave: rework the slave API

After more discussion, brave users, and additional datasheet evaluation,
some API updates for the new I2C slave framework became imminent. The
slave events now get some easier to understand naming. Also, the event
handling has been simplified to only need a single call to the slave
callback when an action by the backend is required.
