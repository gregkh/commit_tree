ARM64 / ACPI: Introduce ACPI_IRQ_MODEL_GIC and register device's gsi

Introduce ACPI_IRQ_MODEL_GIC which is needed for ARM64 as GIC is
used, and then register device's gsi with the core IRQ subsystem.

acpi_register_gsi() is similar to DT based irq_of_parse_and_map(),
since gsi is unique in the system, so use hwirq number directly
for the mapping.

We are going to implement stacked domains when GICv2m, GICv3, ITS
support are added.
