arm64: add macros for common adrp usages

The adrp instruction is mostly used in combination with either
an add, a ldr or a str instruction with the low bits of the
referenced symbol in the 12-bit immediate of the followup
instruction.

Introduce the macros adr_l, ldr_l and str_l that encapsulate
these common patterns.
