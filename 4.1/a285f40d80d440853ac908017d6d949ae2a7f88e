usb: gadget: net2280: use ep_autoconfig compatible names in advance mode

Each struct usb_ep added for net2280 can be used in either direction.
Whereas, each struct usb_ep for usb3380 has fixed direction. Use
ep_autoconf compatible names so that endpoint with correct direction
can be selected.

Name sequence is due to the logic in usb_reinit_338x() in ne[] and
ep_reg_addr[].
