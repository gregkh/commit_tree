kselftests: timers: Make set-timer-lat fail more gracefully for !CAP_WAKE_ALARM

The set-timer-lat test fails when testing CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM
or CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM when the user isn't running as root or
with CAP_WAKE_ALARM.

So this patch improves the error checking so we report the
issue more clearly and continue rather then reporting a failure.
