drm/exynos: track vblank events on a per crtc basis

The goal of the change is to make sure we send the vblank event on the
current vblank. My hope is to fix any races that might be causing flicker.
After this change I only see a flicker in the transition plymouth and
X11.

Simplified the code by tracking vblank events on a per-crtc basis. This
allowed me to remove all error paths from the callback. It also allowed
me to remove the vblank wait from the callback.
