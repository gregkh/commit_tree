fib_trie: Add slen to fib alias

Make use of an empty spot in the alias to store the suffix length so that
we don't need to pull that information from the leaf_info structure.

This patch also makes a slight change to the user statistics.  Instead of
incrementing semantic_match_miss once per leaf_info miss we now just
increment it once per leaf if a match was not found.
