thinkpad_acpi: Revert unintentional device attribute renaming

The conversion to DEVICE_ATTR_* macros failed to fixup a few cases where
the old attribute names didn't match the show/store function names.
Instead of renaming the functions, the attributes were renamed. This
caused an unintentional API change.  The hwmon required 'name' attribute
were among the renamed attribute, causing libsensors to fail to detect
the hwmon device at all.

Fix by using the DEVICE_ATTR macro for these attributes, allowing the
show/store functions to keep their system specific prefixes.
