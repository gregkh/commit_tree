doc: add information about max_ptes_none

max_ptes_none specifies how many extra small pages (that are
not already mapped) can be allocated when collapsing a group
of small pages into one large page.

/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/max_ptes_none

A higher value leads to use additional memory for programs.
A lower value leads to gain less thp performance. Value of
max_ptes_none can waste cpu time very little, you can
ignore it.
