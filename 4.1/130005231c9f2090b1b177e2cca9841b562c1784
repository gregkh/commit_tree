kvm: mmu: don't do memslot overflow check

As Andres pointed out:

| I don't understand the value of this check here. Are we looking for a
| broken memslot? Shouldn't this be a BUG_ON? Is this the place to care
| about these things? npages is capped to KVM_MEM_MAX_NR_PAGES, i.e.
| 2^31. A 64 bit overflow would be caused by a gigantic gfn_start which
| would be trouble in many other ways.

This patch drops the memslot overflow check to make the codes more simple.
