KVM: x86: Fix re-execution of patched vmmcall

For a very long time (since 2b3d2a20), the path handling a vmmcall
instruction of the guest on an Intel host only applied the patch but no
longer handled the hypercall. The reverse case, vmcall on AMD hosts, is
fine. As both em_vmcall and em_vmmcall actually have to do the same, we
can fix the issue by consolidating both into the same handler.
