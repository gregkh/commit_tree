jhash: Update jhash_[321]words functions to use correct initval

Looking over the implementation for jhash2 and comparing it to jhash_3words
I realized that the two hashes were in fact very different.  Doing a bit of
digging led me to "The new jhash implementation" in which lookup2 was
supposed to have been replaced with lookup3.

In reviewing the patch I noticed that jhash2 had originally initialized a
and b to JHASH_GOLDENRATIO and c to initval, but after the patch a, b, and
c were initialized to initval + (length << 2) + JHASH_INITVAL.  However the
changes in jhash_3words simply replaced the initialization of a and b with
JHASH_INITVAL.

This change corrects what I believe was an oversight so that a, b, and c in
jhash_3words all have the same value added consisting of initval + (length
<< 2) + JHASH_INITVAL so that jhash2 and jhash_3words will now produce the
same hash result given the same inputs.
