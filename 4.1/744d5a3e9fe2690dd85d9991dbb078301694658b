net: move skb->dropcount to skb->cb[]

Commit 977750076d98 ("af_packet: add interframe drop cmsg (v6)")
unionized skb->mark and skb->dropcount in order to allow recording
of the socket drop count while maintaining struct sk_buff size.

skb->dropcount was introduced since there was no available room
in skb->cb[] in packet sockets. However, its introduction led to
the inability to export skb->mark, or any other aliased field to
userspace if so desired.

Moving the dropcount metric to skb->cb[] eliminates this problem
at the expense of 4 bytes less in skb->cb[] for protocol families
using it.
