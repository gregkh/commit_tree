HID: hid-sensor-hub: Fix debug lock warning

When CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC is defined, mutex magic is compared and
warned for (l->magic != l), here l is the address of mutex pointer.
In hid-sensor-hub as part of hsdev creation, a per hsdev mutex is
initialized during MFD cell creation. This hsdev, which contains, mutex
is part of platform data for the a cell. But platform_data is copied
in platform_device_add_data() in platform.c. This copy will copy the
whole hsdev structure including mutex. But once copied the magic
will no longer match. So when client driver call
sensor_hub_input_attr_get_raw_value, this will trigger mutex warning.
So to avoid this allocate mutex dynamically. This will be same even
after copy.
