mm, numa: really disable NUMA balancing by default on single node machines

NUMA balancing is meant to be disabled by default on UMA machines but
the check is using nr_node_ids (highest node) instead of
num_online_nodes (online nodes).

The consequences are that a UMA machine with a node ID of 1 or higher
will enable NUMA balancing.  This will incur useless overhead due to
minor faults with the impact depending on the workload.  These are the
impact on the stats when running a kernel build on a single node machine
whose node ID happened to be 1:

  			       vanilla     patched
  NUMA base PTE updates          5113158           0
  NUMA huge PMD updates              643           0
  NUMA page range updates        5442374           0
  NUMA hint faults               2109622           0
  NUMA hint local faults         2109622           0
  NUMA hint local percent            100         100
  NUMA pages migrated                  0           0
