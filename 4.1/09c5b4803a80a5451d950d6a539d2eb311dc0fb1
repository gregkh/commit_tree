libata: Ignore spurious PHY event on LPM policy change

When the LPM policy is set to ATA_LPM_MAX_POWER, the device might
generate a spurious PHY event that cuases errors on the link.
Ignore this event if it occured within 10s after the policy change.

The timeout was chosen observing that on a Dell XPS13 9333 these
spurious events can occur up to roughly 6s after the policy change.
