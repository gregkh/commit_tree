xfs: DIO writes within EOF don't need an ioend

DIO writes that lie entirely within EOF have nothing to do in IO
completion. In this case, we don't need no steekin' ioend, and so we
can avoid allocating an ioend until we have a mapping that spans
EOF.

This means that IO completion has two contexts - deferred completion
to the dio workqueue that uses an ioend, and interrupt completion
that does nothing because there is nothing that can be done in this
context.
