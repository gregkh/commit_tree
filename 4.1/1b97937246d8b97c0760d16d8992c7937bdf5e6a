ARM: fix missing syscall trace exit

Josh Stone reports:

  I've discovered a case where both arm and arm64 will miss a ptrace
  syscall-exit that they should report.  If the syscall is entered
  without TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE set, then it goes on the fast path.  It's
  then possible to have TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE added in the middle of the
  syscall, but ret_fast_syscall doesn't check this flag again.

Fix this by always checking for a syscall trace in the fast exit path.
