dt-bindings: brcm: rationalize Broadcom documentation naming

This patchset attempts to standardize the naming of dt-bindings
documents based on the Broadcom vendor prefix of brcm.

Although there are no guidelines currently present for how to name
the dt-bindings document the "vendor,binding.txt" style is in use by
some of the other vendors.
