bus: mvebu-mbus: do not set WIN_CTRL_SYNCBARRIER on non io-coherent platforms.

Commit a0b5cd4ac2d6 ("bus: mvebu-mbus: use automatic I/O
synchronization barriers") enabled the usage of automatic I/O
synchronization barriers by enabling bit WIN_CTRL_SYNCBARRIER in the
control registers of MBus windows, but on non io-coherent platforms
(orion5x, kirkwood and dove) the WIN_CTRL_SYNCBARRIER bit in
the window control register is either reserved (all windows except 6
and 7) or enables read-only protection (windows 6 and 7).
