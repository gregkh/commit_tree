perf: Make perf_cgroup_from_task() global

Move perf_cgroup_from_task() from kernel/events/ to include/linux/ along
with the necessary struct definitions, so that it can be used by the PMU
code.

When the upcoming Intel Cache Monitoring PMU driver assigns monitoring
IDs to perf events, it needs to be able to check whether any two
monitoring events overlap (say, a cgroup and task event), which means we
need to be able to lookup the cgroup associated with a task (if any).
