net_sched: gred: use correct backlog value in WRED mode

In WRED mode, the backlog for a single virtual queue (VQ) should not be
used to determine queue behavior; instead the backlog is summed across
all VQs. This sum is currently used when calculating the average queue
lengths. It also needs to be used when determining if the queue's hard
limit has been reached, or when reporting each VQ's backlog via netlink.
q->backlog will only be used if the queue switches out of WRED mode.
