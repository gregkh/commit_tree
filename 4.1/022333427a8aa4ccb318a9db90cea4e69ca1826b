dm: optimize dm_mq_queue_rq to _not_ use kthread if using pure blk-mq

dm_mq_queue_rq() is in atomic context so care must be taken to not
sleep -- as such GFP_ATOMIC is used for the md->bs bioset allocations
and dm-mpath's call to blk_get_request().  In the future the bioset
allocations will hopefully go away (by removing support for partial
completions of bios in a cloned request).

Also prepare for supporting DM blk-mq ontop of old-style request_fn
device(s) if a new dm-mod 'use_blk_mq' parameter is set.  The kthread
will still be used to queue work if blk-mq is used ontop of old-style
request_fn device(s).
