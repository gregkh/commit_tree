drivers/rtc/interface.c: __rtc_read_time: reduce log level

__rtc_read_time logs should be debug logs instead of error logs.

For example, when the RTC clock is not set, it's not really useful
to print a kernel error log every time someone tries to read the clock:

	~ # hwclock -r
	[  604.508263] rtc rtc0: read_time: fail to read
	hwclock: RTC_RD_TIME: Invalid argument

If there's a real error, it's likely that lower level or higher level
code will tell it anyway. Make these logs debug logs, and also print
the error code for the read failure.
