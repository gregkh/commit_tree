perf: Always switch pmu specific data during context switch

If two tasks were both forked from the same parent task, Events in
their perf task contexts can be the same. Perf core may leave out
switching the perf event contexts.

Previous patch inroduces pmu specific data. The data is for saving
the LBR stack, it is task specific. So we need to switch the data
even when context switch is optimized out.
