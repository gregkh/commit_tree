drm/i915: Don't skip request retirement if the active list is empty

Apparently we can have requests even if though the active list is empty,
so do the request retirement regardless of whether there's anything
on the active list.

The way it happened here is that during suspend intel_ring_idle()
notices the olr hanging around and then proceeds to get rid of it by
adding a request. However since there was nothing on the active lists
i915_gem_retire_requests() didn't clean those up, and so the idle work
never runs, and we leave the GPU "busy" during suspend resulting in a
WARN later.
