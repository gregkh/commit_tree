ARM: S3C64XX: Use fixed IRQ bases to avoid conflicts on Cragganmore

There are two PMICs on Cragganmore, currently one dynamically assign
its IRQ base and the other uses a fixed base. It is possible for the
statically assigned PMIC to fail if its IRQ is taken by the dynamically
assigned one. Fix this by statically assigning both the IRQ bases.
