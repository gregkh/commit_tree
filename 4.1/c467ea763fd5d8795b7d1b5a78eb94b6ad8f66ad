context_tracking: Rename context symbols to prepare for transition state

Current context tracking symbols are designed to express living state.
As such they are prefixed with "IN_": IN_USER, IN_KERNEL.

Now we are going to use these symbols to also express state transitions
such as context_tracking_enter(IN_USER) or context_tracking_exit(IN_USER).
But while the "IN_" prefix works well to express entering a context, it's
confusing to depict a context exit: context_tracking_exit(IN_USER)
could mean two things:
	1) We are exiting the current context to enter user context.
	2) We are exiting the user context
We want 2) but the reviewer may be confused and understand 1)

So lets disambiguate these symbols and rename them to CONTEXT_USER and
CONTEXT_KERNEL.
