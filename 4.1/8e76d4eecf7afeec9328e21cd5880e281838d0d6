sched, numa: do not hint for NUMA balancing on VM_MIXEDMAP mappings

Jovi Zhangwei reported the following problem

  Below kernel vm bug can be triggered by tcpdump which mmaped a lot of pages
  with GFP_COMP flag.

  [Mon May 25 05:29:33 2015] page:ffffea0015414000 count:66 mapcount:1 mapping:          (null) index:0x0
  [Mon May 25 05:29:33 2015] flags: 0x20047580004000(head)
  [Mon May 25 05:29:33 2015] page dumped because: VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(compound_order(page) && !PageTransHuge(page))
  [Mon May 25 05:29:33 2015] ------------[ cut here ]------------
  [Mon May 25 05:29:33 2015] kernel BUG at mm/migrate.c:1661!
  [Mon May 25 05:29:33 2015] invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP

In this case it was triggered by running tcpdump but it's not necessary
reproducible on all systems.

  sudo tcpdump -i bond0.100 'tcp port 4242' -c 100000000000 -w 4242.pcap

Compound pages cannot be migrated and it was not expected that such pages
be marked for NUMA balancing.  This did not take into account that drivers
such as net/packet/af_packet.c may insert compound pages into userspace
with vm_insert_page.  This patch tells the NUMA balancing protection
scanner to skip all VM_MIXEDMAP mappings which avoids the possibility that
compound pages are marked for migration.
