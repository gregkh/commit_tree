arm64: Extract feature parsing code from cpu_errata.c

As we detect more architectural features at runtime, it makes
sense to reuse the existing framework whilst avoiding to call
a feature an erratum...

This patch extract the core capability parsing, moves it into
a new file (cpufeature.c), and let the CPU errata detection code
use it.
