MIPS: Changed current_thread_info() to an equivalent supported by both clang and GCC

Without this, a 'break' instruction is executed very early in the boot and
the boot hangs.

The problem is that clang doesn't honour named registers on local variables
and silently treats them as normal uninitialized variables. However, it
does honour them on global variables.
