ipv6: fix ECMP route replacement

When replacing an IPv6 multipath route with "ip route replace", i.e.
NLM_F_CREATE | NLM_F_REPLACE, fib6_add_rt2node() replaces only first
matching route without fixing its siblings, resulting in corrupted
siblings linked list; removing one of the siblings can then end in an
infinite loop.

IPv6 ECMP implementation is a bit different from IPv4 so that route
replacement cannot work in exactly the same way. This should be a
reasonable approximation:

1. If the new route is ECMP-able and there is a matching ECMP-able one
already, replace it and all its siblings (if any).

2. If the new route is ECMP-able and no matching ECMP-able route exists,
replace first matching non-ECMP-able (if any) or just add the new one.

3. If the new route is not ECMP-able, replace first matching
non-ECMP-able route (if any) or add the new route.

We also need to remove the NLM_F_REPLACE flag after replacing old
route(s) by first nexthop of an ECMP route so that each subsequent
nexthop does not replace previous one.
