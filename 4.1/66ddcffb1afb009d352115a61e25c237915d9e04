i40e: Fix RSS size at init since default num queue calculation has changed

With changes to default number of queue pairs that the interface comes up with
from 1 per online CPU to 1 per lan_msix, we need to make sure we recalculate
rss_size. We will now recalculate rss_size based on number of queues enabled in
the VSI.

Without this fix if the max_lan_msix < num_online_cpu we will be coming up
with fewer queues but will be populating rss_size based on num_online_cpus.
This will result in packets getting silently dropped because RSS LUT has queues
that are not enabled.
