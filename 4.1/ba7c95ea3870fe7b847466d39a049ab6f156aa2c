rhashtable: Fix sleeping inside RCU critical section in walk_stop

The commit 963ecbd41a1026d99ec7537c050867428c397b89 ("rhashtable:
Fix use-after-free in rhashtable_walk_stop") fixed a real bug
but created another one because we may end up sleeping inside an
RCU critical section.

This patch fixes it properly by replacing the mutex with a spin
lock that specifically protects the walker lists.
