proc: show locks in /proc/pid/fdinfo/X

Let's show locks which are associated with a file descriptor in
its fdinfo file.

Currently we don't have a reliable way to determine who holds a lock.  We
can find some information in /proc/locks, but PID which is reported there
can be wrong.  For example, a process takes a lock, then forks a child and
dies.  In this case /proc/locks contains the parent pid, which can be
reused by another process.

$ cat /proc/locks
...
6: FLOCK  ADVISORY  WRITE 324 00:13:13431 0 EOF
...

$ ps -C rpcbind
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
  332 ?        00:00:00 rpcbind

$ cat /proc/332/fdinfo/4
pos:	0
flags:	0100000
mnt_id:	22
lock:	1: FLOCK  ADVISORY  WRITE 324 00:13:13431 0 EOF

$ ls -l /proc/332/fd/4
lr-x------ 1 root root 64 Mar  5 14:43 /proc/332/fd/4 -> /run/rpcbind.lock

$ ls -l /proc/324/fd/
total 0
lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Feb 27 14:50 0 -> /dev/pts/0
lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Feb 27 14:50 1 -> /dev/pts/0
lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Feb 27 14:49 2 -> /dev/pts/0

You can see that the process with the 324 pid doesn't hold the lock.

This information is required for proper dumping and restoring file
locks.
