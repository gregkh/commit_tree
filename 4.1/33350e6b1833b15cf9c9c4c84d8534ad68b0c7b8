Mailbox: Restructure and simplify PCC mailbox code

Previously the PCC driver depended on the client
side to map the communication space base address. This region
was was then used in the PCC driver and the client side.
The client side used this region to read and write its data
and the PCC driver used it to only write the PCC command.
Removing this split simplifies the PCC driver a lot. This patch
moves all communication region read/writes to the client side.
The PCC clients can now drive the PCC mailbox controller via the
mbox_client_txdone() method.
