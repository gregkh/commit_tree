mpls: Add a sysctl to control the size of the mpls label table

This sysctl gives two benefits.  By defaulting the table size to 0
mpls even when compiled in and enabled defaults to not forwarding
any packets.  This prevents unpleasant surprises for users.

The other benefit is that as mpls labels are allocated locally a dense
table a small dense label table may be used which saves memory and
is extremely simple and efficient to implement.

This sysctl allows userspace to choose the restrictions on the label
table size userspace applications need to cope with.
