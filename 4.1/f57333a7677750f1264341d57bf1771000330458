powerpc/powernv: Fix return value from power7_nap() et al.

The power7_nap(), power7_sleep() and power7_winkle() functions are
called from pnv_smp_cpu_kill_self(), which expects them to return the
SRR1 value set by the hardware on wakeup, or 0 if no nap/sleep/winkle
occurred.  However, in the case where an interrupt needs to be
replayed, the logic in power7_powersave_common (the common code for
power7_nap et al.) doesn't set r3 to 0 in this case.  Instead what we
get as the return value is the selector for the type of power-saving
mode requested (1, 2 or 3).  In fact this should not affect the
operation of pnv_smp_cpu_kill_self(), but it is better to get this
correct, so this adds an instruction to set r3 to 0 in this case.
