tcp: add tcpi_bytes_acked to tcp_info

This patch tracks total number of bytes acked for a TCP socket.
This is the sum of all changes done to tp->snd_una, and allows
for precise tracking of delivered data.

RFC4898 named this : tcpEStatsAppHCThruOctetsAcked

This is a 64bit field, and can be fetched both from TCP_INFO
getsockopt() if one has a handle on a TCP socket, or from inet_diag
netlink facility (iproute2/ss patch will follow)

Note that tp->bytes_acked was placed near tp->snd_una for
best data locality and minimal performance impact.
