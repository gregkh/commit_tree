net: core: add of_find_net_device_by_node()

Add a helper function which allows getting the struct net_device pointer
associated with a given struct device_node pointer. This is useful for
instance for DSA Ethernet devices not backed by a platform_device, but a PCI
device.

Since we need to access net_class which is not accessible outside of
net/core/net-sysfs.c, this helper function is also added here and gated
with CONFIG_OF_NET.

Network devices initialized with SET_NETDEV_DEV() are also taken into
account by checking for dev->parent first and then falling back to
checking the device pointer within struct net_device.
