net/9p/tracing: Export enums in tracepoints to userspace

The tracepoints in the 9p code use a lot of enums for the __print_symbolic()
function. These enums are shown in the tracepoint format files, and user
space tools such as trace-cmd does not have the information to parse it.
Add helper macros to export the enums with TRACE_DEFINE_ENUM().
