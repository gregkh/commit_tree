perf probe: Warn if given uprobe event accesses memory on older kernel

Warn if given uprobe event accesses memory on older kernel.

Until 3.14, uprobe event only supports accessing registers so this warns
to upgrade kernel if uprobe-event returns -EINVAL and an argument of the
event accesses memory ($stack, @+offset, and +|-offs() symtax).

With this patch (on 3.10.0-123.13.2.el7.x86_64);
  -----
  # ./perf probe -x ./perf warn_uprobe_event_compat stack=-0\(%sp\)
  Added new event:
  Failed to write event: Invalid argument
  Please upgrade your kernel to at least 3.14 to have access to feature -0(%sp)
    Error: Failed to add events.
