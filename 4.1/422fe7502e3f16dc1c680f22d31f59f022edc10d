timers/PM: Fix up tick_unfreeze()

A recent conflict resolution has left tick_resume() in
tick_unfreeze() which leads to an unbalanced execution of
tick_resume_broadcast() every time that function runs.

Fix that by replacing the tick_resume() in tick_unfreeze()
with tick_resume_local() as appropriate.
