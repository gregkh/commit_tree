serial: 8250_pci: port failed after wakeup from S3

Serial ports of F81504/F81508/F81512 will failed when wakeup from S3(STR).

It's due to when the system wakeup from S3(STR), this PCI device's
configuration space from 0x40 to 0x40 + max_port * 0x08 should be
re-configured.

We move all initialization from pci_fintek_setup() to pci_fintek_init() and
set it to pci_serial_quirks .init section. It's will re-init this device when
system wakeup from pciserial_resume_ports().
