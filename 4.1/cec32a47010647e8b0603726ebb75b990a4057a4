media-bus: Fixup RGB444_1X12, RGB565_1X16, and YUV8_1X24 media bus format

Change the constant values for RGB444_1X12, RGB565_1X16, and YUV8_1X24 media
bus formats in anticipation of a merge conflict with the media tree, where
the old values are already taken by RBG888_1X24, RGB888_1X32_PADHI, and
VUY8_1X24, respectively.
