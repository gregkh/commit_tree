module: Call module notifier on failure after complete_formation()

The module notifier call chain for MODULE_STATE_COMING was moved up before
the parsing of args, into the complete_formation() call. But if the module failed
to load after that, the notifier call chain for MODULE_STATE_GOING was
never called and that prevented the users of those call chains from
cleaning up anything that was allocated.
