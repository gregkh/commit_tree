f2fs: support fast lookup in extent cache

This patch adds a fast lookup path for rb-tree extent cache.

In this patch we add a recently accessed extent node pointer 'cached_en' in
extent tree. In lookup path of extent cache, we will firstly lookup the last
accessed extent node which cached_en points, if we do not hit in this node,
we will try to lookup extent node in rb-tree.

By this way we can avoid unnecessary slow lookup in rb-tree sometimes.

Note that, side-effect of this patch is that we will increase memory cost,
because we will store a pointer variable in each struct extent tree
additionally.
