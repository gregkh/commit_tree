perf/x86/intel: Add Broadwell core support

Add Broadwell support for Broadwell to perf.

The basic support is very similar to Haswell. We use the new cache
event list added for Haswell earlier. The only differences
are a few bits related to remote nodes. To avoid an extra,
mostly identical, table these are patched up in the initialization code.

The constraint list has one new event that needs to be handled over Haswell.

Includes code and testing from Kan Liang.
