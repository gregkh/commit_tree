mnt: On an unmount propagate clearing of MNT_LOCKED

A prerequisite of calling umount_tree is that the point where the tree
is mounted at is valid to unmount.

If we are propagating the effect of the unmount clear MNT_LOCKED in
every instance where the same filesystem is mounted on the same
mountpoint in the mount tree, as we know (by virtue of the fact
that umount_tree was called) that it is safe to reveal what
is at that mountpoint.
