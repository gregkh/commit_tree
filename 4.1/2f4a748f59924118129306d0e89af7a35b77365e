staging: ft1000: ft1000-usb: ft1000_hw.c: adjust function arguments

Handles the following issues:

Removing extra parentheses around function arguments,
Removing unnecessary pointer to pointer casts.

Issues were detected using the following coccinelle script:

@@
expression e;
type t;
identifier f;
@@

f(...,
-(t *)
e
,...)

@@
expression e;
identifier f;
@@

f(...,
&
-(
e
-)
,...)

@@
expression e;
identifier f;
@@

f(...,
-(
e
-)
,...)

Parentheses removal were left to the script. However, there were some
cases that were handled manually. In addition, handling pointer casts
were done manually too because not all replacements generated by the
script were suitable. When pointer casts on function arguments were
in the form:
    <func>(...,(<type> *)&<expression>,...)

the replacements were discarded due to compilation warnings.
