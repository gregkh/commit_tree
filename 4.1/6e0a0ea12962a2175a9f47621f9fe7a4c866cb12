ACPI / sleep: Introduce CONFIG_ACPI_SYSTEM_POWER_STATES_SUPPORT

ACPI 5.1 does not currently support S states for ARM64 hardware but
ACPI code will call acpi_target_system_state() and acpi_sleep_init()
for device power management, so introduce
CONFIG_ACPI_SYSTEM_POWER_STATES_SUPPORT and select it for x86 and
ia64 only to make sleep functions available, and also introduce stub
function to allow other drivers to function until S states are defined
for ARM64.

It will be no functional change for x86 and IA64.
