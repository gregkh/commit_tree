tcp: do not rearm rsk_timer on FastOpen requests

FastOpen requests are not like other regular request sockets.

They do not yet use rsk_timer : tcp_fastopen_queue_check()
simply manually removes one expired request from fastopenq->rskq_rst
list.

Therefore, tcp_check_req() must not call mod_timer_pending(),
otherwise we crash because rsk_timer was not initialized.
