ARM: dts: Fix WLAN interrupt line for AM335x EVM-SK

While Sitara AM335x SoCs are very close to OMAP SoCs, the 32-line GPIO
controllers are numbered from 0 on AM335x and from 1 on OMAP. But when
the configuration for the TI WLAN controllers was converted from
platform data to device tree, this detail was overlooked, as 10 boards
were using OMAP with the WL12xx and WL18xx controllers, and only one
was based on AM335x.

This invalid configuration prevents the WL1271 module on the AM335x
EVM-SK from notifying interrupts to the SoC, and breaks the wlan driver.

The DTS must be corrected to use the correct GPIO controller.
