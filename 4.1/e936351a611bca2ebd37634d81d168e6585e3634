staging: sm750fb: wrong type for print

mention correct format specifier while printing.
fixes all the build warnings about incorrect argument type while
printing.
since this is a framebuffer device and it should follow what the
framebuffer layer is suggesting in struct fb_fix_screeninfo at
smem_start and mmio_start, so accordingly changed the datatypes of
vidmem_start, vidreg_start, vidmem_size and vidreg_size.
