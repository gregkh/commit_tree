md/raid0: fix restore to sector variable in raid0_make_request

The variable "sector" in "raid0_make_request()" was improperly updated
by a call to "sector_div()" which modifies its first argument in place.
Commit 47d68979cc968535cb87f3e5f2e6a3533ea48fbd restored this variable
after the call for later re-use.  Unfortunetly the restore was done after
the referenced variable "bio" was advanced.  This lead to the original
value and the restored value being different.  Here we move this line to
the proper place.

One observed side effect of this bug was discarding a file though
unlinking would cause an unrelated file's contents to be discarded.
