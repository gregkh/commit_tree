i40e/i40evf: Remove unused variable an_enable and function update_link_info

An_enable was never used only set so lets remove it. The function
update_link_info only did two things, call get_link_info and set
an_enabled. Therefore we should also remove update_link_info and
change all references to it to get_link_info.
