HID: hid-sensor-hub: fix attribute read for logical usage id

For defining enumeration values like report or power status events, the
enumeration usage ids are enclosed in a logical collection.  In this case we
need to match logical usage id for pending read on this usage id. For example,
in the below field, when read is requested for 0319, the report will
contain one of the status usages like 850, 851 etc. In this case the raw
event will not match 0319. So when logical collection matches, then wake
up the pending thread.

      Physical(Sensor.OtherCustom)
      Logical(Sensor.0319)
      Application(Sensor.Sensor)
      Usage(6)
        Sensor.0850
        Sensor.0851
        Sensor.0852
        Sensor.0853
        Sensor.0854
        Sensor.0855
      Logical Minimum(1)
      Logical Maximum(5)
      Report Size(8)
      Report Count(1)
      Report Offset(24)
