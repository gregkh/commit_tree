iommu: Introduce iommu domain types

This allows to handle domains differently based on their
type in the future. An IOMMU driver can implement certain
optimizations for DMA-API domains for example.

The domain types can be extended later and some of the
existing domain attributes can be migrated to become domain
flags.
