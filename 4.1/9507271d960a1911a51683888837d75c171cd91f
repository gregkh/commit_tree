svcrpc: fix potential GSSX_ACCEPT_SEC_CONTEXT decoding failures

In an environment where the KDC is running Active Directory, the
exported composite name field returned in the context could be large
enough to span a page boundary.  Attaching a scratch buffer to the
decoding xdr_stream helps deal with those cases.

The case where we saw this was actually due to behavior that's been
fixed in newer gss-proxy versions, but we're fixing it here too.
