drm/msm/mdp5: Get SMP client list from mdp5_cfg

SMP blocks are configured for specific client IDs (ports).
These client IDs can be different from one chip to another for a
given pipe.

e.g.: DMA0 pipe fetch Y component is connected to:
 - port #10 for MDP5 v1.3
 - port #4 for MDP5 v1.6

In order to be compatible for upcoming versions of MDP5, the
client ID list is passed through the MDP5 config module rather
than using a list of hard-coded enum values.
