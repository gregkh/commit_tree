staging: comedi: Remove if condition.

This patch removes a if condition which has a semicolon
after it. As the conditional check is redundant, the comment
before it is also changed. The following
coccinelle script was used to detect the pattern of a
semicolon after if.

@r1@
position p;
@@
if (...);@p
@script:python@
p0 << r1.p;
@@
// Emacs org-mode output
cocci.print_main("", p0)
cocci.print_secs("", p0)
