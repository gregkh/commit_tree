Bluetooth: Send global configuration updates to all management users

Changes to the global configuration updates like settings, class of
device, name etc. can be received by every user. They are allowed to
read them in the first place so provide the updates via events as
well. Otherwise untrusted users start polling for updates and that
is not a desired behavior.
