crypto: user - Fix crypto_alg_match race

The function crypto_alg_match returns an algorithm without taking
any references on it.  This means that the algorithm can be freed
at any time, therefore all users of crypto_alg_match are buggy.

This patch fixes this by taking a reference count on the algorithm
to prevent such races.
