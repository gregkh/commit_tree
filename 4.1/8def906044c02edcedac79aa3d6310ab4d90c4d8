timer: Don't initialize 'tvec_base' on hotplug

There is no need to call init_timers_cpu() on every CPU hotplug event,
there is not much we need to reset.

 - Timer-lists are already empty at the end of migrate_timers().
 - timer_jiffies will be refreshed while adding a new timer, after the
   CPU is online again.
 - active_timers and all_timers can be reset from migrate_timers().
