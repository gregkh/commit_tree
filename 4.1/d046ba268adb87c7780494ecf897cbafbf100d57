iio: adis16400: Fix burst transfer for adis16448

The adis16448, unlike the other chips in this family, in addition to the
hardware channels also sends out the DIAG_STAT register in burst mode
before them. Handle that case by skipping over the first 2 bytes before we
pass the received data to the buffer.
