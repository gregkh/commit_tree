hv_netvsc: Eliminate memory allocation in the packet send path

The network protocol used to communicate with the host is the remote ndis (rndis)
protocol. We need to decorate each outgoing packet with a rndis header and
additional rndis state (rndis per-packet state). To manage this state, we
currently allocate memory in the transmit path. Eliminate this allocation by
requesting additional head room in the skb.
