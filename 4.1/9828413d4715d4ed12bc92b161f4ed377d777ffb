tracing: Add enum_map file to show enums that have been mapped

Add a enum_map file in the tracing directory to see what enums have been
saved to convert in the print fmt files.

As this requires the enum mapping to be persistent in memory, it is only
created if the new config option CONFIG_TRACE_ENUM_MAP_FILE is enabled.
This is for debugging and will increase the persistent memory footprint
of the kernel.
