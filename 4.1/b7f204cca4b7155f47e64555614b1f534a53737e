f2fs: check its block allocation to avoid producing wrong dirty pages

If a page is cached but its block was deallocated, we don't need to make
the page dirty again by gc and truncate_partial_data_page.

In that case, it needs to check its block allocation all the time instead
of giving up-to-date page.
