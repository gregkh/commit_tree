i40e: notify VFs of link state

Gratuitously notify VFs of link state when they activate their queues.
In general, this is the last thing that a VF driver will do as it opens
its interface, so this is a good time to notify the VF.

Currently, VF devices assume link is up unless told otherwise, which
means that VFs instantiated on a PF with no link will report the wrong
state. This change corrects that issue.
