gpio: dwapb: remove dependencies

The Synopsys DesignWare DWAPB GPIO block is popular to
synthesize amongst many architectures: X86, ARM, ARC.
The driver was restricted to only these archs due to
using [read|write]l_relaxed() accessors that were not
universally available in the past,
but as of commit 9439eb3ab9d1ece6e4ad7baaa4a7f534f9b9dab0
"asm-generic: io: implement relaxed accessor macros as
conditional wrappers" these accessors are available on all
archs so this should not be a problem any more. Enable the
driver for all archs.
