ebpf: remove kernel test stubs

Now that we have BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER up and running, we can
remove the test stubs which were added to get the verifier suite up.

We can just let the test cases probe under socket filter type instead.
In the fill/spill test case, we cannot (yet) access fields from the
context (skb), but we may adapt that test case in future.
