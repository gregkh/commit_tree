drm: Pass in new and old plane state to prepare_fb and cleanup_fb

Use cases like rotation require these hooks to have some context so they
know how to prepare and cleanup the frame buffer correctly.

For i915 specifically, object backing pages need to be mapped differently
for different rotation modes and the driver needs to know which mapping to
instantiate and which to tear down when transitioning between them.

v2: Made passed in states const. (Daniel Vetter)
