dax: unify ext2/4_{dax,}_file_operations

The original dax patchset split the ext2/4_file_operations because of the
two NULL splice_read/splice_write in the dax case.

In the vfs if splice_read/splice_write are NULL we then call
default_splice_read/write.

What we do here is make generic_file_splice_read aware of IS_DAX() so the
original ext2/4_file_operations can be used as is.

For write it appears that iter_file_splice_write is just fine.  It uses
the regular f_op->write(file,..) or new_sync_write(file, ...).
