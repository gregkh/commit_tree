drm/nouveau/platform: probe IOMMU if present

Tegra SoCs have an IOMMU that can be used to present non-contiguous
physical memory as contiguous to the GPU and maximize the use of large
pages in the GPU MMU, leading to performance gains. This patch adds
support for probing such a IOMMU if present and make its properties
available in the nouveau_platform_gpu structure so subsystems can take
advantage of it.
