md: re-add a failed disk

This adds the capability of re-adding a failed disk by
writing "re-add" to /sys/block/mdXX/md/dev-YYY/state.

This facilitates adding disks which have encountered a temporary
error such as a network disconnection/hiccup in an iSCSI device,
or a SAN cable disconnection which has been restored. In such
a situation, you do not need to remove and re-add the device.
Writing re-add to the failed device's state would add it again
to the array and perform the recovery of only the blocks which
were written after the device failed.

This works for generic md, and is not related to clustering. However,
this patch is to ease re-add operations listed above in clustering
environments.
