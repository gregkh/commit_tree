parisc: Eliminate sg_virt_addr() and private scatterlist.h

The only reason to keep parisc's private asm/scatterlist.h was that it
had the macro sg_virt_addr().  Convert all callers to use something else
(sometimes just sg->offset was enough, others should use sg_virt()), and
we can just use the asm-generic scatterlist.h instead.
