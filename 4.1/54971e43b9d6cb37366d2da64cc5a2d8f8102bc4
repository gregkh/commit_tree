ARM64: kernel: acpi: refactor ACPI tables init and checks

Current ACPI init code on ARM64 relies on acpi_table_parse() API to
check if the FADT is present and to carry out sanity checks on that.

The handler passed to the acpi_table_parse() function and used to
carry out the parsing on the requested table returns a value that is
ignored by the acpi_table_parse() function, so it is not possible
to propagate errors back to the acpi_table_parse() caller through
the handler.

This forces ARM64 ACPI init code to have disable_acpi() calls scattered
all over the place that makes code unwieldy and not easy to follow.

This patch refactors the ARM64 ACPI init code, by creating a
self-contained function (ie acpi_fadt_sanity_check()) that carries
out the required checks on FADT and returns an adequate return value
to the caller. This allows creating a common error path that disables
ACPI and makes code more readable and easy to parse and change were
further checks FADT to be added in the future.
