ARM: dts: imx23-olinuxino: Fix dr_mode of usb0

The dr_mode of usb0 on imx233-olinuxino is left to default "otg".
Since the green LED (GPIO2_1) on imx233-olinuxino is connected to the
same pin as USB_OTG_ID it's possible to disable USB host by LED toggling:

echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/green/brightness
[ 1068.890000] ci_hdrc ci_hdrc.0: remove, state 1
[ 1068.890000] usb usb1: USB disconnect, device number 1
[ 1068.920000] usb 1-1: USB disconnect, device number 2
[ 1068.920000] usb 1-1.1: USB disconnect, device number 3
[ 1069.070000] usb 1-1.2: USB disconnect, device number 4
[ 1069.450000] ci_hdrc ci_hdrc.0: USB bus 1 deregistered
[ 1074.460000] ci_hdrc ci_hdrc.0: timeout waiting for 00000800 in 11

This patch fixes the issue by setting dr_mode to "host" in the dts file.
