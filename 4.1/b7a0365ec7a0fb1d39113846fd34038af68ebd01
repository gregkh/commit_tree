Btrfs: ctree: reduce args where only fs_info used

This patch is part of a larger project to cleanup btrfs's internal usage
of struct btrfs_root. Many functions take btrfs_root only to grab a
pointer to fs_info.

This causes programmers to ponder which root can be passed. Since only
the fs_info is read affected functions can accept any root, except this
is only obvious upon inspection.

This patch reduces the specificty of such functions to accept the
fs_info directly.

This patch does not address the two functions in ctree.c (insert_ptr,
and split_item) which only use root for BUG_ONs in ctree.c

This patch affects the following functions:
  1) fixup_low_keys
  2) btrfs_set_item_key_safe
