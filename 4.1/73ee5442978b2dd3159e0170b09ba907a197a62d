net/fsl: modify xgmac_mdio for little endian SoCs

MDIO controller on little endian Socs, e.g. ls2085a is similar to the
controller on big endian Socs, but the MDIO access is little endian,
we use I/O accessor function to handle endianness, so the driver can
run on little endian Socs. A property "little-endian" is used
in DTS to indicate the MDIO is little endian, if driver probes the
property, driver will access MDIO in little endian, otherwise, driver
works in big endian by default.
