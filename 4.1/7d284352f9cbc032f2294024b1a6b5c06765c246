ACPI / scan: Add a scan handler for PRP0001

If the special PRP0001 device ID is present in the given device's list
of ACPI/PNP IDs and the device has a valid "compatible" property in
the _DSD, it should be enumerated using the default mechanism,
unless some scan handlers match the IDs preceding PRP0001 in the
device's list of ACPI/PNP IDs.  In addition to that, no scan handlers
matching the IDs following PRP0001 in that list should be attached
to the device.

To make that happen, define a scan handler that will match PRP0001
and trigger the default enumeration for the matching devices if the
"compatible" property is present for them.

Since that requires the check for platform_id and device->handler
to be removed from acpi_default_enumeration(), move the fallback
invocation of acpi_default_enumeration() to acpi_bus_attach()
(after it's checked if there's a matching ACPI driver for the
device), which is a better place to call it, and do the platform_id
check in there too (device->handler is guaranteed to be unset at
the point where the function is looking for a matching ACPI driver).
