xfs: cleanup xfs_rename error handling

The jump labels are ambiguous and unclear and some of the error
paths are used inconsistently. Rules for error jumps are:

- use out_trans_cancel for unmodified transaction context
- use out_bmap_cancel on ENOSPC errors
- use out_trans_abort when transaction is likely to be dirty.
