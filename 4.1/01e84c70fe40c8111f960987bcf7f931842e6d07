xtensa: provide __NR_sync_file_range2 instead of __NR_sync_file_range

xtensa actually uses sync_file_range2 implementation, so it should
define __NR_sync_file_range2 as other architectures that use that
function. That fixes userspace interface (that apparently never worked)
and avoids special-casing xtensa in libc implementations.

for more details.
