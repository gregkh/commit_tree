wlcore: set irq_trigger in board files instead of hiding behind a quirk

The platform_quirk element in the platform data was used
to change the way the IRQ is triggered.  When set,
the EDGE_IRQ quirk would change the irqflags used
and treat edge trigger differently from the rest.

Instead of hiding this irq flag setting behind the quirk,
have the board files set the irq_trigger explicitly.

This will allow us to use standard irq DT definitions
later on.
