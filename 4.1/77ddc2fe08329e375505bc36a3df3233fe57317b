ACPICA: Tables: Don't release ACPI_MTX_TABLES in acpi_tb_install_standard_table().

ACPICA commit c70434d4da13e65b6163c79a5aa16b40193631c7

ACPI_MTX_TABLES is acquired and released by the callers of
acpi_tb_install_standard_table() so releasing it in the function itself is
causing the following error in Linux kernel if the table is reloaded:

ACPI Error: Mutex [0x2] is not acquired, cannot release (20141107/utmutex-321)
Call Trace:
  [<ffffffff81b0bd48>] dump_stack+0x4f/0x7b
  [<ffffffff81546bf5>] acpi_ut_release_mutex+0x47/0x67
  [<ffffffff81544357>] acpi_load_table+0x73/0xcb
