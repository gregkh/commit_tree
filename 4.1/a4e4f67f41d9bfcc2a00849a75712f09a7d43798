parisc: %pf is only for function pointers

Use %ps for actual addresses, otherwise you'll get bad output
on arches like parisc64 where %pf expects a function descriptor.

This wasn't normally seen on parisc64 because the code is not built
unless DEBUG_SUPERIO_INIT is manually defined.

Patch modified by Helge Deller to utilize KERN_DEBUG.
