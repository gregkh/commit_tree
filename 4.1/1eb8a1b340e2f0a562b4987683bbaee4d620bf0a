crypto: amcc - remove incorrect __init/__exit markups

Even if bus is not hot-pluggable, the devices can be bound and unbound
from the driver via sysfs, so we should not be using __init/__exit
annotations on probe() and remove() methods. The only exception is
drivers registered with platform_driver_probe() which specifically
disables sysfs bind/unbind attributes.
