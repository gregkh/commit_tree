net: kernel socket should be released in init_net namespace

Creating a kernel socket with sock_create_kern() happens in "init_net"
namespace, however, releasing it with sk_release_kernel() occurs in
the current namespace which may be different with "init_net" namespace.
Therefore, we should guarantee that the namespace in which a kernel
socket is created is same as the socket is created.
