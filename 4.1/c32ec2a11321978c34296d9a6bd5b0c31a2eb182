bcma: make bcma_host_pci_(up|down) calls safe for every config

We were providing declarations but actual code was compiled only with
CONFIG_BCMA_HOST_PCI set. This could result in:
ERROR: "bcma_host_pci_down" [drivers/net/wireless/brcm80211/brcmsmac/brcmsmac.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "bcma_host_pci_up" [drivers/net/wireless/brcm80211/brcmsmac/brcmsmac.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "bcma_host_pci_down" [drivers/net/wireless/b43/b43.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "bcma_host_pci_up" [drivers/net/wireless/b43/b43.ko] undefined!
