clk: tegra: Use generic tegra_osc_clk_init() on Tegra114

There is no reason why Tegra114 cannot use the same generic code to set
up the oscillator, clk_m and pll_ref clocks. The only effective change
that this causes is that the CLK_SET_PARENT_RATE flag is dropped, but
since these clocks are all fixed it is not needed anyway.
