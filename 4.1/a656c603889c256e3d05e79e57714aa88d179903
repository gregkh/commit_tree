ARM: shmobile: ape6evm dts: Move Ethernet node to BSC

Move the Ethernet node from the ad-hoc lbsc node to the BSC node,
as its connected to the Bus State Controller.  This allows the system to
know the right position of the Ethernet node in the clock and PM domain
hierarchy, and manage the clock and PM domain appropriately.
