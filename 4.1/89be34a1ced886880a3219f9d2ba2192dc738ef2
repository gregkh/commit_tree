iommu: Remove domain_init and domain_free iommu_ops

All drivers have been converted to the new domain_alloc and
domain_free iommu-ops. So remove the old ones and get rid of
iommu_domain->priv too, as this is no longer needed when the
struct iommu_domain is embedded in the private structures of
the iommu drivers.
