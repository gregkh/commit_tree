Bluetooth: Fix error returns for Read Local OOB Extended Data commands

The Read Local OOB Extended Data commands are required to return the
address type and the data length at least. However currently the error
returns only the address type.

To fix this and avoid any extra allocations or stack memory, rearrange
the code so that the same path can be used for error returns.
