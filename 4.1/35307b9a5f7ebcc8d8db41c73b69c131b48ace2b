arm/arm64: KVM: Implement Stage-2 page aging

Until now, KVM/arm didn't care much for page aging (who was swapping
anyway?), and simply provided empty hooks to the core KVM code. With
server-type systems now being available, things are quite different.

This patch implements very simple support for page aging, by clearing
the Access flag in the Stage-2 page tables. On access fault, the current
fault handling will write the PTE or PMD again, putting the Access flag
back on.

It should be possible to implement a much faster handling for Access
faults, but that's left for a later patch.

With this in place, performance in VMs is degraded much more gracefully.
