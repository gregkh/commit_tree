Revert "[media] Add device tree support to adp1653 flash driver"

As requested by Sakari:

	"The driver changes are still being reviewed.
	 It's been proposed that the max-microamp property be renamed."

So, as the DT bindings are not agreed upstream yet, let's revert
it.

This reverts commit b6100f10bdc2019a65297d2597c388de2f7dd653.
