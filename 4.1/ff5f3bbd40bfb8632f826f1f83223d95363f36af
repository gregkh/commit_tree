perf sched replay: Use replay_repeat to calculate the runavg of cpu usage instead of the default value 10

Since sched->replay_repeat is set to 10 as default, the sched->run_avg,
sched->runavg_cpu_usage, and sched->runavg_parent_cpu_usage all use
10 to calculate their value.

However, the replay_repeat can be changed to other value by using -r
option, so the calculation above should use replay_repeat to achieve
more accurate results instead of the default value 10.
