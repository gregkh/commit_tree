ARM: 8219/1: handle interworking and out-of-range relocations separately

Currently, interworking calls on module boundaries are not supported,
and are handled by the same error handling code path as non-interworking
calls whose targets are simply out of range.

Before modifying the handling of those out-of-range jump and call
relocations in a subsequent patch, move the handling of interworking
restrictions out of it.
