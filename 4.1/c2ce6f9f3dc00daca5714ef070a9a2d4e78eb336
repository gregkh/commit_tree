powerpc: Change vrX register defines to vX to match gcc and glibc

As our various loops (copy, string, crypto etc) get more complicated,
we want to share implementations between userspace (eg glibc) and
the kernel. We also want to write userspace test harnesses to put
in tools/testing/selftest.

One gratuitous difference between userspace and the kernel is the
VMX register definitions - the kernel uses vrX whereas both gcc and
glibc use vX.

Change the kernel to match userspace.
