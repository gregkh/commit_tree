net/mlx4_core: Raise slave shutdown event upon FLR

There might be cases that PF doesn't get a "reset" command upon slave down
(e.g. virsh destroy). In these cases, however, an FLR event is issued.

Therefore, when the PF receives an FLR event for a slave, it should also
generate a shutdown event on the PF for that slave, to let the PF upper
layers (mlx4_ib, eth) perform any required cleanup/actions associated
with slave shutdown.
