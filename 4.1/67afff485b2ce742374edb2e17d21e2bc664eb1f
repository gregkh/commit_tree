perf tools: Fix the bash completion for listing subsubcommands of perf subcommand

The bash completion does not support listing subsubcommands for 'perf
kvm|kmem|mem|lock|sched --<long option> <TAB>', where 'kvm|kmem|mem|
lock|sched' are all subcommands of perf.

Example:

Before this patch:

 $ perf kvm --verbose <TAB>
 $

As shown above, the subsubcommands of perf kvm does not come out.

After this patch:

 $ perf kvm --verbose <TAB>
 buildid-list  diff          record        report        stat
 top

As shown above, the subsubcommands of perf kvm can come out now.
