drm/i915: Rename to GEN8_LEGACY_PDPES

In gen8, 32b PPGTT has always had one "pdp" (it doesn't actually have
one, but it resembles having one). The #define was confusing as is, and
using "PDPE" is a much better description.

sed -i 's/GEN8_LEGACY_PDPS/GEN8_LEGACY_PDPES/' drivers/gpu/drm/i915/*.[ch]

It also matches the x86 pagetable terminology:
PTE  = Page Table Entry - pagetable level 1 page
PDE  = Page Directory Entry - pagetable level 2 page
PDPE = Page Directory Pointer Entry - pagetable level 3 page

And in the near future (for 48b addressing):
PML4E = Page Map Level 4 Entry

v2: Expanded information about Page Directory/Table nomenclature.
