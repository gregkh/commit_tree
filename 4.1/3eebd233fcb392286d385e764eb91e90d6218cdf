lguest: handle traps on the "interrupt suppressed" iret instruction.

Lguest's "iret" is non-atomic, as it needs to restore the interrupt
state before the real iret (the guest can't actually suppress
interrupts).  For this reason, the host discards an interrupt if it
occurs in this (1-instruction) window.

We can do better, by emulating the iret execution, then immediately
setting up the interrupt handler.  In fact, we don't need to do much,
as emulating the iret and setting up th stack for the interrupt handler
basically cancel each other out.
