thp: do not adjust zone water marks if khugepaged is not started

set_recommended_min_free_kbytes() adjusts zone water marks to be suitable
for khugepaged. We avoid doing this if khugepaged is disabled, but don't
catch the case when khugepaged is failed to start.

Let's address this by checking khugepaged_thread instead of
khugepaged_enabled() in set_recommended_min_free_kbytes().
It's NULL if the kernel thread is stopped or failed to start.
