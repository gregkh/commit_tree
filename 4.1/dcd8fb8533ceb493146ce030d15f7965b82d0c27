ipv4: Raise tcp PMTU probe mss base size

Quotes from RFC4821 7.2.  Selecting Initial Values

   It is RECOMMENDED that search_low be initially set to an MTU size
   that is likely to work over a very wide range of environments.  Given
   today's technologies, a value of 1024 bytes is probably safe enough.
   The initial value for search_low SHOULD be configurable.

Moreover, set a small value will introduce extra time for the search
to converge. So set the initial probe base mss size to 1024 Bytes.
