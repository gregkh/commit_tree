mtd: nand: Prevent possible kernel lockup in nand_command()

If a NAND device is not really present or pin muxes are not correctly
configured we can lock up the kernel waiting infinitely for NAND_STATUS
to be ready.

This can be easily reproduced on TI's DRA7-evm board by booting it
without NAND support in u-boot and disabling NAND pin muxes in the kernel.

Add timeout when waiting for NAND_CMD_RESET completion. As per ONFi v4.0
tRST can be upto 250ms for EZ-NAND and 5ms for raw NAND.
