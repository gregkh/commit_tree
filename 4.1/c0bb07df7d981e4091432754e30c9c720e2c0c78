netlink: Reset portid after netlink_insert failure

The commit c5adde9468b0714a051eac7f9666f23eb10b61f7 ("netlink:
eliminate nl_sk_hash_lock") breaks the autobind retry mechanism
because it doesn't reset portid after a failed netlink_insert.

This means that should autobind fail the first time around, then
the socket will be stuck in limbo as it can never be bound again
since it already has a non-zero portid.
