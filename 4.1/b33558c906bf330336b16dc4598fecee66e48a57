ARM: dts: AM35xx: fix system control module clocks

New system control module layout for omap3 overlooked parts of the am35xx
configuration. Basically the am35xx clocks were not converted to use the
changed offsets, which caused weird boot warnings. The errors were not
fatal so far, so they were not caught earlier. Fixed by applying the
proper offsets for the AM35xx scm clocks.
