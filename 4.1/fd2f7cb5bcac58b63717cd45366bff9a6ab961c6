kill struct filename.separate

just make const char iname[] the last member and compare name->name with
name->iname instead of checking name->separate

We need to make sure that out-of-line name doesn't end up allocated adjacent
to struct filename refering to it; fortunately, it's easy to achieve - just
allocate that struct filename with one byte in ->iname[], so that ->iname[0]
will be inside the same object and thus have an address different from that
of out-of-line name [spotted by Boqun Feng <boqun.feng@gmail.com>]
