perf build: Move features build output under features directory

Following commit introduced features build dump:
  443a70541c56 perf tools: Output feature detection's gcc output to a file

Moving them into to have code more compact and renaming build dump
files. For each feature 'test-X' new file 'test-X.make.output' is
created and contains the build out.  It's created in the same directory
as the feature itself.
