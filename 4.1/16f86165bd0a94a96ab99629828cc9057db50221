inet: fill request sock ir_iif for IPv4

Once request socks will be in ehash table, they will need to have
a valid ir_iff field.

This is currently true only for IPv6. This patch extends support
for IPv4 as well.

This means inet_diag_fill_req() can now properly use ir_iif,
which is better for IPv6 link locals anyway, as request sockets
and established sockets will propagate consistent netlink idiag_if.
