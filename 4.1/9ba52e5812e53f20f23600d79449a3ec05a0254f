blk-mq: don't lose requests if a stopped queue restarts

Normally if driver is busy to dispatch a request the logic is like below:
block layer:					driver:
	__blk_mq_run_hw_queue
a.						blk_mq_stop_hw_queue
b.	rq add to ctx->dispatch

later:
1.						blk_mq_start_hw_queue
2.	__blk_mq_run_hw_queue

But it's possible step 1-2 runs between a and b. And since rq isn't in
ctx->dispatch yet, step 2 will not run rq. The rq might get lost if
there are no subsequent requests kick in.
