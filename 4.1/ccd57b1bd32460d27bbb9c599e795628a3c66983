rhashtable: Add immediate rehash during insertion

This patch reintroduces immediate rehash during insertion.  If
we find during insertion that the table is full or the chain
length exceeds a set limit (currently 16 but may be disabled
with insecure_elasticity) then we will force an immediate rehash.
The rehash will contain an expansion if the table utilisation
exceeds 75%.

If this rehash fails then the insertion will fail.  Otherwise the
insertion will be reattempted in the new hash table.
