um: add a kmsg_dumper

Add a kmsg_dumper, that dumps the kmsg buffer to stdout, when no console
is available. This an enables the printing of early panic() calls
triggered in uml_postsetup().
When a panic() call happens so early in the UML kernel no
earlyprintk/console is available yet, but with a kmsg_dumper in place
the kernel message buffer will be outputted to the user, to give a
better hint, of what the failure was.
