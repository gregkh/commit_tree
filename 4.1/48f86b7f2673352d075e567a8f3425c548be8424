Bluetooth: Move Service Discovery logic before refactoring

This patch moves whole packet filering logic of service discovery
into new function is_filter_match. It's done because logic inside
mgmt_device_found is very complicated and needs some
simplification.

Also having whole logic in one place will allow to simplify it in
the future.
