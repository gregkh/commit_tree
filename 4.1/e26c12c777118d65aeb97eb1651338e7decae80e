lib/vsprintf.c: reduce stack use in number()

At least since the initial git commit, when base was passed as a separate
parameter, number() has only been called with bases 8, 10 and 16.  I'm
guessing that 66 was to accommodate 64 0/1, a sign and a '\0', but the
buffer is only used for the actual digits.  Octal digits carry 3 bits of
information, so 24 is enough.  Spell that 3*sizeof(num) so one less place
needs to be changed should long long ever be 128 bits.  Also remove the
commented-out code that would handle an arbitrary base.
