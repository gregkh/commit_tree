drm: change connector to tmp_connector

This wasn't too harmful since we already look at connector,
which has the same effect as the loop for any non-cloned configs.
Only when we have a cloned configuration is it important to look
at other connectors. Furthermore existing userspace always changes
dpms on all of them anyway.
