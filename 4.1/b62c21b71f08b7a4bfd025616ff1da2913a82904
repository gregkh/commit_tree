blk-mq: add blk_mq_init_allocated_queue and export blk_mq_register_disk

Add a variant of blk_mq_init_queue that allows a previously allocated
queue to be initialized.  blk_mq_init_allocated_queue models
blk_init_allocated_queue -- which was also created for DM's use.

DM's approach to device creation requires a placeholder request_queue be
allocated for use with alloc_dev() but the decision about what type of
request_queue will be ultimately created is deferred until all component
devices referenced in the DM table are processed to determine the table
type (request-based, blk-mq request-based, or bio-based).

Also, because of DM's late finalization of the request_queue type
the call to blk_mq_register_disk() doesn't happen during alloc_dev().
Must export blk_mq_register_disk() so that DM can backfill the 'mq' dir
once the blk-mq queue is fully allocated.
