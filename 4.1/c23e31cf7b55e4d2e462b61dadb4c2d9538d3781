mac80211: initialize rate control earlier for tdls station

Currently when TDLS station in driver goes from authenticated
to associated state it can not use rate control parameters
because rate control is not initialized yet. Some drivers
require parameters already initialized by rate control when
entering associated state. It can be done by initializing
rate control after station transition to associated state but
before notifying driver about that.
