md/raid5: don't record new size if resize_stripes fails.

If any memory allocation in resize_stripes fails we will return
-ENOMEM, but in some cases we update conf->pool_size anyway.

This means that if we try again, the allocations will be assumed
to be larger than they are, and badness results.

So only update pool_size if there is no error.

This bug was introduced in 2.6.17 and the patch is suitable for
-stable.
