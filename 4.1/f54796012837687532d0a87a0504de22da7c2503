IB/mlx4: Change init flow to request alias GUIDs for active VFs

Change the init flow to ask GUIDs only for active VFs. This is done for
both SM & HOST modes so that there is no need any more to maintain the
ownership record type.

In case SM mode is used, the initial value will be 0, ask the SM to assign,
for the HOST mode the initial value will be the HOST generated GUID.

This will enable out of the box experience for both probed and attached VFs.
