ARM: kvm: implement replacement for ld's LOG2CEIL()

Commit 06f75a1f6200 ("ARM, arm64: kvm: get rid of the bounce
page") uses ld's builtin function LOG2CEIL() to align the
KVM init code to a log2 upper bound of its size. However,
this function turns out to be a fairly recent addition to
binutils, which breaks the build for older toolchains.

So instead, implement a replacement LOG2_ROUNDUP() using
the C preprocessor.
