sfc: Revert SRIOV changes.

This reverts commits:

d92916f71a57582ce7276547510cedb2c10b6bd6 ("sfc: Own header for nic-specific sriov functions,")
25672dba9535b804331145379c79f835ba2205c5 ("sfc: Enable VF's via a write to the sysfs file
 sriov_numvfs")

As they break the build with SRIOV disabled and there is no
easy way to fix it the way things are arranged.
