mmc: dw_mmc: Add locking around cmd11 timer

It is possible for the cmd11 interrupt to fire and delete the
cmd11_timer before the cmd11_timer was actually setup.  Let's fix this
race by adding a few spinlocks.  Note that the race wasn't seen in
practice without adding some printk statements, but it still seems
wise to fix.
