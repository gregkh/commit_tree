powerpc: Align TOC to 256 bytes

Recent toolchains force the TOC to be 256 byte aligned. We need
to enforce this alignment in our linker script, otherwise pointers
to our TOC variables (__toc_start, __prom_init_toc_start) could
be incorrect.

If they are bad, we die a few hundred instructions into boot.
