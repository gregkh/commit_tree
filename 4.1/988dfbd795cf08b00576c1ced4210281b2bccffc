rhashtable: Move hash_rnd into bucket_table

Currently hash_rnd is a parameter that users can set.  However,
no existing users set this parameter.  It is also something that
people are unlikely to want to set directly since it's just a
random number.

In preparation for allowing the reseeding/rehashing of rhashtable,
this patch moves hash_rnd into bucket_table so that it's now an
internal state rather than a parameter.
