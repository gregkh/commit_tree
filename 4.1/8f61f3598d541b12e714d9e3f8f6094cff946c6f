tools/power turbostat: label base frequency

syntax only.

The cool kids are now using the phrase "base frequency",
where in the past we used "max non-turbo frequency" or "TSC frequency".

This distinction becomes important when a processor has a TSC
that runs at a different speed than the "base frequency".
