Revert "net: core: 'ethtool' issue with querying phy settings"

This reverts commit f96dee13b8e10f00840124255bed1d8b4c6afd6f.

It isn't right, ethtool is meant to manage one PHY instance
per netdevice at a time, and this is selected by the SET
command.  Therefore by definition the GET command must only
return the settings for the configured and selected PHY.
