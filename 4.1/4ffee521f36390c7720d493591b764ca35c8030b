clockevents: Make suspend/resume calls explicit

clockevents_notify() is a leftover from the early design of the
clockevents facility. It's really not a notification mechanism,
it's a multiplex call.

We are way better off to have explicit calls instead of this
monstrosity. Split out the suspend/resume() calls and invoke
them directly from the call sites.

No locking required at this point because these calls happen
with interrupts disabled and a single cpu online.
