of: iommu: Add ptr to OF node arg to of_iommu_configure()

of_iommu_configure() is called from of_dma_configure() to setup iommu ops
using DT property.  This API is currently used for platform devices for
which DMA configuration (including IOMMU ops) may come from the device's
parent.  To extend this functionality for PCI devices, this API needs to
take a parent node ptr as an argument instead of assuming device's parent.
This is needed since for PCI, the DMA configuration may be defined in the
DT node of the root bus bridge's parent device.  Currently only dma-range
is used for PCI and IOMMU is not supported.  Return error if the device is
PCI.

Add "parent" parameter (a struct device_node *) to of_iommu_configure().
