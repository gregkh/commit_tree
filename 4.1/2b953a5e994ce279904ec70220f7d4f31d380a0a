xen: Suspend ticks on all CPUs during suspend

Commit 77e32c89a711 ("clockevents: Manage device's state separately for
the core") decouples clockevent device's modes from states. With this
change when a Xen guest tries to resume, it won't be calling its
set_mode op which needs to be done on each VCPU in order to make the
hypervisor aware that we are in oneshot mode.

This happens because clockevents_tick_resume() (which is an intermediate
step of resuming ticks on a processor) doesn't call clockevents_set_state()
anymore and because during suspend clockevent devices on all VCPUs (except
for the one doing the suspend) are left in ONESHOT state. As result, during
resume the clockevents state machine will assume that device is already
where it should be and doesn't need to be updated.

To avoid this problem we should suspend ticks on all VCPUs during
suspend.
