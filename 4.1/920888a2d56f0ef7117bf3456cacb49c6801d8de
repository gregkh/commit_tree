drm: rcar-du: Implement planes atomic operations

Implement the CRTC .atomic_begin() and .atomic_flush() operations, the
plane .atomic_check(), .atomic_update() and operations, and use the
transitional atomic helpers to implement the plane update and disable
operations on top of the new atomic operations.

The plane setup code can't be moved out of the CRTC start function
completely yet, as the atomic code paths are not taken every time the
CRTC needs to be started. This results in some code duplication that
will be fixed after switching to atomic updates completely.
