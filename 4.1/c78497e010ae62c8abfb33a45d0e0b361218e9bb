ALSA: ctl: confirm to return all identical information in 'activate' event

When event originator doesn't set numerical ID in identical information,
the event data includes no numerical ID, thus userspace applications
cannot identify the control just by unique ID in event data.

This commit fix this bug so as the event data includes all of identical
information.
