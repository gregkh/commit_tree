KVM: ioapic: Record edge-triggered interrupts delivery status

This patch fixes the bug discussed in
https://www.mail-archive.com/kvm@vger.kernel.org/msg109813.html

This patch uses a new field named irr_delivered to record the
delivery status of edge-triggered interrupts, and clears the
delivered interrupts in kvm_get_ioapic. So it has the same effect
of commit 0bc830b05c667218d703f2026ec866c49df974fc
("KVM: ioapic: clear IRR for edge-triggered interrupts at delivery")
while avoids the bug of Windows guests.
