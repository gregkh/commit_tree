clk: Add PWM clock driver

Some board designers, when running out of clock output pads, decide to
(mis)use PWM output pads to provide a clock to external components.
This driver supports this practice by providing an adapter between the
PWM and clock bindings in the device tree. As the PWM bindings specify
the period in the device tree, this is a fixed clock.
