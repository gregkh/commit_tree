powerpc: Remove the celleb support

The celleb code has seen no actual development for ~7 years.

We (maintainers) have no access to test hardware, and it is highly
likely the code has bit-rotted.

As far as we're aware the hardware was never widely available, and is
certainly no longer available, and no one on the list has shown any
interest in it over the years.

So remove it. If anyone has one and cares please speak up.
