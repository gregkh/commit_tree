xfs: move DIO mapping size calculation

The mapping size calculation is done last in __xfs_get_blocks(), but
we are going to need the actual mapping size we will use to map the
direct IO correctly in xfs_map_direct(). Factor out the calculation
for code clarity, and move the call to be the first operation in
mapping the extent to the returned buffer.
