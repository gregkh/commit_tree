spi: pl022: Remove incorrect TxFIFO full reporting

According to PL022 specification, TNF bit states for "Transmit FIFO Not full".
So the logic here is inverted. But "Receive Overrun Interrupt", which is handled
here, is only triggered on Rx errors. So instead of fixing the if statement,
remove the whole message.
