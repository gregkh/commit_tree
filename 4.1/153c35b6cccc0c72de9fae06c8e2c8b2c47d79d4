Btrfs: fix regression in raid level conversion

Commit 2f0810880f082fa8ba66ab2c33b02e4ff9770a5e changed
btrfs_set_block_group_ro to avoid trying to allocate new chunks with the
new raid profile during conversion.  This fixed failures when there was
no space on the drive to allocate a new chunk, but the metadata
reserves were sufficient to continue the conversion.

But this ended up causing a regression when the drive had plenty of
space to allocate new chunks, mostly because reduce_alloc_profile isn't
using the new raid profile.

Fixing btrfs_reduce_alloc_profile is a bigger patch.  For now, do a
partial revert of 2f0810880, and don't error out if we hit ENOSPC.
