dmaengine: Remove memset leftovers

Commit 48a9db462d99 ("drivers/dma: remove unused support for MEMSET
operations") removed support for the memset operation in dmaengine, but left
the fill_aligned field that was supposed to set the buffer alignment for the
memset operations.

Remove that field too.
