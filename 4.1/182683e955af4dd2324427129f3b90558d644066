drivers/rtc/class.c: initialize rtc name early

In some error cases RTC name is used before it is initialized:

	rtc-rs5c372 0-0032: clock needs to be set
	rtc-rs5c372 0-0032: rs5c372b found, 24hr, driver version 0.6
	rtc (null): read_time: fail to read
	rtc-rs5c372 0-0032: rtc core: registered rtc-rs5c372 as rtc0

Fix by initializing the name early.
