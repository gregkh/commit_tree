netfilter: Pass socket pointer down through okfn().

On the output paths in particular, we have to sometimes deal with two
socket contexts.  First, and usually skb->sk, is the local socket that
generated the frame.

And second, is potentially the socket used to control a tunneling
socket, such as one the encapsulates using UDP.

We do not want to disassociate skb->sk when encapsulating in order
to fix this, because that would break socket memory accounting.

The most extreme case where this can cause huge problems is an
AF_PACKET socket transmitting over a vxlan device.  We hit code
paths doing checks that assume they are dealing with an ipv4
socket, but are actually operating upon the AF_PACKET one.
