tile: ftrace: fix function_graph tracer issues

- Add support for ARCH_SUPPORTS_FTRACE_OPS
- Replace the instruction in ftrace_call with the bundle {move r10, lr;
jal ftrace_stub}, so that the lr contains the right value after returning
from ftrace_stub.  An alternative fix might be to leave the instruction
in ftrace_call alone when it is being updated with ftrace_stub.
