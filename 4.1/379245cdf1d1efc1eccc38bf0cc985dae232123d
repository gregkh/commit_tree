MIPS: KVM: Expose FPU registers

Add KVM register numbers for the MIPS FPU registers, and implement
access to them with the KVM_GET_ONE_REG / KVM_SET_ONE_REG ioctls when
the FPU capability is enabled (exposed in a later patch) and present in
the guest according to its Config1.FP bit.

The registers are accessible in the current mode of the guest, with each
sized access showing what the guest would see with an equivalent access,
and like the architecture they may become UNPREDICTABLE if the FR mode
is changed. When FR=0, odd doubles are inaccessible as they do not exist
in that mode.
