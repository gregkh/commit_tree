Bluetooth: Fix AMP init for certain AMP controllers

Some AMP controllers do not support the Read Local Features HCI commands
(even though according to the spec they should). Luckily they at least
correctly omit this from the supported commands bitmask, so we can work
around the issue by creating a second AMP init phase and issuing the HCI
command conditionally there.
