ARM: dts: DRA7: Remove ti,timer-dsp and ti,timer-pwm properties

Remove the 'ti,timer-dsp' and 'ti,timer-pwm' properties from the timer
nodes that still have them. This seems to be copied from OMAP5, on
which only certain timers are capable of providing PWM functionality
or be able to interrupt the DSP. All the GPTimers On DRA7 are capable
of PWM and interrupting any core (due to the presence of Crossbar).

These properties were used by the driver to add capabilities to each
timer, and support requesting timers by capability. In the DT world,
we expect any users of timers to use phandles to the respective timer,
and use the omap_dm_timer_request_by_node() API. The API to request
using capabilities, omap_dm_timer_request_by_cap() API should be
deprecated eventually.
