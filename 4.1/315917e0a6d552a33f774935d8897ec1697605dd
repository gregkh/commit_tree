Bluetooth: Fix accepting early data on fixed channels

On BR/EDR the L2CAP channel instances for fixed channels have so far
been marked as ready only once the L2CAP information req/rsp procedure
is complete and we have the fixed channel mask. This could however lead
to data being dropped if we receive it on the channel before knowing the
remote mask.

Since it is valid for a remote to send data this early, simply assume
that the channel is supported when we receive data on it. So far this
hasn't been noticed much because of limited use of fixed channels on
BR/EDR, but e.g. with SMP over BR/EDR this is already now visible with
automated tests failing randomly.
