hv: don't schedule new works in vmbus_onoffer()/vmbus_onoffer_rescind()

Since the 2 fucntions can safely run in vmbus_connection.work_queue without
hang, we don't need to schedule new work items into the per-channel workqueue.

Actally we can even remove the per-channel workqueue now -- we'll do it
in the next patch.
