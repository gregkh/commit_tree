    sparc64: Setup sysfs to mark LDOM sockets, cores and threads correctly

    The current sparc kernel has no representation for sockets though tools
    like lscpu can pull this from sysfs. This patch walks the machine
    description cache and socket hierarchy and marks sockets as well as cores
    and threads such that a representative sysfs is created by
    drivers/base/topology.c.

    Before this patch:
        $ lscpu
        Architecture:          sparc64
        CPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit
        Byte Order:            Big Endian
        CPU(s):                1024
        On-line CPU(s) list:   0-1023
        Thread(s) per core:    8
        Core(s) per socket:    1     <--- wrong
        Socket(s):             128   <--- wrong
        NUMA node(s):          4
        NUMA node0 CPU(s):     0-255
        NUMA node1 CPU(s):     256-511
        NUMA node2 CPU(s):     512-767
        NUMA node3 CPU(s):     768-1023

        After this patch:
        $ lscpu
        Architecture:          sparc64
        CPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit
        Byte Order:            Big Endian
        CPU(s):                1024
        On-line CPU(s) list:   0-1023
        Thread(s) per core:    8
        Core(s) per socket:    32
        Socket(s):             4
        NUMA node(s):          4
        NUMA node0 CPU(s):     0-255
        NUMA node1 CPU(s):     256-511
        NUMA node2 CPU(s):     512-767
        NUMA node3 CPU(s):     768-1023
