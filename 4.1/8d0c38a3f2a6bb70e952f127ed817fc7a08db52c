ASoC: Intel: move sysclk source setting to platform_clock_control for balance.

A playback noise happens after suspend/resume on Braswell. The issue is due to
the codec PLL and codec ASRC are not enabled correctly due to the incorrect
sysclk setting after resume. This patch resets the sysclk source setting in
platform clock control widget handler.
