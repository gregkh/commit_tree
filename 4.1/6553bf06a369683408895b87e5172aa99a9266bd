ASoC: Don't try to register debugfs entries if the parent does not exist

If the registration of a debugfs directory fails this is treated as a
non-fatal error in ASoC and operation continues as normal. This means we
need to be careful and check if the parent debugfs directory exists if we
try to register a debugfs file or sub-directory. Otherwise we might end up
passing NULL for the parent and the file or directory will be registered in
the top-level debugfs directory.
