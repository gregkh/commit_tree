serial: core: Add minor field to uart_port

UART drivers that share ttyS namespace cannot trivially compute the
ttyS index from the port->line value since the minor_start may be
offset from minor 64. Further, to do so requires a pointer to the
uart driver since there is no back pointer from uart_port to
uart_driver.

Rather than have UART drivers computing the minor value by themselves,
encapsulate within the serial core at port registration time.
