clocksource: Simplify the clocks_calc_max_nsecs() logic

The previous clocks_calc_max_nsecs() code had some unecessarily
complex bit logic to find the max interval that could cause
multiplication overflows. Since this is not in the hot
path, just do the divide to make it easier to read.

The previous implementation also had a subtle issue
that it avoided overflows with signed 64-bit values, where
as the intervals are always unsigned. This resulted in
overly conservative intervals, which other safety margins
were then added to, reducing the intended interval length.
