ALSA: core: reduce stack usage related to snd_ctl_new()

The callers of snd_ctl_new() need to have 'struct snd_kcontrol' data,
and pass the data as template. Then, the function allocates the structure
data again and copy from the template. This is a waste of resources.
Especially, the callers use large stack for the template.

This commit removes a need of template for the function, thus, changes
the prototype of snd_ctl_new(). Furthermore, this commit changes
the code of callers, snd_ctl_new1() and snd_ctl_elem_add() for better
shape.
