ARM OMAP2+ GPMC: fix WAITMONITORINGTIME divider bug

The WAITMONITORINGTIME is expressed as a number of GPMC_CLK clock cycles,
even though the access is defined as asynchronous, and no GPMC_CLK clock
is provided to the external device. Still, GPMCFCLKDIVIDER is used as a divider
for the GPMC clock, so it must be programmed to define the
correct WAITMONITORINGTIME delay.

This patch correctly computes WAITMONITORINGTIME in GPMC_CLK cycles instead of GPMC_FCLK cycles,
both during programming (gpmc_cs_set_timings) and during retrieval (gpmc_cs_show_timings).
