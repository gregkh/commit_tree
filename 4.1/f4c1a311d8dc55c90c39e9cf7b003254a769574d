ALSA: hda - only sync BCLK to the display clock for Haswell & Broadwell

Only Intel Haswell and Broadwell have a separate HD-A controller (PCI device 3)
for display audio, which needs to get 24MHz HD-A link BCLK from the variable
display core clock through vendor specific registers EM4 & EM5. Other platforms
(Baytrail, Braswell and Skylake) don't have this feature.

So this patch checks the PCI device ID of the controller in haswell_set_bclk()
and only sync BCLK for HSW and BDW.
