powerpc/perf/hv-24x7: Fail 24x7 initcall if create_events_from_catalog() fails

As Michael pointed out, create_events_from_catalog() fails when we
either have:
 - a kernel bug
 - some sort of hypervisor misconfiguration
 - ENOMEM

In all the above cases, we can also fail 24x7 initcall.

For hypervisor errors, EIO is used so there is something reported
in dmesg.
