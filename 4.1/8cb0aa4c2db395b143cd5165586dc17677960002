perf probe: Check the orphaned -x option

To avoid probing in unintended binary, the orphaned -x option must be
checked and warned.

Without this patch, following command sets up the probe in the kernel.

  -----
  # perf probe -a strcpy -x ./perf
  Added new event:
    probe:strcpy         (on strcpy)

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

          perf record -e probe:strcpy -aR sleep 1
  -----

But in this case, it seems that the user may want to probe in the perf
binary. With this patch, perf-probe correctly handles the orphaned -x.

  -----
  # perf probe -a strcpy -x ./perf
    Error: -x/-m must follow the probe definitions.
