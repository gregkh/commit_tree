be2net: avoid creating the non-RSS default RXQ if FW allows to

On BE2, BE3 and Skhawk-R chips one non-RSS (called "default") RXQ was
needed to receive non-IP traffic. Some FW versions now export a
capability called IFACE_FLAGS_DEFQ_RSS where this requirement doesn't hold.
On such FWs the driver now does not create the non-RSS default queue.
This prevents wasting one RXQ per VF.
