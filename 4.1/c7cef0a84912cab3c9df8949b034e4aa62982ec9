console: Add extensible console matching

Add match() method to struct console which allows the console to
perform console command line matching instead of (or in addition to)
default console matching (ie., by fixed name and index).

The match() method returns 0 to indicate a successful match; normal
console matching occurs if no match() method is defined or the
match() method returns non-zero. The match() method is expected to set
the console index if required.

Re-implement earlycon-to-console-handoff with direct matching of
"console=uart|uart8250,..." to the 8250 ttyS console.
