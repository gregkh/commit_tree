dm: remove request-based logic from make_request_fn wrapper

The old dm_request() method used for q->make_request_fn had a branch for
request-based DM support but it isn't needed given that
dm_init_request_based_queue() sets it to the standard blk_queue_bio()
anyway.

Cleanup dm_init_md_queue() to be DM device-type agnostic and have
dm_setup_md_queue() properly finish queue setup based on DM device-type
(bio-based vs request-based).

A followup block patch can be made to remove the export for
blk_queue_bio() now that DM no longer calls it directly.
