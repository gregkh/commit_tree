mtd: part: Remove partition overlap checks

This patch makes MTD dynamic partitioning more flexible by removing
overlap checks for dynamic partitions. I don't see any  particular
reason why overlapping dynamic partitions should be prohibited while
static partitions are allowed to overlap freely.

The checks previously had an off-by-one error, where 'end' should be
one less than what it is currently set at, and adding partitions out of
increasing order will fail. Disabling the checks resolves this issue.
