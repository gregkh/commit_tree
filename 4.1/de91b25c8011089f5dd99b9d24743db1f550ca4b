rhashtable: Eliminate unnecessary branch in rht_key_hashfn

When rht_key_hashfn is called from rhashtable itself and params
is equal to ht->p, there is no point in checking params.key_len
and falling back to ht->p.key_len.

For some reason gcc couldn't figure out that params is the same
as ht->p.  So let's help it by only checking params.key_len when
it's a constant.
