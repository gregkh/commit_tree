drm/i915: Reset logical ring contexts' head and tail during GPU reset

Work was getting left behind in LRC contexts during reset.  This causes a hang
if the GPU is reset when HEAD==TAIL because the context's ringbuffer head and
tail don't get reset and retiring a request doesn't alter them, so the ring
still appears full.

Added a function intel_lr_context_reset() to reset head and tail on a LRC and
its ringbuffer.

Call intel_lr_context_reset() for each context in i915_gem_context_reset() when
in execlists mode.

Testcase: igt/pm_rps --run-subtest reset #bdw
