x86_64, asm: Work around AMD SYSRET SS descriptor attribute issue

AMD CPUs don't reinitialize the SS descriptor on SYSRET, so SYSRET with
SS == 0 results in an invalid usermode state in which SS is apparently
equal to __USER_DS but causes #SS if used.

Work around the issue by setting SS to __KERNEL_DS __switch_to, thus
ensuring that SYSRET never happens with SS set to NULL.

This was exposed by a recent vDSO cleanup.

Fixes: e7d6eefaaa44 x86/vdso32/syscall.S: Do not load __USER32_DS to %ss
