clocksource: Simplify the logic around clocksource wrapping safety margins

The clocksource logic has a number of places where we try to
include a safety margin. Most of these are 12% safety margins,
but they are inconsistently applied and sometimes are applied
on top of each other.

Additionally, in the previous patch, we corrected an issue
where we unintentionally in effect created a 50% safety margin,
which these 12.5% margins where then added to.

So to simplify the logic here, this patch removes the various
12.5% margins, and consolidates adding the margin in one place:
clocks_calc_max_nsecs().

Additionally, Linus prefers a 50% safety margin, as it allows
bad clock values to be more easily caught. This should really
have no net effect, due to the corrected issue earlier which
caused greater then 50% margins to be used w/o issue.
