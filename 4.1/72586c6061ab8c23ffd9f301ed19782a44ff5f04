n_tty: Fix auditing support for cannonical mode

Commit 32f13521ca68bc624ff6effc77f308a52b038bf0
("n_tty: Line copy to user buffer in canonical mode")
changed cannonical mode copying to use copy_to_user
but missed adding the call to the audit framework.
Add in the appropriate functions to get audit support.
