regulator: output current-limit for all regulators in summary

Voltage regulators can have (unregulated) current limits too, so we should
probably output both voltage and current for all regulators.

Holding the rdev->mutex actually conflicts with _regulator_get_current_limit
but also is not really necessary, as the global regulator_list_mutex already
protects us from the regulator vanishing while we go through the list.

On the rk3288-firefly the summary now looks like:

 regulator                      use open bypass voltage current     min     max
