staging: gdm72xx: Condense two statements into one to improve code readability.

This patch removes a variable assignmnet to a value, used only
for returning that value. The following coccinelle script was
used to discover it:

@@
expression ret;
identifier f;
@@

-ret =
+return
     f(...);
     -return ret;
