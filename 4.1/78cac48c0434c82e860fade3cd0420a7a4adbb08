x86/mm/KASLR: Propagate KASLR status to kernel proper

Commit:

  e2b32e678513 ("x86, kaslr: randomize module base load address")

made module base address randomization unconditional and didn't regard
disabled KKASLR due to CONFIG_HIBERNATION and command line option
"nokaslr". For more info see (now reverted) commit:

  f47233c2d34f ("x86/mm/ASLR: Propagate base load address calculation")

In order to propagate KASLR status to kernel proper, we need a single bit
in boot_params.hdr.loadflags and we've chosen bit 1 thus leaving the
top-down allocated bits for bits supposed to be used by the bootloader.
