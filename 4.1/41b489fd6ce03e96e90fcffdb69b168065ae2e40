fib_trie: move leaf and tnode to occupy the same spot in the key vector

If we are going to compact the leaf and tnode we first need to make sure
the fields are all in the same place.  In that regard I am moving the leaf
pointer which represents the fib_alias hash list to occupy what is
currently the first key_vector pointer.
