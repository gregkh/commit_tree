serial/amba-pl011: Leave the TX IRQ alone when the UART is not open

Getting the TX IRQ re-asserted from scratch can be inefficient in
some setups.

This patch avoids clearing the TX IRQ across pl011_shutdown()...
pl011_startup(), so that if the port is closed and reopened, the
IRQ will still work afterwards without having to bootstrap it again.

The TX IRQ continues to be masked in IMSC when the UART is not in
use.
