Drivers: hv: hv_balloon: eliminate jumps in piecewiese linear floor function

Commit 79208c57da53 ("Drivers: hv: hv_balloon: Make adjustments in computing
the floor") was inacurate as it introduced a jump in our piecewiese linear
'floor' function:

At 2048MB we have:
Left limit:
104 + 2048/8 = 360
Right limit:
256 + 2048/16 = 384 (so the right value is 232)

We now have to make an adjustment at 8192 boundary:
232 + 8192/16 = 744
512 + 8192/32 = 768 (so the right value is 488)
