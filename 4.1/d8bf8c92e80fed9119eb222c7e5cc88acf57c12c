sysfs: Only accept read/write permissions for file attributes

For sysfs file attributes, only read and write permissions make sense.
Mask provided attribute permissions accordingly and send a warning
to the console if invalid permission bits are set.

This patch is originally from Guenter [1] and includes the fixup
explained in the thread, that is printing permissions in octal format
and limiting the scope of attributes to SYSFS_PREALLOC | 0664.
