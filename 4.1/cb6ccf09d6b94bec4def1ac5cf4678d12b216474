route: Use ipv4_mtu instead of raw rt_pmtu

The commit 3cdaa5be9e81a914e633a6be7b7d2ef75b528562 ("ipv4: Don't
increase PMTU with Datagram Too Big message") broke PMTU in cases
where the rt_pmtu value has expired but is smaller than the new
PMTU value.

This obsolete rt_pmtu then prevents the new PMTU value from being
installed.
