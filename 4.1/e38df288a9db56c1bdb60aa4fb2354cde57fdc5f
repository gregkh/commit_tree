MIPS: idle: Workaround wait + FDC problems

On certain cores (namely proAptiv and P5600) incoming data via a Fast
Debug Channel (FDC) while the core is blocked on a wait instruction will
cause the wait not to wake up even when another interrupt is received.
This makes an idle target stop as soon as you send FDC data to it, until
the debug probe interrupts it and restarts the wait instruction.

This is worked around by avoiding using r4k_wait on these cores if
CONFIG_MIPS_EJTAG_FDC_TTY is enabled (which would imply the user intends
to use the FDC).
