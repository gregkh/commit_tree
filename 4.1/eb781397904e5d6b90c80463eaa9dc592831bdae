r8169: Do not use dev_kfree_skb in xmit path

The function r8169_csum_workaround is called in the ndo_start_xmit path of
the r8169 driver.  As such it should not be using dev_kfree_skb as it is
not irq safe, so instead we should be using dev_kfree_skb_any for freeing
in the dropped path, and dev_consume_skb_any for any frames that were
transmitted.
