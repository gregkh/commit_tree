ARM: dts: am437x-sk: fix for new newhaven display module revision

AM437x Starter Kit uses a NewHaven Display module with
a 4.3" display and EDT FT5306 touchscreen

On that module's new revision, NewHave decided to change
the pinout on the 6 pin flat-pcb touchscreen connector so
that instead of having WAKE pin, we now have RESETn.

The new display module is available on AM437x SK Beta and
all new revisions while the older revision is only available
on AM437x SK Alpha which, unfortunately, can't be supported
anymore in mainline without a revert of this patch.
