xfs: pass attr geometry to attr leaf header conversion functions

The firstused field of the xfs_attr3_leaf_hdr structure is subject to an
overflow when fs blocksize is 64k. In preparation to handle this
overflow in the header conversion functions, pass the attribute geometry
to the functions that convert the in-core structure to and from the
on-disk structure.
