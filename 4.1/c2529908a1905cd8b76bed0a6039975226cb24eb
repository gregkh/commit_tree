[media] sur40: fix occasional hard freeze due to buffer queue underrun

This patch fixes a kernel panic which occurs when buf_list is empty. This can
happen occasionally when user space is under heavy load (e.g. due to image
processing on the CPU) and new buffers aren't re-queued fast enough. In that
case, vb2_start_streaming_called can return true, but when the spinlock
is taken and sur40_poll attempts to fetch the next buffer from buf_list, the
list is in fact empty.

This patch needs to be applied on top of the queued one adding V4L2 support
to the sur40 driver.
