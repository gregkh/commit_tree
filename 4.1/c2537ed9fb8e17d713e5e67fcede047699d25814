MIPS: KVM: Add MSA exception handling

Add guest exception handling for MIPS SIMD Architecture (MSA) floating
point exceptions and MSA disabled exceptions.

MSA floating point exceptions from the guest need passing to the guest
kernel, so for these a guest MSAFPE is emulated.

MSA disabled exceptions are normally handled by passing a reserved
instruction exception to the guest (because no guest MSA was supported),
but the hypervisor can now handle them if the guest has MSA by passing
an MSA disabled exception to the guest, or if the guest has MSA enabled
by transparently restoring the guest MSA context and enabling MSA and
the FPU.
