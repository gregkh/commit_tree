ARM64 / ACPI: Introduce early_param "acpi=" to enable/disable ACPI

This implements the following policy to decide whether ACPI should
be used to boot the system:
- acpi=off: ACPI will not be used to boot the system, even if there is
  no alternative available (e.g., device tree is empty)
- acpi=force: only ACPI will be used to boot the system; if that fails,
  there will be no fallback to alternative methods (such as device tree)
- otherwise, ACPI will be used as a fallback if the device tree turns out
  to lack a platform description; the heuristic to decide this is whether
  /chosen is the only node present at depth 1
