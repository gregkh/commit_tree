MAINTAINERS: Add Pratyush Anand as SPEAr13xx and DesignWare PCIe maintainer

Didn't add myself as Maintainer earlier, as I was moving out of ST
and didn't had a board to test. But learnt recently that, it's fine being
in MAINTAINERS in such situations, at least I can review the patches.

So, let me add myself.
