KVM: introduce kvm_arch_intc_initialized and use it in irqfd

Introduce __KVM_HAVE_ARCH_INTC_INITIALIZED define and
associated kvm_arch_intc_initialized function. This latter
allows to test whether the virtual interrupt controller is initialized
and ready to accept virtual IRQ injection. On some architectures,
the virtual interrupt controller is dynamically instantiated, justifying
that kind of check.

The new function can now be used by irqfd to check whether the
virtual interrupt controller is ready on KVM_IRQFD request. If not,
KVM_IRQFD returns -EAGAIN.
