Btrfs: btrfs_release_extent_buffer_page didn't free pages of dummy extent

btrfs_release_extent_buffer_page() can't handle dummy extent that
allocated by btrfs_clone_extent_buffer() properly. That is because
reference count of pages that allocated by btrfs_clone_extent_buffer()
was 2, 1 by alloc_page(), and another by attach_extent_buffer_page().

Running following command repeatly can check this memory leak problem

    btrfs inspect-internal inode-resolve 256 /mnt/btrfs
