cpumask_set_cpu_local_first => cpumask_local_spread, lament

da91309e0a7e (cpumask: Utility function to set n'th cpu...) created a
genuinely weird function.  I never saw it before, it went through DaveM.
(He only does this to make us other maintainers feel better about our own
mistakes.)

cpumask_set_cpu_local_first's purpose is say "I need to spread things
across N online cpus, choose the ones on this numa node first"; you call
it in a loop.

It can fail.  One of the two callers ignores this, the other aborts and
fails the device open.

It can fail in two ways: allocating the off-stack cpumask, or through a
convoluted codepath which AFAICT can only occur if cpu_online_mask
changes.  Which shouldn't happen, because if cpu_online_mask can change
while you call this, it could return a now-offline cpu anyway.

It contains a nonsensical test "!cpumask_of_node(numa_node)".  This was
drawn to my attention by Geert, who said this causes a warning on Sparc.
It sets a single bit in a cpumask instead of returning a cpu number,
because that's what the callers want.

It could be made more efficient by passing the previous cpu rather than
an index, but that would be more invasive to the callers.
