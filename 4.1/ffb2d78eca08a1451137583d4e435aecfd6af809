powerpc/mce: fix off by one errors in mce event handling

Before 69111bac42f5 ("powerpc: Replace __get_cpu_var uses"), in
save_mce_event, index got the value of mce_nest_count, and
mce_nest_count was incremented *after* index was set.

However, that patch changed the behaviour so that mce_nest count was
incremented *before* setting index.

This causes an off-by-one error, as get_mce_event sets index as
mce_nest_count - 1 before reading mce_event.  Thus get_mce_event reads
bogus data, causing warnings like
"Machine Check Exception, Unknown event version 0 !"
and breaking MCEs handling.

Restore the old behaviour and unbreak MCE handling by subtracting one
from the newly incremented value.

The same broken change occured in machine_check_queue_event (which set
a queue read by machine_check_process_queued_event).  Fix that too,
unbreaking printing of MCE information.
