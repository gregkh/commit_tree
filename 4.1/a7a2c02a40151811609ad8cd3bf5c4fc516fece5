lib/dma-debug: fix bucket_find_contain()

bucket_find_contain() will search the bucket list for a dma_debug_entry.
When the entry isn't found it needs to search other buckets too, since
only the start address of a dma range is hashed (which might be in a
different bucket).

A copy of the dma_debug_entry is used to get the previous hash bucket
but when its list is searched the original dma_debug_entry is to be used
not its modified copy.

This fixes false "device driver tries to sync DMA memory it has not allocated"
warnings.
