drivers/tty: serial: remove info message

Unacceptable levels of debug info will happen when the DMA driver defined in
the DT/ACPI is a blacklisted module.

Another cause for log polution would be the defer probing of the DMA driver
taking too long - in which case the message that this commit removes would be
cluttering the logs due to the init daemons activity.
