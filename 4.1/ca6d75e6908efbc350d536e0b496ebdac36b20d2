sched: Add struct rq::cpu_capacity_orig

This new field 'cpu_capacity_orig' reflects the original capacity of a CPU
before being altered by rt tasks and/or IRQ

The cpu_capacity_orig will be used:

  - to detect when the capacity of a CPU has been noticeably reduced so we can
    trig load balance to look for a CPU with better capacity. As an example, we
    can detect when a CPU handles a significant amount of irq
    (with CONFIG_IRQ_TIME_ACCOUNTING) but this CPU is seen as an idle CPU by
    scheduler whereas CPUs, which are really idle, are available.

  - evaluate the available capacity for CFS tasks
