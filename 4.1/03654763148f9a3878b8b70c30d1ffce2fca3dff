ppp: mppe: discard late packet in stateless mode

When PPP is used over a link which does not guarantee packet ordering,
we might get late MPPE packets. This is a problem because MPPE must be
kept synchronized and the current implementation does not drop them and
rekey 4095 times instead of 0, which is wrong.

In order to prevent rekeying about a whole count space times (~ 4095
times), drop packets which are not within the forward 4096/2 window and
increase sanity error counter.
