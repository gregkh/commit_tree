tools lib traceevent: Zero should not be considered "not found" in eval_flag()

Guilherme Cox found that:

 There is, however, a potential bug if there is an item with code zero
 that is not the first one in the symbol list, since eval_flag(..)
 returns 0 when it doesn't find anything.

That is, if you have the following enums:

enum {
  FOO_START = 0,
  FOO_GO    = 1,
  FOO_END   = 2
}

and then have:

  __print_symbolic(foo, FOO_GO, "go", FOO_START, "start",
		        FOO_END, "end")

If none of the enums are known to pevent, then eval_flag() will return
zero, and it will match it to the first item in the list, which would be
FOO_GO, which is not zero.

Luckily, in most cases, the first element would be zero, and the parsing
would match out of sheer luck.
