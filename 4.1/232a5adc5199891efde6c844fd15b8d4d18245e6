spi: bitbang: only toggle bitchanges

The current implementation of bitbang_txrx_be_cpha0 and
bitbang_txrx_be_cpha1 always call setmosi. That runs into several
unnecessary calls into the gpiolib when the level of the GPIO actually
has not to be changed.

This patch changes the routines to remember the last GPIO level
and only calls setmosi if an change has to be made. This
way it improves the transfer throughput.
