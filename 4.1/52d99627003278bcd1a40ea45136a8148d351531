powerpc: kill PPC_OF

We have set CONFIG_PPC_OF to always 'y' in commit 0a498d96a332
("powerpc: set CONFIG_PPC_OF=y always for ARCH=powerpc") nine years
ago. And the arch/ppc also has gone away for many years. The OF
functionality was also moved to a common place and be used by many
archs. So it does make no sense to keep such a option in the current
kernel. Just kill it.
