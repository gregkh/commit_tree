staging: comedi: adl_pci6208: support old PLX device ID

ADLINK's MS Windows drivers for the PCI-6208/6216 boards include the
following line in the DDInstall secion of the INF file:

%String6208%=DriverInstall6208.NT,PCI\VEN_10B5&DEV_9050&SUBSYS_62089999

That's for a PLX PCI 9050/9052 PCI interface chip with custom subvendor
and subdevice ID.  The "%String6208%" macro expands to "ADLINK PCI-6208"
in the INF file.

Add a corresponding entry to this driver module's PCI device table.
