make RAM device optional

Having a RAM device does not make sense for chips like GK20A which have
no dedicated video memory. The dummy RAM device that we used so far
works as a temporary band-aid, but in the longer term it is desirable
for the driver to be able to work without any kind of VRAM.

This patch adds a few conditionals in places where a RAM device was
assumed to be present and allows some more objects to be allocated from
the TT domain, allowing Nouveau to handle GPUs for which
pfb->ram == NULL.
