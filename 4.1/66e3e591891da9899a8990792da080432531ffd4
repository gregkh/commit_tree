usb: Add driver for Altus Metrum ChaosKey device (v2)

This is a hardware random number generator. The driver provides both a
/dev/chaoskeyX entry and hooks the entropy source up to the kernel
hwrng interface. More information about the device can be found at
http://chaoskey.org

The USB ID for ChaosKey was allocated from the OpenMoko USB vendor
space and is visible as 'USBtrng' here:

v2: Respond to review from Oliver Neukum <oneukum@suse.de>

 * Delete extensive debug infrastructure and replace it with calls to
   dev_dbg.

 * Allocate I/O buffer separately from device structure to obey
   requirements for non-coherant architectures.

 * Initialize mutexes before registering device to ensure that open
   cannot be invoked before the device is ready to proceed.

 * Return number of bytes read instead of -EINTR when partial read
   operation is aborted due to a signal.

 * Make sure device mutex is unlocked in read error paths.

 * Add MAINTAINERS entry for the driver
