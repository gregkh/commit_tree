irqchip: gic: Add an entry point to set up irqchip flags

A common use of gic_arch_extn is to set up additional flags
to the GIC irqchip. It looks like a benign enough hack that
doesn't really require the users of that feature to be converted
to stacked domains.

Add a gic_set_irqchip_flags() function that platform code can
call instead of using the dreaded gic_arch_extn.
