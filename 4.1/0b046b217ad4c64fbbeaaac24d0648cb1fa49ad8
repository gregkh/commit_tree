clocksource: Improve clocksource watchdog reporting

The clocksource watchdog reporting has been less helpful
then desired, as it just printed the delta between
the two clocksources. This prevents any useful analysis
of why the skew occurred.

Thus this patch tries to improve the output when we
mark a clocksource as unstable, printing out the cycle
last and now values for both the current clocksource
and the watchdog clocksource. This will allow us to see
if the result was due to a false positive caused by
a problematic watchdog.
