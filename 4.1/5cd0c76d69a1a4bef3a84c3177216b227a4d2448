bq27x00_battery: register as non-wakeup power supply.

power_supply status changes for the bq27x00 are only
noticed via polling, not via interrupts.  So they are never
the source of events which should reliably wake the system
from suspend.
So it is appropriate to register as a no_ws power source,
just like the ACPI battery.

This removes some debugging messages which occasionally
confusingly identify bq27x00 as a wakeup source.
