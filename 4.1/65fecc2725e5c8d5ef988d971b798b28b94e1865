MIPS: Netlogic: Use MIPS topology.h

commit bda4584cd943 ("MIPS: Support CPU topology files in sysfs")
added topology related macros for all MIPS platforms and commit
bbbf6d8768f5 ("MIPS: NL: Fix nlm_xlp_defconfig build error")
removed most of the contents from mach-netlogic/topology.h.

The netlogic specific topology is not needed anymore, we just need
to setup the package field in current_cpu_data.
