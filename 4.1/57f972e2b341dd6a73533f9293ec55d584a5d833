vfio/platform: trigger an interrupt via eventfd

This patch allows to set an eventfd for a platform device's interrupt,
and also to trigger the interrupt eventfd from userspace for testing.
Level sensitive interrupts are marked as maskable and are handled in
a later patch. Edge triggered interrupts are not advertised as maskable
and are implemented here using a simple and efficient IRQ handler.
