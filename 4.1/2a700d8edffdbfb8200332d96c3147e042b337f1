[media] marvell-ccic: fix Y'CbCr ordering

Various formats had their byte ordering implemented incorrectly, and
the V4L2_PIX_FMT_UYVY is actually impossible to create, instead you
get V4L2_PIX_FMT_YVYU.

This was working before commit ad6ac452227b7cb93ac79beec092850d178740b1
("add new formats support for marvell-ccic driver"). That commit broke
the original format support and the OLPC XO-1 laptop showed wrong
colors ever since (if you are crazy enough to attempt to run the latest
kernel on it, like I did).

The email addresses of the authors of that patch are no longer valid,
so without a way to reach them and ask them about their test setup
I am going with what I can test on the OLPC laptop.

If this breaks something for someone on their non-OLPC setup, then
contact the linux-media mailinglist. My suspicion however is that
that commit went in untested.
