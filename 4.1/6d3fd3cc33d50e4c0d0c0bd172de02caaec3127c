ACPICA: Utilities: Cleanup to enforce ACPI_PHYSADDR_TO_PTR()/ACPI_PTR_TO_PHYSADDR().

ACPICA commit 154f6d074dd38d6ebc0467ad454454e6c5c9ecdf

There are code pieces converting pointers using "(acpi_physical_address) x"
or "ACPI_CAST_PTR (t, x)" formats, this patch cleans up them.

Known issues:
1. Cleanup of "(ACPI_PHYSICAL_ADDRRESS) x" for a table field
   For the conversions around the table fields, it is better to fix it with
   alignment also fixed. So this patch doesn't modify such code. There
   should be no functional problem by leaving them unchanged.
