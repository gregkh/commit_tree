KVM: x86: simplify kvm_apic_map

recalculate_apic_map() uses two passes over all VCPUs.  This is a relic
from time when we selected a global mode in the first pass and set up
the optimized table in the second pass (to have a consistent mode).

Recent changes made mixed mode unoptimized and we can do it in one pass.
Format of logical MDA is a function of the mode, so we encode it in
apic_logical_id() and drop obsoleted variables from the struct.
