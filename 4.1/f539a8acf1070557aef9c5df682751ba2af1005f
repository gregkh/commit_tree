drivers/rtc/rtc-hym8563.c: fix swapped enable/disable of clockout control bit

The hym8563 datasheet describes the clock output control-bit as "when set
to logic 0, the square wave output is enable, when set to logic 1, the
CLKOUT output is inhibited".  But in reality the setting is exactly
opposite.

Before now, the clock output was not really used, but on the rk3288 soc
this generated clock is used to supply the temperature sensor block and
the swapped bit value prevented it from working.  With the corrected
value, the tsadc now reports correct values.
