xfs: use i_mmaplock on write faults

Take the i_mmaplock over write page faults. These come through the
->page_mkwrite callout, so we need to wrap that calls with the
i_mmaplock.

This gives us a lock order of mmap_sem -> i_mmaplock -> page_lock
-> i_lock.

Also, move the page_mkwrite wrapper to the same region of xfs_file.c
as the read fault wrappers and add a tracepoint.
