checkpatch: add optional --codespell dictionary to find more typos

If a codespell dictionary exists, use it if desired.  default is off,
maybe it could be turned on later.

codespell's dictionary format allows multiple possible corrections, ignore
that for now and only use the first suggestion.

Also add \b to spelling test so that consecutive misspelled words
are found properly.
