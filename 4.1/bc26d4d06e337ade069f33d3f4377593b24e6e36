sound/oss: fix deadlock in sequencer_ioctl(SNDCTL_SEQ_OUTOFBAND)

A deadlock can be initiated by userspace via ioctl(SNDCTL_SEQ_OUTOFBAND)
on /dev/sequencer with TMR_ECHO midi event.

In this case the control flow is:
sound_ioctl()
-> case SND_DEV_SEQ:
   case SND_DEV_SEQ2:
     sequencer_ioctl()
     -> case SNDCTL_SEQ_OUTOFBAND:
          spin_lock_irqsave(&lock,flags);
          play_event();
          -> case EV_TIMING:
               seq_timing_event()
               -> case TMR_ECHO:
                    seq_copy_to_input()
                    -> spin_lock_irqsave(&lock,flags);

It seems that spin_lock_irqsave() around play_event() is not necessary,
because the only other call location in seq_startplay() makes the call
without acquiring spinlock.

So, the patch just removes spinlocks around play_event().
By the way, it removes unreachable code in seq_timing_event(),
since (seq_mode == SEQ_2) case is handled in the beginning.

Compile tested only.
