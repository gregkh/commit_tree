vfio/platform: return info for bound device

A VFIO userspace driver will start by opening the VFIO device
that corresponds to an IOMMU group, and will use the ioctl interface
to get the basic device info, such as number of memory regions and
interrupts, and their properties. This patch enables the
VFIO_DEVICE_GET_INFO ioctl call.
