staging: comedi: cb_pcimdas: fix analog input channel configuration

The hardware uses a switch on the board to set the number of analog
input channels to either 16 single-ended or 8 differential channels.
Currently the switch setting is checked for every (*insn_read) operation
to validate the channel number.

Check the switch setting during the driver attach and initialize the
subdevice accordingly. This allows the core to handle the validation.
