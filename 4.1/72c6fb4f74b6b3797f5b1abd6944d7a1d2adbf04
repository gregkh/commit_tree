x86/ia32-compat: Fix CLONE_SETTLS bitness of copy_thread()

CLONE_SETTLS is expected to write a TLS entry in the GDT for
32-bit callers and to set FSBASE for 64-bit callers.

The correct check is is_ia32_task(), which returns true in the
context of a 32-bit syscall.  TIF_IA32 is set if the task itself
has a 32-bit personality, which is not the same thing.
