tcp: RFC7413 option support for Fast Open server

Fast Open has been using the experimental option with a magic number
(RFC6994) to request and grant Fast Open cookies. This patch enables
the server to support the official IANA option 34 in RFC7413 in
addition.

The change has passed all existing Fast Open tests with both
old and new options at Google.
