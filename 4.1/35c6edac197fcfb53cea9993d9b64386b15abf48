fib_trie: Rename tnode to key_vector

Rename the tnode to key_vector.  The key_vector will be the eventual
container for all of the information needed by either a leaf or a tnode.
The final result should be much smaller than the 40 bytes currently needed
for either one.

This also updates the trie struct so that it contains an array of size 1 of
tnode pointers.  This is to bring the structure more inline with how an
actual tnode itself is configured.
