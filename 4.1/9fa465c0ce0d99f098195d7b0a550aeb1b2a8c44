be2net: remove code duplication relating to Lancer reset sequence

The steps needed for Lancer's reset/initialization sequence are:
	a) wait for SLIPORT_STAUS RDY bit to be set
	b) set the SLIPORT_CONTROL IP bit
	c) repeat step "a"

The code needed for this sequence is already covered by the be_func_init()
routine (with minor modifications.) So, get rid of the
lancer_test_and_set_rdy_state() and lancer_provisioning_error() routines
that unnecessarily duplicate this code. Also fixed the error recovery
function to take care of these changes
