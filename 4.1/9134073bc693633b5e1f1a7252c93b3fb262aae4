mac80211: improve Minstrel variable & function naming

This patch ensures a consistent usage of variable names for type
"minstrel_rate_stats" to be used as "mrs" and from type minstrel_rate
as "mr" across both Minstrel & Minstrel-HT. In addition some
variable and function names got changed to more meaningful ones.
