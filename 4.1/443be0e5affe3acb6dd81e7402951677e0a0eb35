RDS: make sure not to loop forever inside rds_send_xmit

If a determined set of concurrent senders keep the send queue full,
we can loop forever inside rds_send_xmit.  This fix has two parts.

First we are dropping out of the while(1) loop after we've processed a
large batch of messages.

Second we add a generation number that gets bumped each time the
xmit bit lock is acquired.  If someone else has jumped in and
made progress in the queue, we skip our goto restart.
