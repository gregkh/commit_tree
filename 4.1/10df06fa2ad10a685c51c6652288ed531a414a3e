fm10k: only increment tx_timeout_count in Tx hang path

We were incrementing the tx_timeout_count for both the Tx hang
and then for all reset flows.  Instead, we should only increment
tx_timeout_count in the Tx hang path, so that our Tx hang counter
does not increment when it was not caused by a Tx hang.
