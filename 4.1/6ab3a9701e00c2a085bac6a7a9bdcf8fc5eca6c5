checkpatch: improve "no space is necessary after a cast" test

The "no space is necessary after a cast" sizeof exclusion doesn't work
properly.

The test reports a false positive for code like:

	BUILD_BUG_ON(sizeof(struct batadv_bla_claim_dst) != 6);

Make it work, simplify the exclusions, and add some comments.
