ACPI / video: Add force native backlight quirk for Lenovo Ideapad Z570

The Lenovo Ideapad Z570 (which is an Acer in disguise like some other Ideapads)
has a broken acpi_video interface, this was fixed in commmit a11d342fb8
("ACPI / video: force vendor backlight on Lenovo Ideapad Z570").

Which stops acpi_video from registering a backlight interface, but this is
only a partial fix, because for people who have the ideapad-laptop module
installed that module will now register a backlight interface, which also
does not work, so we need to use the native intel_backlight interface.

The Lenovo Ideapad 570 is a pre-win8 laptop / too old for the acpi-video code
to automatically prefer the native backlight interface, so add a quirk for it.

This commit also removes the previous incomplete fix.
