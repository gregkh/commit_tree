md-raid0: conditional mddev->queue access to suit dm-raid

This patch is a prerequisite for dm-raid "raid0" support to allow
dm-raid to access the MD RAID0 personality doing unconditional
accesses to mddev->queue, which is NULL in case of dm-raid stacked on
top of MD.

Most of the conditional mddev->queue accesses made it to upstream but
this missing one, which prohibits md raid0 to set disk stack limits
(being done in dm core in case of md underneath dm).
