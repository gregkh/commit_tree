Btrfs: don't use highmem for free space cache pages

In order to create the free space cache concurrently with FS modifications,
we need to take a few block group locks.

The cache code also does kmap, which would schedule with the locks held.
Instead of going through kmap_atomic, lets just use lowmem for the cache
pages.
