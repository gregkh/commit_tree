usb: make module xhci_hcd removable

Fixed regression. After commit 29e409f0f761 ("xhci: Allow xHCI drivers to
be built as separate modules") the module xhci_hcd became non-removable.
That behaviour is not expected and there're no notes about it in commit
message. The module should be removable as it blocks PM suspend/resume
functions (Debian Bug#666406).
