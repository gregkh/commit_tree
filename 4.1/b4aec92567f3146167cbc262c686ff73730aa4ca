KVM: s390: cpu timer irq priority

We now have a mechanism for delivering interrupts according to their priority.

Let's inject them using our new infrastructure (instead of letting only hardware
handle them), so we can be sure that the irq priorities are satisfied.

For s390, the cpu timer and the clock comparator are to be checked for common
code kvm_cpu_has_pending_timer(), although the cpu timer is only stepped when
the guest is being executed.
