mm: rename FOLL_MLOCK to FOLL_POPULATE

After commit a1fde08c74e9 ("VM: skip the stack guard page lookup in
get_user_pages only for mlock") FOLL_MLOCK has lost its original
meaning: we don't necessarily mlock the page if the flags is set -- we
also take VM_LOCKED into consideration.

Since we use the same codepath for __mm_populate(), let's rename
FOLL_MLOCK to FOLL_POPULATE.
