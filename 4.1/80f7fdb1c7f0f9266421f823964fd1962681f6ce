x86: vdso: fix pvclock races with task migration

If we were migrated right after __getcpu, but before reading the
migration_count, we wouldn't notice that we read TSC of a different
VCPU, nor that KVM's bug made pvti invalid, as only migration_count
on source VCPU is increased.

Change vdso instead of updating migration_count on destination.
