clk: at91: usb: propagate rate modification to the parent clk

The at91sam9n12 and at91sam9x5 usb clocks do not propagate rate
modification requests to their parents.
This causes a bug when the PLLB is left uninitialized by the bootloader
(PLL multiplier set to 0, or in other words, PLL rate = 0 Hz).

Implement the determinate_rate method and propagate the change rate
request to the parent clk.
