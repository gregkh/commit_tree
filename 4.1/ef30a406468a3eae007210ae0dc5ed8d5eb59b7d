Input: cros_ec_keyb - fix clearing keyboard state on wakeup

As the comment right before explains, the keyboard state is to be cleared
only if the EC wasn't a wakeup source in the last suspend.

Without this commit, there's an unneeded delay when resuming from suspend
and we also lose the key that was pressed while suspended.
