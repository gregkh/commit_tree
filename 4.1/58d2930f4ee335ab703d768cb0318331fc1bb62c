KVM: Eliminate extra function calls in kvm_get_dirty_log_protect()

When all bits in mask are not set,
kvm_arch_mmu_enable_log_dirty_pt_masked() has nothing to do.  But since
it needs to be called from the generic code, it cannot be inlined, and
a few function calls, two when PML is enabled, are wasted.

Since it is common to see many pages remain clean, e.g. framebuffers can
stay calm for a long time, it is worth eliminating this overhead.
