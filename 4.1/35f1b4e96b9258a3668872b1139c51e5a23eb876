ipv6: do not delete previously existing ECMP routes if add fails

If adding a nexthop of an IPv6 multipath route fails, comment in
ip6_route_multipath() says we are going to delete all nexthops already
added. However, current implementation deletes even the routes it
hasn't even tried to add yet. For example, running

  ip route add 1234:5678::/64 \
      nexthop via fe80::aa dev dummy1 \
      nexthop via fe80::bb dev dummy1 \
      nexthop via fe80::cc dev dummy1

twice results in removing all routes first command added.

Limit the second (delete) run to nexthops that succeeded in the first
(add) run.
