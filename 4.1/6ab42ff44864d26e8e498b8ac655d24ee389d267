ALSA: hda - adding a DAC/pin preference map for a HP Envy TS machine

On a HP Envy TouchSmart laptop, there are 2 speakers (main speaker
and subwoofer speaker), 1 headphone and 2 DACs, without this fixup,
the headphone will be assigned to a DAC and the 2 speakers will be
assigned to another DAC, this assignment makes the surround-2.1
channels invalid.

To fix it, here using a DAC/pin preference map to bind the main
speaker to 1 DAC and the subwoofer speaker will be assigned to another
DAC.
