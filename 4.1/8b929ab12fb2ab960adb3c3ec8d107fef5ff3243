inet: remove some sk_listener dependencies

listener can be source of false sharing. request sock has some
useful information like : ireq->ir_iif, ireq->ir_num, ireq->ireq_net

This patch does not solve the major problem of having to read
sk->sk_protocol which is sharing a cache line with sk->sk_wmem_alloc.
(This same field is read later in ip_build_and_send_pkt())

One idea would be to move sk_protocol close to sk_family
(using 8 bits instead of 16 for sk_family seems enough)
