KVM: x86: cleanup kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic_fast

Sparse is reporting a "we previously assumed 'src' could be null" error.
This is true as far as the static analyzer can see, but in practice only
IPIs can set shorthand to self and they also set 'src', so it's ok.
Still, move the initialization of x2apic_ipi (and thus the NULL check for
src right before the first use.

While at it, initializing ret to "false" is somewhat confusing because of
the almost immediate assigned of "true" to the same variable.  Thus,
initialize it to "true" and modify it in the only path that used to use
the value from "bool ret = false".  There is no change in generated code
from this change.
