Input: atmel_mxt_ts - split out touchpad initialisation logic

If the "linux,gpio-keymap" DT property is defined, the T19 keys are
configured and the device is setup as a touchpad rather than a touchscreen.
The logic is part of the input device initialization routine but it can be
factored out to its own function to simplify the former.
