fib_trie: Make fib_table rcu safe

The fib_table was wrapped in several places with an
rcu_read_lock/rcu_read_unlock however after looking over the code I found
several spots where the tables were being accessed as just standard
pointers without any protections.  This change fixes that so that all of
the proper protections are in place when accessing the table to take RCU
replacement or removal of the table into account.
