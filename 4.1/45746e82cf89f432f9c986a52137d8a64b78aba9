spi: dw: make sure SPI controller is enabled

The error handling is partially broken since the controller is disabled on
error and is not re-enabled until condition occurs, i.e. mode (poll, PIO/DMA),
chip (cs_change), or speed (clk_div) is changed. In the result of these changes
we will have a predictable state of the SPi controller independently on how
successfull was a previous transfer.

The patch disables interrupts and re-enables the SPI controller wherever it
needs to be done. Thus most of the time the SPI controller is kept enabled. The
runtime PM, when it will be implemented, must take care of the controller
disabling and re-enabling.
