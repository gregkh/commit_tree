MIPS: mipsregs.h: Reorder CP1 macro definitions

Originally CP1 macros were placed between CP0 register name macros and
CP0 register value macros.  As changes were applied to the header the
position of CP1 macros gradually has become more and more arbitrary and
two separate blocks were created.  This may only cause confusion.

Move them out of the way then and place together after all the CP0
macros.  No semantic change.
