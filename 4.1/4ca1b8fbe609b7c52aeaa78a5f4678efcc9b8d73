staging: lustre: include: replace OBD_CHECK_DEV by obd_check_dev

Static inline functions are preferred over macros. Hence, the function
obd_check_dev was introduced. obd_check_dev replaces the macro
OBD_CHECK_DEV. All functions that call obd_check_dev store the return
values and return them if they represent an error code.

Some of the changes were carried out manually while others were done
using coccinelle.
