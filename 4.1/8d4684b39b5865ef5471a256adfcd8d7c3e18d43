pinctrl: tegra: driver layout/consistency fixes

Various non-semantic tweaks and layout/consistency fixes for existing
Tegra pinctrl drivers.

Move the definition of DRV_PINGROUP_REG() before the definition of
PINGROUP() so that a future SoC driver can invoke the former from the
latter.

PINGROUP_BIT_Y(n) is just n, so replace it with n.

Re-wrap the parameters to *PINGROUP().

Keep various enums sorted in the Tegra124 driver.

Various white-space consistency fixes.

These changes aim to update existing drivers to be consistent with future
SoC drivers. While we could ignore these tweaks to the existing drivers,
I'd like to keep everything as consistent as possible for easy comparison.
Besides, I auto-generate the drivers, and maintaining special-cases to
keep the differences in place is annoying.
