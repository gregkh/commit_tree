kasan: show gcc version requirements in Kconfig and Documentation

The documentation shows a need for gcc > 4.9.2, but it's really >=.  The
Kconfig entries don't show require versions so add them.  Correct a
latter/later typo too.  Also mention that gcc 5 required to catch out of
bounds accesses to global and stack variables.
