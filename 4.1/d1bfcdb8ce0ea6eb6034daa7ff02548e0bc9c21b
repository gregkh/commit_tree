mm: hide per-cpu lists in output of show_mem()

This makes show_mem() much less verbose on huge machines.  Instead of huge
and almost useless dump of counters for each per-zone per-cpu lists this
patch prints the sum of these counters for each zone (free_pcp) and size
of per-cpu list for current cpu (local_pcp).

The filter flag SHOW_MEM_PERCPU_LISTS reverts to the old verbose mode.
