Staging: media: lirc: Use setup_timer

This patch introduces the use of function setup_timer
instead of structure assignments as it is the preferred
way to setup and set the timer.

This is done using Coccinelle and semantic patch used is
as follows:

@@
expression x,y,z;
@@

- init_timer (&x);
+ setup_timer (&x, y, z);
- x.function = y;
- x.data = z;
