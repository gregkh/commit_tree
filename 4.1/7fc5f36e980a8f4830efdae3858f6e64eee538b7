Smack: getting the Smack security context of keys

With this commit, the LSM Smack implements the LSM
side part of the system call keyctl with the action
code KEYCTL_GET_SECURITY.

It is now possible to get the context of, for example,
the user session key using the command "keyctl security @s".

The original patch has been modified for merge.
