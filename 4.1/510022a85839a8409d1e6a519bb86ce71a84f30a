f2fs: add F2FS_INLINE_DOTS to recover missing dot dentries

If f2fs was corrupted with missing dot dentries, it needs to recover them after
fsck.f2fs detection.

The underlying precedure is:

1. The fsck.f2fs remains F2FS_INLINE_DOTS flag in directory inode, if it detects
missing dot dentries.

2. When f2fs looks up the corrupted directory, it triggers f2fs_add_link with
proper inode numbers and their dot and dotdot names.

3. Once f2fs recovers the directory without errors, it removes F2FS_INLINE_DOTS
finally.
