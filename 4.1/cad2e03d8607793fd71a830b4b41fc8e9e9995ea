ufs: add support to allow non standard behaviours (quirks)

Some implementation of UFS host controller HW might have some non-standard
behaviours (quirks) when compared to behaviour specified by UFSHCI
specification. This patch add support to allow specifying all such quirks
to standard UFS host controller driver so standard driver takes them into
account.

In this change a UFSHCD_QUIRK_DELAY_BEFORE_DME_CMDS is introduced,
where a minimum delay of 1ms is required before DME commands for
stability purposes.
