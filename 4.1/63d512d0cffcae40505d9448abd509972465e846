rhashtable: Add rehash counter to bucket_table

This patch adds a rehash counter to bucket_table to indicate
the last bucket that has been rehashed.  This serves two purposes:

1. Any bucket that has been rehashed can never gain a new object.
2. If the rehash counter reaches the size of the table, the table
will forever remain empty.

This patch also downsizes bucket_table->size to an unsigned int
since we do not support sizes greater than 32 bits yet.
