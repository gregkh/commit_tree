nilfs2: unify type of key arguments in bmap interface

The type of key arguments in block mapping interface varies depending
on function.  For instance, nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level() takes "__u64"
for its key argument whereas nilfs_bmap_lookup() takes "unsigned
long".

This fits them to "__u64" to eliminate the variation.
