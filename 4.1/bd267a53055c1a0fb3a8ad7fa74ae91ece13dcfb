MIPS: math-emu: Remove redundant code from NaN comparison

Remove a redundant call to `ieee754_setandtestcx' in `ieee754sp_cmp' and
`ieee754dp_cmp'.  The IEEE 754 exception requested will have already
been set by a call to `ieee754_setcx' immediately above, because `sig'
has to be non-zero to reach here, and the comparison result returned
will be 0 regardless of the result from the call.  Simplify the return
expression remaining.  All this reducing the size of code by 16 and 12
instructions or 64 and 48 bytes respectively.
