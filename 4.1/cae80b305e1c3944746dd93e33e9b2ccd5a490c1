locks: change lm_get_owner and lm_put_owner prototypes

The current prototypes for these operations are somewhat awkward as they
deal with fl_owners but take struct file_lock arguments. In the future,
we'll want to be able to take references without necessarily dealing
with a struct file_lock.

Change them to take fl_owner_t arguments instead and have the callers
deal with assigning the values to the file_lock structs.
