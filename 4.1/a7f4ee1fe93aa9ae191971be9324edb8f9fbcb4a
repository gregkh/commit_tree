powerpc: Drop return value of smp_ops->probe()

smp_ops->probe() is currently supposed to return the number of cpus in
the system.

The last actual usage of the value was removed in May 2007 in e147ec8f1808
"[POWERPC] Simplify smp_space_timers". We still passed the value around
until June 2010 when even that was finally removed in c1aa687d499a
"powerpc: Clean up obsolete code relating to decrementer and timebase".

So drop that requirement, probe() now returns void, and update all
implementations.
