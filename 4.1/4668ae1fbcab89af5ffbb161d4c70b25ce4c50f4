bgmac: fix DMA rx corruption

The driver needs to inform the hardware about the first invalid (not yet
filled) rx slot, by writing its DMA descriptor pointer offset to the
BGMAC_DMA_RX_INDEX register.

This register was set to a value exceeding the rx ring size, effectively
allowing the hardware constant access to the full ring, regardless of
which slots are initialized.

To fix this issue, always mark the last filled rx slot as invalid.
