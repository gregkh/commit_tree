spi: bcm2835: fill/drain SPI-fifo as much as possible during interrupt

Implement the recommendation from the BCM2835 data-sheet
with regards to polling drivers to fill/drain the FIFO as much data as possible
also for the interrupt-driven case (which this driver is making use of).

This means that for long transfers (>64bytes) we need one interrupt
every 64 bytes instead of every 12 bytes, as the FIFO is 16 words (not bytes) wide.

Tested with mcp251x (can bus), fb_st7735 (TFT framebuffer device)
and enc28j60 (ethernet) drivers.
