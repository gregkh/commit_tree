Btrfs: incremental send, remove dead code

The logic to detect path loops when attempting to apply a pending
directory rename, introduced in commit
f959492fc15b (Btrfs: send, fix more issues related to directory renames)
is no longer needed, and the respective fstests test case for that commit,
btrfs/045, now passes without this code (as well as all the other test
cases for send/receive).
