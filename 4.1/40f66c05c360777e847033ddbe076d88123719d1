Bluetooth: Add local SSP OOB data to OOB ext data mgmt command

The Read Local Out Of Band Extended Data mgmt command is specified to
return the SSP values when given a BR/EDR address type as input
parameter. The returned values may include either the 192-bit variants
of C and R, or their 256-bit variants, or both, depending on the status
of Secure Connections and Secure Connections Only modes. If SSP is not
enabled the command will only return the Class of Device value (like it
has done so far).
