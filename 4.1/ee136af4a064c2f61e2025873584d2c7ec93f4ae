uas: Add US_FL_MAX_SECTORS_240 flag

The usb-storage driver sets max_sectors = 240 in its scsi-host template,
for uas we do not want to do that for all devices, but testing has shown
that some devices need it.

This commit adds a US_FL_MAX_SECTORS_240 flag for such devices, and
implements support for it in uas.c, while at it it also adds support
for US_FL_MAX_SECTORS_64 to uas.c.
