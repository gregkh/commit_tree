checkpatch, SubmittingPatches: suggest line wrapping commit messages at 75 columns

Commit messages lines are sometimes overly long.

Suggest line wrapping at 75 columns so the default git commit log
indentation of 4 plus the commit message text still fits on an 80 column
screen.

Add a checkpatch test for long commit messages lines too.
