perf tools: Add the bash completion for listing subsubcommands of perf data

The bash completion does not support listing subsubcommands for 'perf
data <TAB>', so fix it.

Example:

Before this patch:

 $ perf data <TAB>
 $

As shown above, the subsubcommands of perf data does not come out.

After this patch:

 $ perf data <TAB>
 convert

As shown above, the subsubcommands of perf data can come out now.
