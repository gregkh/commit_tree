lib/vsprintf.c: eliminate duplicate hex string array

gcc doesn't merge or overlap const char[] objects with identical contents
(probably language lawyers would also insist that these things have
different addresses), but there's no reason to have the string
"0123456789ABCDEF" occur in multiple places.  hex_asc_upper is declared in
kernel.h and defined in lib/hexdump.c, which is unconditionally compiled
in.
