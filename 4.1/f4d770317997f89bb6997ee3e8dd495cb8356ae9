ALSA: hda - potential (but unlikely) uninitialized variable

This function is a bit unusual because it accepts negative values as
"conn_len".  It's theoretically possible for both "cache_len" and
"conn_len" to be -ENOSPC and in that case we would oops trying to run
memcmp() on the uninitialized "list" pointer.
