arm64: Get rid of struct cpu_table

struct cpu_table is an artifact left from the (very) early days of
the arm64 port, and its only real use is to allow the most beautiful
"AArch64 Processor" string to be displayed at boot time.

Really? Yes, really.

Let's get rid of it. In order to avoid another BogoMips-gate, the
aforementioned string is preserved.
