ARM: 8304/1: Respect NO_KERNEL_MAPPING when we don't have an IOMMU

Even without an iommu, NO_KERNEL_MAPPING is still convenient to save on
kernel address space in places where we don't need a kernel mapping.
Implement support for it in the two places where we're creating an
expensive mapping.

__alloc_from_pool uses an internal pool from which we already have
virtual addresses, so it's not relevant, and __alloc_simple_buffer uses
alloc_pages, which will always return a lowmem page, which is already
mapped into kernel space, so we can't prevent a mapping for it in that
case.
