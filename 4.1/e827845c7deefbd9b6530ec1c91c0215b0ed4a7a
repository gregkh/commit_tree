i40e/i40evf: Use advertised speed settings in ethtool and refactor get_settings

Add a requested speed variable to the link_status struct to store the
last speeds we requested from the firmware (the speeds the FW will be
advertising with if autoneg is enabled).

Use the advertised speed settings in get_settings in ethtool now that
we have it.  Also set the requested speed settings in set_settings in
ethtool as they are requested and initialize them in probe based on what
the firmware remembers as the last requested speeds.

To accommodate some longer lines in this new code, and improve
readability I have added two functions i40e_get_settings_link_up
and i40e_get_settings_link_down which get_settings now calls first.
It then does all of the settings that happen regardless of link
state. Some PHY types that supported the same settings were also combined.

Also update the copyright year.
