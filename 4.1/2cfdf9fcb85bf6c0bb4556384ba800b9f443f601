net: rxrpc: change call to sock_recv_ts_and_drops() on rxrpc recvmsg to sock_recv_timestamp()

Commit 3b885787ea4112 ("net: Generalize socket rx gap / receive queue overflow cmsg")
allowed receiving packet dropcount information as a socket level option.
RXRPC sockets recvmsg function was changed to support this by calling
sock_recv_ts_and_drops() instead of sock_recv_timestamp().

However, protocol families wishing to receive dropcount should call
sock_queue_rcv_skb() or set the dropcount specifically (as done
in packet_rcv()). This was not done for rxrpc and thus this feature
never worked on these sockets.

Formalizing this by not calling sock_recv_ts_and_drops() in rxrpc as
part of an effort to move skb->dropcount into skb->cb[]
