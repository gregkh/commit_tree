ARM: dts: n900: Enable omap sham and include directly omap34xx.dtsi

This patch moves content of file omap34xx-hs.dtsi into omap3-n900.dts and enable
omap sham support (omap HW support for SHA + MD5). After testing both omap hwmod
and omap-sham.ko drivers it looks like signed Nokia X-Loader enable L3 firewall
for omap sham. There is no kernel crash with both official bootloader and crypto
enable bootloader. So we can safely enable sham code.
