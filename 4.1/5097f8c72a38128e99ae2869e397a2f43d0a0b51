    drm/i915: Fix modeset state confusion in the load detect code

But this time around it was the initial fb code that forgot to update
the plane->crtc pointer. Otherwise it's the exact same bug, with the
exact same restrains (any set_config call/ioctl that doesn't disable

over there - it's rather long ...
