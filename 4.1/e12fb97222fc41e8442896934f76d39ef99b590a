ext4: make fsync to sync parent dir in no-journal for real this time

Previously commit 14ece1028b3ed53ffec1b1213ffc6acaf79ad77c added a
support for for syncing parent directory of newly created inodes to
make sure that the inode is not lost after a power failure in
no-journal mode.

However this does not work in majority of cases, namely:
 - if the directory has inline data
 - if the directory is already indexed
 - if the directory already has at least one block and:
	- the new entry fits into it
	- or we've successfully converted it to indexed

So in those cases we might lose the inode entirely even after fsync in
the no-journal mode. This also includes ext2 default mode obviously.

I've noticed this while running xfstest generic/321 and even though the
test should fail (we need to run fsck after a crash in no-journal mode)
I could not find a newly created entries even when if it was fsynced
before.

Fix this by adjusting the ext4_add_entry() successful exit paths to set
the inode EXT4_STATE_NEWENTRY so that fsync has the chance to fsync the
parent directory as well.
