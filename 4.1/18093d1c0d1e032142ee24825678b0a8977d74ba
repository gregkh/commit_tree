rhashtable: Shrink to fit

This patch changes rhashtable_shrink to shrink to the smallest
size possible rather than halving the table.  This is needed
because with multiple rehashing we will defer shrinking until
all other rehashing is done, meaning that when we do shrink
we may be able to shrink a lot.
