ACPICA: Utilities: Cleanup to remove useless ACPI_PRINTF/FORMAT_xxx helpers.

ACPICA commit b60612373a4ef63b64a57c124576d7ddb6d8efb6

For physical addresses, since the address may exceed 32-bit address range
after calculation, we should use 0x%8.8X%8.8X instead of ACPI_PRINTF_UINT
and ACPI_FORMAT_UINT64() instead of
ACPI_FORMAT_NATIVE_UINT()/ACPI_FORMAT_TO_UINT().

This patch also removes above replaced macros as there are no users.

This is a preparation to switch acpi_physical_address to 64-bit on 32-bit
kernel builds.
