xprtrdma: Perform a full marshal on retransmit

Commit 6ab59945f292 ("xprtrdma: Update rkeys after transport
reconnect" added logic in the ->send_request path to update the
chunk list when an RPC/RDMA request is retransmitted.

Note that rpc_xdr_encode() resets and re-encodes the entire RPC
send buffer for each retransmit of an RPC. The RPC send buffer
is not preserved from the previous transmission of an RPC.

Revert 6ab59945f292, and instead, just force each request to be
fully marshaled every time through ->send_request. This should
preserve the fix from 6ab59945f292, while also performing pullup
during retransmits.
