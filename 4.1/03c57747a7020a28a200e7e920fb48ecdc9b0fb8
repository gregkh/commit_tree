mpls: Per-device MPLS state

Add per-device MPLS state to supported interfaces. Use the presence of
this state in mpls_route_add to determine that this is a supported
interface.

Use the presence of mpls_dev to drop packets that arrived on an
unsupported interface - previously they were allowed through.
