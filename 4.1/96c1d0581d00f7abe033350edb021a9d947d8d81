Drivers: hv: vmbus: Add support for VMBus panic notifier handler

Hyper-V allows a guest to notify the Hyper-V host that a panic
condition occured.  This notification can include up to five 64
bit values.  These 64 bit values are written into crash MSRs.
Once the data has been written into the crash MSRs, the host is
then notified by writing into a Crash Control MSR.  On the Hyper-V
host, the panic notification data is captured in the Windows Event
log as a 18590 event.

Crash MSRs are defined in appendix H of the Hypervisor Top Level
Functional Specification.  At the time of this patch, v4.0 is the
current functional spec.  The URL for the v4.0 document is:
