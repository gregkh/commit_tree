powerpc/eeh: Do probe on pci_dn

Originally, EEH core probes on device_node or pci_dev to populate
EEH devices and PEs, which conflicts with the fact: SRIOV VFs are
usually enabled and created by PF's driver and they don't have the
corresponding device_nodes. Instead, SRIOV VFs have dynamically
created pci_dn, which can be used for EEH probe.

The patch reworks EEH probe for PowerNV and pSeries platforms to
do probing based on pci_dn, instead of pci_dev or device_node any
more.
