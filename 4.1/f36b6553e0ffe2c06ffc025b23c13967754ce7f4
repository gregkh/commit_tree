staging: lustre: include: replace OBD_CHECK_DEV_ACTIVE by obd_check_dev_active

Static inline functions are preferred over macros. The inline function
obd_check_dev_active is introduced to replace OBD_CHECK_DEV_ACTIVE.
All functions that call obd_check_dev_active store the return values
and return them if they represent an error code.

Some of the changes were carried out manually while others were done
using coccinelle.
