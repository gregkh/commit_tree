drm: Check in setcrtc if the primary plane supports the fb pixel format

Drivers implementing the universal planes API report the list of
supported pixel formats for the primary plane. Make sure the fb passed
to the setcrtc ioctl is compatible.

Drivers not implementing the universal planes API will have no format
reported for the primary plane, skip the check in that case.
