Bluetooth: Add second hci_request callback option for full skb

This patch adds a second possible callback for HCI requests where the
callback will receive the full skb of the last successfully completed
HCI command. This API is useful for cases where we want to use a request
to read some data and the existing hci_event.c handlers do not store it
e.g. in the hci_dev struct.

The reason the patch is a bit bigger than just adding the new API is
because the hci_req_cmd_complete() functions required some refactoring
to enable it: now hci_req_cmd_complete() is simply used to request the
callback pointers if any, and the actual calling of them happens from a
single place at the end of hci_event_packet(). The reason for this is
that we need to pass the original skb (without any skb_pull, etc
modifications done to it) and it's simplest to keep track of it within
the hci_event_packet() function.
