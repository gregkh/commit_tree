mm/compaction: reset compaction scanner positions

When the compaction is activated via /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory it would
better scan the whole zone.  And some platforms, for instance ARM, have
the start_pfn of a zone at zero.  Therefore the first try to compact via
/proc doesn't work.  It needs to reset the compaction scanner position
first.
