selftests/powerpc: Add a test of the switch_endian() syscall

This adds a test of the switch_endian() syscall we added in the previous
commit.

We test it by calling the endian switch syscall, and then executing some
code in the other endian to check everything went as expected. That code
checks registers we expect to be maintained are. If the endian switch
failed to happen that code sequence will be illegal and cause the test
to abort.

We then switch back to the original endian, do the same checks and
finally write a success message and exit(0).
