tcp: fix bogus RTT for CC when retransmissions are acked

Since retransmitted segments are not used for RTT estimation, previously
SACKed segments present in the rtx queue are used. This estimation can be
several times larger than the actual RTT. When a cumulative ack covers both
previously SACKed and retransmitted segments, CC may thus get a bogus RTT.

Such segments previously had an RTT estimation in tcp_sacktag_one(), so it
seems reasonable to not reuse them in tcp_clean_rtx_queue() at all.

Afaik, this has had no effect on SRTT/RTO because of Karn's check.
