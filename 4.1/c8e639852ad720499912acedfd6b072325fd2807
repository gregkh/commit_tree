target: Fix COMPARE_AND_WRITE with SG_TO_MEM_NOALLOC handling

This patch fixes a bug for COMPARE_AND_WRITE handling with
fabrics using SCF_PASSTHROUGH_SG_TO_MEM_NOALLOC.

It adds the missing allocation for cmd->t_bidi_data_sg within
transport_generic_new_cmd() that is used by COMPARE_AND_WRITE
for the initial READ payload, even if the fabric is already
providing a pre-allocated buffer for cmd->t_data_sg.

Also, fix zero-length COMPARE_AND_WRITE handling within the
compare_and_write_callback() and target_complete_ok_work()
to queue the response, skipping the initial READ.

This fixes COMPARE_AND_WRITE emulation with loopback, vhost,
and xen-backend fabric drivers using SG_TO_MEM_NOALLOC.
