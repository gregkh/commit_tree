ARM: dts: imx: Add dr_mode host setting to all host-only usb instances

The chipidea driver adds an extra line of spam to the log when a
host-only chipidea instance is left set to the default of a dual role
controller.

[    2.010873] ci_hdrc ci_hdrc.1: doesn't support gadget

Set the dr_mode property to host on all the host-only nodes
to avoid this warning.
