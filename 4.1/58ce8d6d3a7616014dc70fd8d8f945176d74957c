x86/microcode: Consolidate family,model, ... code

... to the header. Split the family acquiring function into a
main one, doing CPUID and a helper which computes the extended
family and is used in multiple places. Get rid of the locally-grown
get_x86_{family,model}().

While at it, rename local variables to something more descriptive and
vertically align assignments for better readability.

There should be no functionality change resulting from this patch.
