context_tracking: Generalize context tracking APIs to support user and guest

Generalize the context tracking APIs to support various nature of
contexts. This is performed by splitting out the mechanism from
context_tracking_user_enter and context_tracking_user_exit into
context_tracking_enter and context_tracking_exit.

The nature of the context we track is now detailed in a ctx_state
parameter pushed to these APIs, allowing the same functions to not just
track kernel <> user space switching, but also kernel <> guest transitions.

But leave the old functions in order to avoid breaking ARM, which calls
these functions from assembler code, and cannot easily use C enum
parameters.
