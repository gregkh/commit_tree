Btrfs: add missing inode item update in fallocate()

If we fallocate(), without the keep size flag, into an area already covered
by an extent previously fallocated, we were updating the inode's i_size but
we weren't updating the inode item in the fs/subvol tree. A following umount
+ mount would result in a loss of the inode's size (and an fsync would miss
too the fact that the inode changed).

Reproducer:

  $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdd
  $ mount /dev/sdd /mnt
  $ fallocate -n -l 1M /mnt/foobar
  $ fallocate -l 512K /mnt/foobar
  $ umount /mnt
  $ mount /dev/sdd /mnt
  $ od -t x1 /mnt/foobar
  0000000

The expected result is:

  $ od -t x1 /mnt/foobar
  0000000 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
  *
  2000000

A test case for fstests follows soon.
