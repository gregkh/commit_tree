MIPS: KVM: Add vcpu_get_regs/vcpu_set_regs callback

Add a vcpu_get_regs() and vcpu_set_regs() callbacks for loading and
restoring context which may be in hardware registers. This may include
floating point and MIPS SIMD Architecture (MSA) state which may be
accessed directly by the guest (but restored lazily by the hypervisor),
and also dedicated guest registers as provided by the VZ ASE.
