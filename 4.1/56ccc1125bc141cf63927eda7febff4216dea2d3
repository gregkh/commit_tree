md: fix race when unfreezing sync_action

A recent change removed the need for locking around writing
to "sync_action" (and various other places), but introduced a
subtle race.
When e.g. setting 'reshape' on a 'frozen' array, the 'frozen'
flag is cleared before 'reshape' is set, so the md thread can
get in and start trying recovery - which isn't wanted.

So instead of clearing MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN for any command
except 'frozen', only clear it when each specific command
is parsed.  This allows the handling of 'reshape' to clear
the bit while a lock is held.

Also remove some places where we set MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED,
as it is always set on non-error exit of the function.
