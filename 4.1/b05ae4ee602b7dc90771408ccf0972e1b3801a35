powerpc: Remove duplicate cacheable_memcpy/memzero functions

These functions are only used from one place each.  If the cacheable_*
versions really are more efficient, then those changes should be
migrated into the common code instead.

NOTE: The old routines are just flat buggy on kernels that support
      hardware with different cacheline sizes.
