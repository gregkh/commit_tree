spi: bcm2835: transform native-cs to gpio-cs on first spi_setup

Transforms the bcm-2835 native SPI-chip select to their gpio-cs equivalent.

This allows for some support of some optimizations that are not
possible due to HW-gliches on the CS line - especially filling
the FIFO before enabling SPI interrupts (by writing to CS register)
while the transfer is already in progress (See commit: e3a2be3030e2)

This patch also works arround some issues in bcm2835-pinctrl which does not
set the value when setting the GPIO as output - it just sets up output and
(typically) leaves the GPIO as low.  When a fix for this is merged then this
gpio_set_value can get removed from bcm2835_spi_setup.
