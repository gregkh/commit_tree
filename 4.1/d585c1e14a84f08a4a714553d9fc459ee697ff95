[media] vivid sdr: fix broken sine tone generated for sdr FM

FM (frequency modulated) signal for SDR is generated by varying the
phase, where phase variation is proportional to input signal. It is
seen that, the larger phase increments leads to discontinuities in
the signal recovered after demodulation. Reducing the extent of phase
variation with respect to input signal, equivalent to reducing the
modulation index.

Tested using FM receiver flow graph in gnuradio-companion.
