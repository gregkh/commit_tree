ASoC: dapm: add code to configure dai link parameters

dai-link params for codec-codec links were fixed. The fixed
link between codec and another chip which may be another codec,
baseband, bluetooth codec etc may require run time configuaration
changes. This change provides an optional alsa control to select
one of the params from a list of params.
