netfilter: Fix switch statement warnings with recent gcc.

More recent GCC warns about two kinds of switch statement uses:

1) Switching on an enumeration, but not having an explicit case
   statement for all members of the enumeration.  To show the
   compiler this is intentional, we simply add a default case
   with nothing more than a break statement.

2) Switching on a boolean value.  I think this warning is dumb
   but nevertheless you get it wholesale with -Wswitch.

This patch cures all such warnings in netfilter.
