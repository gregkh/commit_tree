s390/bpf: fix stack allocation

On s390x we have to provide 160 bytes stack space before we can call
the next function. From the 160 bytes that we got from the previous
function we only use 11 * 8 bytes and have 160 - 11 * 8 bytes left.
Currently for BPF we allocate additional 160 - 11 * 8 bytes for the
next function. This is wrong because then the next function only gets:

 (160 - 11 * 8) + (160 - 11 * 8) = 2 * 72 = 144 bytes

Fix this and allocate enough memory for the next function.
