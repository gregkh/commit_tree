tracing: Create cmdline tracer options on tracing fs init

The options for cmdline tracers are not created if the debugfs system
is not ready yet. If tracing has started before debugfs is up, then the
option files for the tracer are not created. Create them when creating
the tracing directory if the current tracer requires option files.
