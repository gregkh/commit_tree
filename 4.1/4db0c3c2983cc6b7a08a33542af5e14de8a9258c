mm: remove rest of ACCESS_ONCE() usages

We converted some of the usages of ACCESS_ONCE to READ_ONCE in the mm/
tree since it doesn't work reliably on non-scalar types.

This patch removes the rest of the usages of ACCESS_ONCE, and use the new
READ_ONCE API for the read accesses.  This makes things cleaner, instead
of using separate/multiple sets of APIs.
