[media] saa7146: replace current->state by set_current_state()

Use helper functions to access current->state.
Direct assignments are prone to races and therefore buggy.

current->state = TASK_RUNNING can be replaced by __set_current_state()

Thanks to Peter Zijlstra for the exact definition of the problem.
