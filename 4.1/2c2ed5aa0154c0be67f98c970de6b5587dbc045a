btrfs: clear 'ret' in btrfs_check_shared() loop

btrfs_check_shared() is leaking a return value of '1' from
find_parent_nodes(). As a result, callers (in this case, extent_fiemap())
are told extents are shared when they are not. This in turn broke fiemap on
btrfs for kernels v3.18 and up.

The fix is simple - we just have to clear 'ret' after we are done processing
the results of find_parent_nodes().

It wasn't clear to me at first what was happening with return values in
btrfs_check_shared() and find_parent_nodes() - thanks to Josef for the help
on irc. I added documentation to both functions to make things more clear
for the next hacker who might come across them.

If we could queue this up for -stable too that would be great.
