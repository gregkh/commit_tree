ocfs2: incorrect check for debugfs returns

debugfs_create_dir and debugfs_create_file may return -ENODEV when debugfs
is not configured, so the return value should be checked against
ERROR_VALUE as well, otherwise the later dereference of the dentry pointer
would crash the kernel.

This patch tries to solve this problem by fixing certain checks. However,
I have that found other call sites are protected by #ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_FS.
In current implementation, if CONFIG_DEBUG_FS is defined, then the above
two functions will never return any ERROR_VALUE. So another possibility
to fix this is to surround all the buggy checks/functions with the same
#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_FS. But I'm not sure if this would break any functionality,
as only OCFS2_FS_STATS declares dependency on DEBUG_FS.
