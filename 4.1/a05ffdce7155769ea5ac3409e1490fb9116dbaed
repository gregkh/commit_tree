ftracetest: Cope properly with stack tracer not being enabled

If the stack tracer (CONFIG_STACK_TRACER) is disabled, the
fgraph-filter-stack test blows chunks:

  [8] ftrace - function graph filters with stack tracer	[FAIL]
  + reset_tracer
  + echo nop
  ./ftracetest: 19: /home/michael/selftests/ftrace/test.d/ftrace/fgraph-filter-stack.tc:
  	cannot create /proc/sys/kernel/stack_tracer_enabled: Directory nonexistent

Fix it by checking if the proc file exists before echoing to it. With
the patch applied it fails correctly with:

  [8] ftrace - function graph filters with stack tracer	[UNSUPPORTED]
