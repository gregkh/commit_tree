perf ordered_samples: Remove references to perf_{evlist,tool} and machines

As these can be obtained from the ordered_events pointer, via
container_of, reducing the cross section of ordered_samples.

These were added to ordered_samples in:

    perf ordered_events: Shorten function signatures

    By keeping pointers to machines, evlist and tool in ordered_events.

But that was more a transitional patch while moving stuff out from
perf_session.c to ordered_events.c and possibly not even needed by then,
as we could use the container_of() method and instead of having the
nr_unordered_samples stats in events_stats, we can have it in
ordered_samples.
