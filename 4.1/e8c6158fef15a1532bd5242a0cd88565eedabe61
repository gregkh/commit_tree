mm: consolidate all page-flags helpers in <linux/page-flags.h>

Currently we take a naive approach to page flags on compound pages - we
set the flag on the page without consideration if the flag makes sense
for tail page or for compound page in general.  This patchset try to
sort this out by defining per-flag policy on what need to be done if
page-flag helper operate on compound page.

The last patch in the patchset also sanitizes usege of page->mapping for
tail pages.  We don't define the meaning of page->mapping for tail
pages.  Currently it's always NULL, which can be inconsistent with head
page and potentially lead to problems.

For now I caught one case of illegal usage of page flags or ->mapping:
sound subsystem allocates pages with __GFP_COMP and maps them with PTEs.
It leads to setting dirty bit on tail pages and access to tail_page's
->mapping.  I don't see any bad behaviour caused by this, but worth
fixing anyway.

This patchset makes more sense if you take my THP refcounting into
account: we will see more compound pages mapped with PTEs and we need to
define behaviour of flags on compound pages to avoid bugs.

This patch (of 16):

We have page-flags helper function declarations/definitions spread over
several header files.  Let's consolidate them in <linux/page-flags.h>.
