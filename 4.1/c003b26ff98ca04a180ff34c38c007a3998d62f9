mnt: In umount_tree reuse mnt_list instead of mnt_hash

umount_tree builds a list of mounts that need to be unmounted.
Utilize mnt_list for this purpose instead of mnt_hash.  This begins to
allow keeping a mount on the mnt_hash after it is unmounted, which is
necessary for a properly functioning MNT_LOCKED implementation.

The fact that mnt_list is an ordinary list makding available list_move
is nice bonus.
