rhashtable: Fix use-after-free in rhashtable_walk_stop

The commit c4db8848af6af92f90462258603be844baeab44d ("rhashtable:
Move future_tbl into struct bucket_table") introduced a use-after-
free bug in rhashtable_walk_stop because it dereferences tbl after
droping the RCU read lock.

This patch fixes it by moving the RCU read unlock down to the bottom
of rhashtable_walk_stop.  In fact this was how I had it originally
but it got dropped while rearranging patches because this one
depended on the async freeing of bucket_table.
