staging: panel: fix lcd type

the lcd type as defined in the Kconfig is not matching in the code.
as a result the rs, rw and en pins were getting interchanged.
Kconfig defines the value of PANEL_LCD to be 1 if we select custom
configuration but in the code LCD_TYPE_CUSTOM is defined as 5.

my hardware is LCD_TYPE_CUSTOM, but the pins were assigned to it
as pins of LCD_TYPE_OLD, and it was not working.
Now values are corrected with referenece to the values defined in
Kconfig and it is working.
checked on JHD204A lcd with LCD_TYPE_CUSTOM configuration.
