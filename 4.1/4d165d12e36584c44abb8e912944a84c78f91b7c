iwlwifi: mvm: assign new TLV bit for multi-source LAR

According to FW methodology, the capability bits should be the only ones
that change per-HW. The API bits should remain constant across different
HWs.
Currently this is not the case with multi-source LAR (API bit 9). Assign
a new capability bit to eventually replace the API bit. Until the API bit
can be deprecated, the driver will check either to enable multi-source
LAR.
