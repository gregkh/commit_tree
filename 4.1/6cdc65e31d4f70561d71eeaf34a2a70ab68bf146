MIPS: KVM: Emulate FPU bits in COP0 interface

Emulate FPU related parts of COP0 interface so that the guest will be
able to enable/disable the following once the FPU capability has been
wired up:
- The FPU (Status.CU1)
- 64-bit FP register mode (Status.FR)
- Hybrid FP register mode (Config5.FRE)

Changing Status.CU1 has no immediate effect if the FPU state isn't live,
as the FPU state is restored lazily on first use. After that, changes
take place immediately in the host Status.CU1, so that the guest can
start getting coprocessor unusable exceptions right away for guest FPU
operations if it is disabled. The FPU state is saved lazily too, as the
FPU may get re-enabled in the near future anyway.

Any change to Status.FR causes the FPU state to be discarded and FPU
disabled, as the register state is architecturally UNPREDICTABLE after
such a change. This should also ensure that the FPU state is fully
initialised (with stale state, but that's fine) when it is next used in
the new FP mode.

Any change to the Config5.FRE bit is immediately updated in the host
state so that the guest can get the relevant exceptions right away for
single-precision FPU operations.
