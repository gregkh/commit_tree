MIPS: math-emu: Set FIR feature flags for full emulation

Implement FIR feature flags in the FPU emulator according to features
supported and architecture level requirements.  The W, L and F64 bits
have only been added at level #2 even though the features they refer to
were also included with the MIPS64r1 ISA and the W fixed-point format
also with the MIPS32r1 ISA.

This is only relevant for the full emulation mode and the emulated CFC1
instruction as well as ptrace(2) accesses.
