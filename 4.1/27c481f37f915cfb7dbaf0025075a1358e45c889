ACPICA: Resources: Correct conditional compilation definitions.

ACPICA commit f92a08512b0b35dce4a7fc6a73216674a3c2541b

Some conditional compilation definitions are wrong across header and source
files. This patch corrects them for the resources component.

NOTE that a further patch in this patchset cleans up all ACPI_EXEC_APP,
converting them into ACPI_DEBUGGER, including part of this change.
