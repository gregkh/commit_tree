x86/asm/entry: Switch all C consumers of kernel_stack to this_cpu_sp0()

This will make modifying the semantics of kernel_stack easier.

The change to ist_begin_non_atomic() is necessary because sp0 no
longer points to the same THREAD_SIZE-aligned region as RSP;
it's one byte too high for that.  At Denys' suggestion, rather
than offsetting it, just check explicitly that we're in the
correct range ending at sp0.  This has the added benefit that we
no longer assume that the thread stack is aligned to
THREAD_SIZE.
