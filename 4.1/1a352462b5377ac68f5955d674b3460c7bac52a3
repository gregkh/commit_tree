power_supply: Add power_supply_put for decrementing device reference counter

The power_supply_get_by_phandle() and power_supply_get_by_name() use
function class_find_device() for obtaining the reference to power
supply. Each use of class_find_device() increases the power supply's
device reference counter.

However the reference counter was not decreased by users of this API.
Thus final device_unregister() call from power_supply_unregister() could
not release the device and clean up its resources. This lead to memory
leak if at least once power_supply_get_by_*() was called between
registering and unregistering the power supply.

Add and document new API power_supply_put() for decrementing the
reference counter.
