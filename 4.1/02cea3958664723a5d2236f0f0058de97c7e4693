genirq: Provide disable_hardirq()

For things like netpoll there is a need to disable an interrupt from
atomic context. Currently netpoll uses disable_irq() which will
sleep-wait on threaded handlers and thus forced_irqthreads breaks
things.

Provide disable_hardirq(), which uses synchronize_hardirq() to only wait
for active hardirq handlers; also change synchronize_hardirq() to
return the status of threaded handlers.

This will allow one to try-disable an interrupt from atomic context, or
in case of request_threaded_irq() to only wait for the hardirq part.
