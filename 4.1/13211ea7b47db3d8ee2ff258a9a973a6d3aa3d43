KVM: s390: Enable vector support for capable guest

We finally have all the pieces in place, so let's include the

for the guest to recognize.  Also, enable the vector functionality
in the guest control blocks, to avoid a possible vector data
exception that would otherwise occur when a vector instruction
is issued by the guest operating system.
