mfd: da9052: Fix broken regulator probe

Fix broken probe of da9052 regulators, which since commit b3f6c73db732
("mfd: da9052-core: Fix platform-device id collision") use a
non-deterministic platform-device id to retrieve static regulator
information. Fortunately, adequate error handling was in place so probe
would simply fail with an error message.

Update the mfd-cell ids to be zero-based and use those to identify the
cells when probing the regulator devices.
