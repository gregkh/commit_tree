powerpc/pci: Refactor pci_dn

Currently, the PCI config accessors are implemented based on device node.
Unfortunately, SRIOV VFs won't have the corresponding device nodes. pci_dn
will be used in replacement with device node for SRIOV VFs. So we have to
use pci_dn in PCI config accessors.

The patch refactors pci_dn in following aspects to make it ready to be used
in PCI config accessors as we do in subsequent patch:

   * pci_dn is organized as a hierarchy tree.  PCI device's pci_dn is
     put to the child list of pci_dn of its upstream bridge or PHB. VF's
     pci_dn will be put to the child list of pci_dn of PF's bridge.

   * For one particular PCI device (VF or not), its pci_dn can be
     found from pdev->dev.archdata.pci_data, PCI_DN(devnode), or
     parent's list.  The fast path (fetching pci_dn through PCI device
     instance) is populated during early fixup time.
