mfd: sec: Fix RTC alarm interrupt number on S2MPS11

The RTC on S2MPS11 is the same as S2MPS14. However interrupt numbers of
RTC alarms 0 and 1 were inversed between these two devices. So when
rtc-s5m driver requested S2MPS14_IRQ_RTCA0 interrupt, it matched to
S2MPS11_IRQ_RTCA1, not RTCA0.

Fix this by using consistent RTC alarm interrupt numbers and adding a
BUILD_BUG_ON for future generations.
