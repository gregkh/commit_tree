ebpf: add prandom helper for packet sampling

This work is similar to commit 4cd3675ebf74 ("filter: added BPF
random opcode") and adds a possibility for packet sampling in eBPF.

Currently, this is only possible in classic BPF and useful to
combine sampling with f.e. packet sockets, possible also with tc.

Example function proto-type looks like:

  u32 (*prandom_u32)(void) = (void *)BPF_FUNC_get_prandom_u32;
