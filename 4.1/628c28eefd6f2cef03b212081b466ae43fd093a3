xen: unify foreign GFN map/unmap for auto-xlated physmap guests

Auto-translated physmap guests (arm, arm64 and x86 PVHVM/PVH) map and
unmap foreign GFNs using the same method (updating the physmap).
Unify the two arm and x86 implementations into one commont one.

Note that on arm and arm64, the correct error code will be returned
(instead of always -EFAULT) and map/unmap failure warnings are no
longer printed.  These changes are required if the foreign domain is
paging (-ENOENT failures are expected and must be propagated up to the
caller).
