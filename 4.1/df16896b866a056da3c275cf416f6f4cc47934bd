drm/nouveau/instmem/gk20a: fix crash during error path

If a memory allocation fails when using the DMA allocator,
gk20a_instobj_dtor_dma() will be called on the failed instmem object.
At this time, node->handle might not be NULL despite the call to
dma_alloc_attrs() having failed. node->cpuaddr is the right member to
check for such a failure, so use it instead.
