net/mlx4_en: Prevent setting invalid RSS hash function

mlx4_en_check_rxfh_func() was checking for hardware support before
setting a known RSS hash function, but didn't do any check before
setting unknown RSS hash function. Need to make it fail on such values.
In this occasion, moved the actual setting of the new value from the
check function into mlx4_en_set_rxfh().
