nfsd/blocklayout: pretend we can send deviceid notifications

Commit df52699e4fcef ("NFSv4.1: Don't cache deviceids that have no
notifications") causes the Linux NFS client to stop caching deviceid's
unless a server pretends to support deviceid notifications.  While this
behavior is stupid and the language around this area in rfc5661 is a
mess carified by an errata that I submittted, Trond insists on this
behavior.  Not caching deviceids degrades block layout performance
massively as a GETDEVICEINFO is fairly expensive.

So add this hack to make the Linux client happy again.
