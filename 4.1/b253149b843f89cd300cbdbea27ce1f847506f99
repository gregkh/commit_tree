sched/idle/x86: Restore mwait_idle() to fix boot hangs, to improve power savings and to improve performance

In Linux-3.9 we removed the mwait_idle() loop:

  69fb3676df33 ("x86 idle: remove mwait_idle() and "idle=mwait" cmdline param")

The reasoning was that modern machines should be sufficiently
happy during the boot process using the default_idle() HALT
loop, until cpuidle loads and either acpi_idle or intel_idle
invoke the newer MWAIT-with-hints idle loop.

But two machines reported problems:

 1. Certain Core2-era machines support MWAIT-C1 and HALT only.
    MWAIT-C1 is preferred for optimal power and performance.
    But if they support just C1, cpuidle never loads and
    so they use the boot-time default idle loop forever.

 2. Some laptops will boot-hang if HALT is used,
    but will boot successfully if MWAIT is used.
    This appears to be a hidden assumption in BIOS SMI,
    that is presumably valid on the proprietary OS
    where the BIOS was validated.

       https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60770

So here we effectively revert the patch above, restoring
the mwait_idle() loop.  However, we don't bother restoring
the idle=mwait cmdline parameter, since it appears to add
no value.

Maintainer notes:

  For 3.9, simply revert 69fb3676df
  for 3.10, patch -F3 applies, fuzz needed due to __cpuinit use in
  context For 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, this patch applies cleanly
