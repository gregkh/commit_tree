ARM64 / ACPI: Introduce PCI stub functions for ACPI

CONFIG_ACPI depends CONFIG_PCI on x86 and ia64, in ARM64 server
world we will have PCIe in most cases, but some of them may not,
make CONFIG_ACPI depend CONFIG_PCI on ARM64 will satisfy both.

With that case, we need some arch dependent PCI functions to
access the config space before the PCI root bridge is created, and
pci_acpi_scan_root() to create the PCI root bus. So introduce
some stub function here to make ACPI core compile and revisit
them later when implemented on ARM64.
