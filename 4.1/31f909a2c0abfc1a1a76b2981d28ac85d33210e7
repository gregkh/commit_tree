nl/mac80211: allow zero plink timeout to disable STA expiration

Both wpa_supplicant and mac80211 have and inactivity timer. By default
wpa_supplicant will be timed out in 5 minutes and mac80211's it is 30
minutes. If wpa_supplicant uses a longer timer than mac80211, it will
get unexpected disconnection by mac80211.

Using 0xffffffff instead as the configured value could solve this w/o
changing the code, but due to integer overflow in the expression used
this doesn't work. The expression is:

(current jiffies) > (frame Rx jiffies + NL80211_MESHCONF_PLINK_TIMEOUT * 250)

On 32bit system, the right side would overflow and be a very small
value if NL80211_MESHCONF_PLINK_TIMEOUT is sufficiently large,
causing unexpectedly early disconnections.

Instead allow disabling the inactivity timer to avoid this situation,
by passing the (previously invalid and useless) value 0.
