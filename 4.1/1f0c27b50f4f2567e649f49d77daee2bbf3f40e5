tracing/mm: don't trace mm_page_free on offline cpus

Since tracepoints use RCU for protection, they must not be called on
offline cpus.  trace_mm_page_free can be called on an offline cpu in this
scenario caught by LOCKDEP:

     ===============================
     [ INFO: suspicious RCU usage. ]
     4.1.0-rc1+ #9 Not tainted
     -------------------------------
     include/trace/events/kmem.h:170 suspicious rcu_dereference_check() usage!

    other info that might help us debug this:

    RCU used illegally from offline CPU!
    rcu_scheduler_active = 1, debug_locks = 1
     no locks held by swapper/1/0.

    stack backtrace:
     CPU: 1 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/1 Not tainted 4.1.0-rc1+ #9
     Call Trace:

       start_secondary_prolog+0x10/0x14

Fix this by converting mm_page_free trace point into TRACE_EVENT_CONDITION
where condition is cpu_online(smp_processor_id())
