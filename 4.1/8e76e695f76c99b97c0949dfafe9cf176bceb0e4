staging: unisys: fix parenthesis alignment in visorchipset_main.c

Fix as many parenthesis alignment problems in this file as possible.

In cases where there was no good way to align to the leading parenthesis, the
content of the parenthesis were aligned as if there were no limit, and then the
leading indentation was moved back to one tab in from the previous line.
