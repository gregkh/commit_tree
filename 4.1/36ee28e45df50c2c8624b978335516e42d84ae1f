sched: Add sched_avg::utilization_avg_contrib

Add new statistics which reflect the average time a task is running on the CPU
and the sum of these running time of the tasks on a runqueue. The latter is
named utilization_load_avg.

This patch is based on the usage metric that was proposed in the 1st
versions of the per-entity load tracking patchset by Paul Turner
<pjt@google.com> but that has be removed afterwards. This version differs from
the original one in the sense that it's not linked to task_group.

The rq's utilization_load_avg will be used to check if a rq is overloaded or
not instead of trying to compute how many tasks a group of CPUs can handle.

Rename runnable_avg_period into avg_period as it is now used with both
runnable_avg_sum and running_avg_sum.

Add some descriptions of the variables to explain their differences.
