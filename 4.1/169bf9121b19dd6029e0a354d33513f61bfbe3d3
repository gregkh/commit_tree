tipc: ensure that idle links are deleted when a bearer is disabled

commit afaa3f65f65fda2e7b190aac7e2a75d9a2a77cb6
(tipc: purge links when bearer is disabled) was an attempt to resolve
a problem that turned out to have a more profound reason.

When we disable a bearer, we delete all its pertaining links if
there is no other bearer to perform failover to, or if the module
is shutting down. In case there are dual bearers, we wait with
deleting links until the failover procedure is finished.

However, this misses the case when a link on the removed bearer
was already down, so that there will be no failover procedure to
finish the link delete. This causes confusion if a new bearer is
added to replace the removed one, and also entails a small memory
leak.

This commit takes the current state of the link into account when
deciding when to delete it, and also reverses the above-mentioned
commit.
