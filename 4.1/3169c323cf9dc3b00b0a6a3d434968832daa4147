i40e: enable user dump of internal hardware state

This is a feature to enable better debugging of user reported issues by
allowing a bash script to acquire information about the internal hardware
state. The data output to the kernel log is collected by the script and can
then be sent to Intel. This is a critical debugging feature for helping us
interpret and reproduce complex customer setups.
