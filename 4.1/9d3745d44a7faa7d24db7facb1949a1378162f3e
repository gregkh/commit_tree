clk: qcom: Properly change rates for ahbix clock

The ahbix clock can never be turned off in practice. To change the
rates we need to switch the mux off the M/N counter to an always on
source (XO), reprogram the M/N counter to get the rate we want and
finally switch back to the M/N counter. Add a new ops structure
for this type of clock so that we can set the rate properly.
