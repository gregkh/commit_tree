x86/apic/uv: Update the UV APIC driver check

Fix a bug in the OEM check function that determines if the
system is a UV system and the BIOS is compatible with the
kernel's UV apic driver.  This prevents some possibly obscure
panics and guards the system against being started on SGI
hardware that does not have the required kernel support.
