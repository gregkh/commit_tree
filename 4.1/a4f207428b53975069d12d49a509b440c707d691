cpufreq: qoriq: Make the driver usable on all QorIQ platforms

Freescale introduced new ARM core-based SoCs which support dynamic
frequency switch feature. DFS on new SoCs are compatible with current
PowerPC CoreNet platforms. In order to support those new platforms,
this driver needs to be updated. The main changes include:

1. Changed the names of functions in driver.
2. Added two new functions get_cpu_physical_id() and get_bus_freq().
3. Used a new way to get the CPU mask which share clock wire.
