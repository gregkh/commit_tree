tools lib traceevent kbuffer: Remove extra update to data pointer in PADDING

When a event PADDING is hit (a deleted event that is still in the ring
buffer), translate_data() sets the length of the padding and also updates
the data pointer which is passed back to the caller.

This is unneeded because the caller also updates the data pointer with
the passed back length. translate_data() should not update the pointer,
only set the length.
