watchdog: enable the new user interface of the watchdog mechanism

With the current user interface of the watchdog mechanism it is only
possible to disable or enable both lockup detectors at the same time.
This series introduces new kernel parameters and changes the semantics of
some existing kernel parameters, so that the hard lockup detector and the
soft lockup detector can be disabled or enabled individually.  With this
series applied, the user interface is as follows.

- parameters in /proc/sys/kernel

  . soft_watchdog
    This is a new parameter to control and examine the run state of
    the soft lockup detector.

  . nmi_watchdog
    The semantics of this parameter have changed. It can now be used
    to control and examine the run state of the hard lockup detector.

  . watchdog
    This parameter is still available to control the run state of both
    lockup detectors at the same time. If this parameter is examined,
    it shows the logical OR of soft_watchdog and nmi_watchdog.

  . watchdog_thresh
    The semantics of this parameter are not affected by the patch.

- kernel command line parameters

  . nosoftlockup
    The semantics of this parameter have changed. It can now be used
    to disable the soft lockup detector at boot time.

  . nmi_watchdog=0 or nmi_watchdog=1
    Disable or enable the hard lockup detector at boot time. The patch
    introduces '=1' as a new option.

  . nowatchdog
    The semantics of this parameter are not affected by the patch. It
    is still available to disable both lockup detectors at boot time.

Also, remove the proc_dowatchdog() function which is no longer needed.
