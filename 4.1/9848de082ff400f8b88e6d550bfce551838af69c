drm/i915: Use usleep_range() in wait_for()

msleep() can sleep for way too long, so switch wait_for() to use
usleep_range() instead. Following a totally unscientific method
I just picked the range as W-2W.

This cuts the i915 init time on my BSW to almost half:
- initcall i915_init+0x0/0xa8 [i915] returned 0 after 419977 usecs
+ initcall i915_init+0x0/0xa8 [i915] returned 0 after 238419 usecs

Note that I didn't perform any other benchmarks on this so far.
