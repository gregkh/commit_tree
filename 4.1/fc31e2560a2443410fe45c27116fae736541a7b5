net/mlx4_core: Add basic support for QP max-rate limiting

Add the low-level device commands and definitions used for QP max-rate limiting.

This is done through the following elements:

  - read rate-limit device caps in QUERY_DEV_CAP: number of different
    rates and the min/max rates in Kbs/Mbs/Gbs units

  - enhance the QP context struct to contain rate limit units and value

  - allow to do run time rate-limit setting to QPs through the
    update-qp firmware command

  - QP rate-limiting is disallowed for VFs
