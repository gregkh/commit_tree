target: Fix se_tpg_tfo->tf_subsys regression + remove tf_subsystem

There is just one configfs subsystem in the target code, so we might as
well add two helpers to reference / unreference it from the core code
instead of passing pointers to it around.

This fixes a regression introduced for v4.1-rc1 with commit 9ac8928e6,
where configfs_depend_item() callers using se_tpg_tfo->tf_subsys would
fail, because the assignment from the original target_core_subsystem[]
is no longer happening at target_register_template() time.

(Fix target_core_exit_configfs pointer dereference - Sagi)
