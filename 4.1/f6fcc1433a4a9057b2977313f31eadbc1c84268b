perf report: Don't call map__kmap if map is NULL.

report__warn_kptr_restrict() calls map__kmap(kernel_map) before checking
kernel_map againest NULL.

Which is dangerous, since map__kmap() will return a invalid and not NULL
address.

It will trigger a warning message in map__kmap() after the patch "perf:
kmaps: enforce usage of kmaps to protect futher bugs." was applied.

This patch fixes it by adding the missing checking.
