drm/i915: Read CHV_PLL_DW8 from the correct offset

We accidentally pass 'pipe' instead of 'port' to CHV_PLL_DW8() and
with PIPE_C we end up at register offset 0x8320 which isn't the
0x8020 we wanted. Fix it.

The problem was fortunately caught by the sanity check in vlv_dpio_read():
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 238 at ../drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_sideband.c:200 vlv_dpio_read+0x77/0x80 [i915]()
DPIO read pipe C reg 0x8320 == 0xffffffff

The problem got introduced with this commit:
