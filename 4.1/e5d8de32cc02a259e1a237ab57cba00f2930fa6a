dm: fix false warning in free_rq_clone() for unmapped requests

When stacking request-based dm device on non blk-mq device and
device-mapper target could not map the request (error target is used,
multipath target with all paths down, etc), the WARN_ON_ONCE() in
free_rq_clone() will trigger when it shouldn't.

The warning was added by commit aa6df8d ("dm: fix free_rq_clone() NULL
pointer when requeueing unmapped request").  But free_rq_clone() with
clone->q == NULL is valid usage for the case where
dm_kill_unmapped_request() initiates request cleanup.

Fix this false warning by just removing the WARN_ON -- it only generated
false positives and was never useful in catching the intended case
(completing clone request not being mapped e.g. clone->q being NULL).

Fixes: aa6df8d ("dm: fix free_rq_clone() NULL pointer when requeueing unmapped request")
