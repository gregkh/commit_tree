perf tools: Add the bash completion for listing subsubcommands of perf script

The bash completion does not support listing subsubcommands for 'perf
script <TAB>', so fix it.

Example:

Before this patch:

 $ perf script <TAB>
 $

As shown above, the subsubcommands of perf script does not come out.

After this patch:

 $ perf script <TAB>
 record  report

As shown above, the subsubcommands of perf script can come out now.
