NVMe: fix type warning on 32-bit

A recent change to the ioctl handling caused a new harmless
warning in the NVMe driver on all 32-bit machines:

drivers/block/nvme-core.c: In function 'nvme_submit_io':
drivers/block/nvme-core.c:1794:29: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]

In order to shup up that warning, this introduces a new
temporary variable that uses a double cast to extract
the pointer from an __u64 structure member.
