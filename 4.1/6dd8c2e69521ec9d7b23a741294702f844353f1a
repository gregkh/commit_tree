usb: gadget: printer: allocate printer_dev instances dynamically

With all the obstacles removed it is possible to allow more than one
instance of the printer function. Since the function requires allocating
character device region, a maximum number of allowed instances is defined.
Such an approach is used in f_acm and in f_hid.
With multiple instances it does not make sense to depend on a
lock_printer_io member of a dynamically allocated (and destroyed) struct
printer_dev to clean up after all instances of the printer function.
