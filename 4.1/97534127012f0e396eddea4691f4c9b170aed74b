mm/hugetlb: use pmd_page() in follow_huge_pmd()

Commit 61f77eda9bbf ("mm/hugetlb: reduce arch dependent code around
follow_huge_*") broke follow_huge_pmd() on s390, where pmd and pte
layout differ and using pte_page() on a huge pmd will return wrong
results.  Using pmd_page() instead fixes this.

All architectures that were touched by that commit have pmd_page()
defined, so this should not break anything on other architectures.
