x86: kvm: Revert "remove sched notifier for cross-cpu migrations"

The following point:

    2. per-CPU pvclock time info is updated if the
       underlying CPU changes.

Is not true anymore since "KVM: x86: update pvclock area conditionally,
on cpu migration".

Add task migration notification back.

Problem noticed by Andy Lutomirski.
