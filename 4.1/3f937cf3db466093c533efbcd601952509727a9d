Revert "ARM: rockchip: fix undefined instruction of reset_ctrl_regs"

This reverts commit b403125d3bbf8046c1186e1a49cb17bb5551db14.

As reported by Chris, both commits
        b403125 "ARM: rockchip: fix undefined instruction of reset_ctrl_regs"
        0ea001d "ARM: rockchip: disable dapswjdp during suspend"
actually fix the same issue and b403125 is the older one, which got
superseded by 0ea001d. Therefore revert the obsolete one again.
