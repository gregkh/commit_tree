dmaengine: jz4780: add driver for the Ingenic JZ4780 DMA controller

This patch adds a driver for the DMA controller found in the Ingenic
JZ4780.

It currently does not implement any support for the programmable firmware
feature of the controller - this is not necessary for most uses. It also
does not take priority into account when allocating channels, it just
allocates the first available channel. This can be implemented later.
