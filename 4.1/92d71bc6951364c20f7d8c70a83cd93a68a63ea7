KVM: nVMX: remove unnecessary double caching of MAXPHYADDR

After speed-up of cpuid_maxphyaddr() it can be called frequently:
instead of heavyweight enumeration of CPUID entries it returns a cached
pre-computed value. It is also inlined now. So caching its result became
unnecessary and can be removed.
