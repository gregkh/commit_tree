[media] omap3isp: Refactor device configuration structs for Device Tree

Make omap3isp configuration data structures more suitable for consumption by
the DT by separating the I2C bus information of all the sub-devices in a
group and the ISP bus information from each other. The ISP bus information
is made a pointer instead of being directly embedded in the struct.

In the case of the DT only the sensor specific information on the ISP bus
configuration is retained. The structs are renamed to reflect that.

After this change the structs needed to describe device configuration can be
allocated and accessed separately without those needed only in the case of
platform data. The platform data related structs can be later removed once
the support for platform data can be removed.
