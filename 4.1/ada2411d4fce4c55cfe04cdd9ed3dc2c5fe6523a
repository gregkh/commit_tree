fm10k: comment next_vf_mbx flow

Add a header comment explaining why we have the somewhat crazy mailbox
flow. This flow is necessary as it prevents the PF<->SM mailbox from
being flooded by the VF messages, which normally trigger a message to
the PF. This helps prevent the case where we see a PF mailbox timeout.
