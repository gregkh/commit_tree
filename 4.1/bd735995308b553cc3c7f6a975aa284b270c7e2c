misc: Add attribute groups

Add groups field to struct miscdevice for passing the attribute groups
at device creation.  In this way, the driver can avoid the manual call
of device_create_file() after the device registration, which is
basically a racy operation, in addition to the reduction of manual
device_remove_file() calls.
