KVM: s390: deliver floating interrupts in order of priority

This patch makes interrupt handling compliant to the z/Architecture
Principles of Operation with regard to interrupt priorities.

Add a bitmap for pending floating interrupts. Each bit relates to a
interrupt type and its list. A turned on bit indicates that a list
contains items (interrupts) which need to be delivered.  When delivering
interrupts on a cpu we can merge the existing bitmap for cpu-local
interrupts and floating interrupts and have a single mechanism for
delivery.
Currently we have one list for all kinds of floating interrupts and a
corresponding spin lock. This patch adds a separate list per
interrupt type. An exception to this are service signal and machine check
interrupts, as there can be only one pending interrupt at a time.
