mpls: Cleanup the rcu usage in the code.

Sparse was generating a lot of warnings mostly from missing annotations
in the code.  Add missing annotations and in a few cases tweak the code
for performance by moving work before loops.

This also fixes a problematic ommision of rcu_assign_pointer and
rcu_dereference.

Hopefully with complete rcu annotations any new rcu errors will stick
out like a sore thumb.
