spi: dw: program registers as soon as possible

This patch refactors the code in pump_transfers() to reprogram the registers
immediately when we have a new configuration data. The behaviour is slightly
modified:
 - chip is always disabled and reenabled
 - CTRL0 is always reprogrammed

This change allows to do a further refactoring and simplier conversion to use
SPI core DMA routines in the future.
