perf symbols: Allow symbol alias when loading map for symbol name

When perf probe tries to add a probe in a binary using symbol name, it
sometimes failed since some symbols were discard during loading dso.

When it resolves an address to symbol, it'd be better to have just one
symbol at given address.  But for finding address from symbol, it'd be
better to keep all names (including aliases).

So allow tools to state that they want to allow aliases via
symbol_conf.allow_aliases.
