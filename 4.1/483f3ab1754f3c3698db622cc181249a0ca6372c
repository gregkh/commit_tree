iwlwifi: pcie: initialize trans_pcie->ref_count on configure()

ref_count is currently initialized on start_fw(). This causes
some issues in restart flow, as currently active references
(e.g. unclaimed command) will get cleared, resulting in
invalid reference accounting.

Move the ref_count initialization to the configure() trans op,
so it won't be re-initialized on restart.
