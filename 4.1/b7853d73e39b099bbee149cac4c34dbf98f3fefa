bridge: add vlan info to bridge setlink and dellink notification messages

vlan add/deletes are not notified to userspace today. This patch adds
vlan info to bridge newlink/dellink notifications generated from the
bridge driver. Notifications use the RTEXT_FILTER_BRVLAN_COMPRESSED
flag to compress vlans into ranges whereever applicable.

The size calculations does not take ranges into account for
simplicity.  This has the potential for allocating a larger skb than
required.

There is an existing inconsistency with bridge NEWLINK and DELLINK
change notifications. Both generate NEWLINK notifications.  Since its
always a NEWLINK notification, this patch includes all vlans the port
belongs to in the notification. The NEWLINK and DELLINK request
messages however only include the vlans to be added and deleted.
