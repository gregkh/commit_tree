Bluetooth: Disallow LE local out-of-band data when LE privacy is used

When the LE pivacy feature is used, then pairing has to happen based
on resolvable random addresses (RPA), but currently there is no clean
way to retrieve the correct RPA. So instead of returning an outdated
RPA, just disallow this command when LE privacy is in use.
