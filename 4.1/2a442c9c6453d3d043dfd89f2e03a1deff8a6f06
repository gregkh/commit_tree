x86: Use common outgoing-CPU-notification code

This commit removes the open-coded CPU-offline notification with new
common code.  Among other things, this change avoids calling scheduler
code using RCU from an offline CPU that RCU is ignoring.  It also allows
Xen to notice at online time that the CPU did not go offline correctly.
Note that Xen has the surviving CPU carry out some cleanup operations,
so if the surviving CPU times out, these cleanup operations might have
been carried out while the outgoing CPU was still running.  It might
therefore be unwise to bring this CPU back online, and this commit
avoids doing so.
