fib_trie: Avoid NULL pointer if local table is not allocated

The function fib_unmerge assumed the local table had already been
allocated.  If that is not the case however when custom rules are applied
then this can result in a NULL pointer dereference.

In order to prevent this we must check the value of the local table pointer
and if it is NULL simply return 0 as there is no local table to separate
from the main.
