PCI: Update DMA configuration from DT

If there is a DT node available for the root bridge's parent device, use
the DMA configuration from that device node.  For example, Keystone PCI
devices would require dma_pfn_offset to be set correctly in the device
structure of the PCI device in order to have the correct DMA mask.  The DT
node will have dma-ranges defined for this.  Also support using the DT
property dma-coherent to allow coherent DMA operation by the PCI device.

Use the new helper function of_pci_dma_configure() to update the device DMA
configuration.  This fixes DMA on systems where DMA addresses are a
constant offset from CPU physical addresses.
