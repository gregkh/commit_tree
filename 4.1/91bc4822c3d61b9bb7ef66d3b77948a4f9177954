tc: bpf: add checksum helpers

Commit 608cd71a9c7c ("tc: bpf: generalize pedit action") has added the
possibility to mangle packet data to BPF programs in the tc pipeline.
This patch adds two helpers bpf_l3_csum_replace() and bpf_l4_csum_replace()
for fixing up the protocol checksums after the packet mangling.

It also adds 'flags' argument to bpf_skb_store_bytes() helper to avoid
unnecessary checksum recomputations when BPF programs adjusting l3/l4
checksums and documents all three helpers in uapi header.

Moreover, a sample program is added to show how BPF programs can make use
of the mangle and csum helpers.
