[media] vivid sdr: Use LUT based implementation for sin/cos()

The common implementation for sin/cos in include/linux/fixp-arith.h
has been improved recently to provide higher precision.

Replacing native implementation of sin/cos in vivid sdr with common
implementation. This serves two purposes:

1. Improved accuracy: the native implementation based on the Taylor
   series is more prone to rounding errors.
2. Reuse of common function: this is better compared to maintaining
   native versions for each driver.
