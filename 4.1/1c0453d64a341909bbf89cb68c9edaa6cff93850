IB/ipoib: drop mcast_mutex usage

We needed the mcast_mutex when we had to prevent the join completion
callback from having the value it stored in mcast->mc overwritten
by a delayed return from ib_sa_join_multicast.  By storing the return
of ib_sa_join_multicast in an intermediate variable, we prevent a
delayed return from ib_sa_join_multicast overwriting the valid
contents of mcast->mc, and we no longer need a mutex to force the
join callback to run after the return of ib_sa_join_multicast.  This
allows us to do away with the mutex entirely and protect our critical
sections with a just a spinlock instead.  This is highly desirable
as there were some places where we couldn't use a mutex because the
code was not allowed to sleep, and so we were currently using a mix
of mutex and spinlock to protect what we needed to protect.  Now we
only have a spin lock and the locking complexity is greatly reduced.
