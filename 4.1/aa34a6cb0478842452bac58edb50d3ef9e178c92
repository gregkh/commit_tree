rhashtable: Add arbitrary rehash function

This patch adds a rehash function that supports the use of any
hash function for the new table.  This is needed to support changing
the random seed value during the lifetime of the hash table.

However for now the random seed value is still constant and the
rehash function is simply used to replace the existing expand/shrink
functions.

[ ASSERT_BUCKET_LOCK() and thus debug_dump_table() +
  debug_dump_buckets() are not longer used, so delete them
  entirely. -DaveM ]
