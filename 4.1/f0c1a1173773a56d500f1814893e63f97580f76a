sparc64: pci slots information is not populated in sysfs

Add PCI slot numbers within sysfs for PCIe hardware.  Larger
PCIe systems with nested PCI bridges and slots further
down on these bridges were not being populated within sysfs.
This will add ACPI style PCI slot numbers for these systems
since the OF 'slot-names' information is not available on
all PCIe platforms.
