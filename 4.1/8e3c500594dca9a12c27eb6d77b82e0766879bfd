fs/9p: fix readdir()

Al Viro's IOV changes broke 9p readdir() because the new code
didn't abort the read when it returned nothing. The original
code checked if the combined error/length was <= 0 but in the
new code that accidentally got changed to just an error check.

Add back the return from the function when nothing is read.
