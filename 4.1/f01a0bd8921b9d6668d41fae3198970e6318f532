serial: 8250: Check UART_SCR is writable

Au1x00/RT2800+ doesn't implement the 8250 scratch register (and
this may be true of other h/w currently supported by the 8250 driver);
read back the canary value written to the scratch register to enable
the console h/w restart after resume from system suspend.
