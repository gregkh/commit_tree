tcp: do not cache align timewait sockets

With recent adoption of skc_cookie in struct sock_common,
struct tcp_timewait_sock size increased from 192 to 200 bytes
on 64bit arches. SLAB rounds then to 256 bytes.

It is time to drop SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN constraint for twsk_slab.

This saves about 12 MB of memory on typical configuration reaching
262144 timewait sockets, and has no noticeable impact on performance.
