fm10k: Modify tunnel length header check when offloading

The FM10000 host interface can only support up to 184 bytes when
performing tunnel offloads. Because of this, a check was added to
prevent the driver from attempting to feed a header to the hardware too
big for it to parse. Make this check a little more robust by calculating
the inner L4 header length based on whether it is TCP or UDP.
