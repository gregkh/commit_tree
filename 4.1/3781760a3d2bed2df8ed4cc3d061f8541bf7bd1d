[media] soc-camera: Make clock_start and clock_stop operations optional

Instead of forcing drivers to implement empty clock operations, make
them optional.

v4l2 clock registration in the soc-camera core should probably be
conditionned on the availability of those operations, but careful
review and/or testing of all drivers would be needed, so that should be
a separate step.
