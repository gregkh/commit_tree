PCI: Keep individual VF BAR size in struct pci_sriov

Currently we don't store the individual VF BAR size.  We calculate it when
needed by dividing the PF's IOV resource size (which contains space for
*all* the VFs) by total_VFs or by reading the BAR in the SR-IOV capability
again.

Keep the individual VF BAR size in struct pci_sriov.barsz[], add
pci_iov_resource_size() to retrieve it, and use that instead of doing the
division or reading the SR-IOV capability BAR.

[bhelgaas: rename to "barsz[]", simplify barsz[] index computation, remove
SR-IOV capability BAR sizing]
