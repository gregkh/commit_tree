aio: fix serial draining in exit_aio()

exit_aio() currently serializes killing io contexts. Each context
killing ends up having to do percpu_ref_kill(), which in turns has
to wait for an RCU grace period. This can take a long time, depending
on the number of contexts. And there's no point in doing them serially,
when we could be waiting for all of them in one fell swoop.

This patches makes my fio thread offload test case exit 0.2s instead
of almost 6s.
