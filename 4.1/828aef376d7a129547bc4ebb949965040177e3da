ACPI / processor: Introduce phys_cpuid_t for CPU hardware ID

CPU hardware ID (phys_id) is defined as u32 in structure acpi_processor,
but phys_id is used as int in acpi processor driver, so it will lead to
some inconsistence for the drivers.

Furthermore, to cater for ACPI arch ports that implement 64 bits CPU
ids a generic CPU physical id type is required.

So introduce typedef u32 phys_cpuid_t in a common file, and introduce
a macro PHYS_CPUID_INVALID as (phys_cpuid_t)(-1) if it's not defined
by other archs, this will solve the inconsistence in acpi processor driver,
and will prepare for the ACPI on ARM64 for the 64 bit CPU hardware ID
in the following patch.
