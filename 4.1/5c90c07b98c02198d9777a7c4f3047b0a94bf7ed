serial: xilinx: Use platform_get_irq to get irq description structure

For systems with CONFIG_SERIAL_OF_PLATFORM=y and device_type =
"serial"; property in DT of_serial.c driver maps and unmaps IRQ (because
driver probe fails). Then a driver is called but irq mapping is not
created that's why driver is failing again in again on request_irq().
Based on this use platform_get_irq() instead of platform_get_resource()
which is doing irq_desc allocation and driver itself can request IRQ.

Fix both xilinx serial drivers in the tree.
