blk-mq: fix CPU hotplug handling

hctx->tags has to be set as NULL in case that it is to be unmapped
no matter if set->tags[hctx->queue_num] is NULL or not in blk_mq_map_swqueue()
because shared tags can be freed already from another request queue.

The same situation has to be considered during handling CPU online too.
Unmapped hw queue can be remapped after CPU topo is changed, so we need
to allocate tags for the hw queue in blk_mq_map_swqueue(). Then tags
allocation for hw queue can be removed in hctx cpu online notifier, and it
is reasonable to do that after mapping is updated.
