arm64: enforce x1|x2|x3 == 0 upon kernel entry as per boot protocol

According to the arm64 boot protocol, registers x1 to x3 should be
zero upon kernel entry, and non-zero values are reserved for future
use. This future use is going to be problematic if we never enforce
the current rules, so start enforcing them now, by emitting a warning
if non-zero values are detected.
