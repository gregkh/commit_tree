ARM: 8314/1: replace PROCINFO embedded branch with relative offset

This patch replaces the 'branch to setup()' instructions embedded
in the PROCINFO structs with the offset to that setup function
relative to the base of the struct. This preserves the position
independent nature of that field, but uses a data item rather
than an instruction.

This is mainly done to prevent linker failures on large kernels,
where the setup function is out of reach for the branch.
