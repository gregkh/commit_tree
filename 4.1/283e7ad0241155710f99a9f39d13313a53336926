init: stricter checking of major:minor root= values

In the kernel command-line, previously, root=1:2jakshflaksjdhfa would
be accepted and interpreted just like root=1:2. This patch adds
stricter checking so that additional characters after major:minor are
rejected by root=.

The goal of this change is to help in unifying DM's interpretation of
its block device argument by using existing kernel code (name_to_dev_t).
But DM rejects malformed major:minor pairs, it seems reasonable for
root= to reject them as well.
