vfio: Split virqfd into a separate module for vfio bus drivers

An unintended consequence of commit 42ac9bd18d4f ("vfio: initialize
the virqfd workqueue in VFIO generic code") is that the vfio module
is renamed to vfio_core so that it can include both vfio and virqfd.
That's a user visible change that may break module loading scritps
and it imposes eventfd support as a dependency on the core vfio code,
which it's really not.  virqfd is intended to be provided as a service
to vfio bus drivers, so instead of wrapping it into vfio.ko, we can
make it a stand-alone module toggled by vfio bus drivers.  This has
the additional benefit of removing initialization and exit from the
core vfio code.
