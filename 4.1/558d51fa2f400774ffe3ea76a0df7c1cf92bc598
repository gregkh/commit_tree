switchdev: fix stp update API to work with layered netdevices

make it same as the netdev_switch_port_bridge_setlink/dellink
api (ie traverse lowerdevs to get to the switch port).

removes "WARN_ON(!ops->ndo_switch_parent_id_get)" because
direct bridge ports can be stacked netdevices (like bonds
and team of switch ports) which may not implement this ndo.

v2 to v3:
	- remove changes to bond and team. Bring back the
	transparently following lowerdevs like i initially
	had for setlink/getlink
	(http://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg313436.html)
	dave and scott feldman also seem to prefer it be that
	way and move to non-transparent way of doing things
	if we see a problem down the lane.

v3 to v4:
	- fix ret initialization

v4 to v5:
	- return err on first failure (scott feldman)

v5 to v6:
	- change variable name (err) and initialize to
	-EOPNOTSUPP (scott feldman).
