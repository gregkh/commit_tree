Input: alps - do not reduce trackpoint speed by half

On some v7 devices (e.g. Lenovo-E550) the deltas reported are typically
only in the 0-1 range dividing this by 2 results in a range of 0-0.

And even for v7 devices where this does not lead to making the trackstick
entirely unusable, it makes it twice as slow as before we added v7 support
and were using the ps/2 mouse emulation of the dual point setup.

If some kind of generic slowdown is actually necessary for some devices,
then that belongs in userspace, not in the kernel.
