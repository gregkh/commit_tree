perf probe: Fix failure to add multiple probes without debuginfo

Perf tries to find probe function addresses from map when debuginfo
could not be found.

To the first added function, the value of ref_reloc_sym was set in
maps__set_kallsyms_ref_reloc_sym() and can be obtained from
host_machine->kmaps->maps. After that, new maps are added to
host_machine->kmaps->maps in dso__load_kcore(), all these new added maps
do not have a valid ref_reloc_sym.

When adding a second function, get_target_map() may get a map without
valid ref_reloc_sym, and raise the error "Relocated base symbol is not
found".

Fix this by using kernel_get_ref_reloc_sym() to get ref_reloc_sym.

This problem can be reproduced as following:

  $ perf probe --add='sys_write' --add='sys_open'
  Relocated base symbol is not found!
    Error: Failed to add events.

After this patch:

  $ perf probe --add='sys_write' --add='sys_open'
  Added new event:
    probe:sys_write      (on sys_write)

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

      perf record -e probe:sys_write -aR sleep 1

  Added new event:
    probe:sys_open       (on sys_open)

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

      perf record -e probe:sys_open -aR sleep 1
