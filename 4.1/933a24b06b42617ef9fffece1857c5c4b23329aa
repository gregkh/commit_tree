irqchip: armada-370-xp: Initialize per cpu registers when CONFIG_SMP=N

The irqchip driver called armada_xp_mpic_smp_cpu_init() when CONFIG_SMP=Y
to initialize some per cpu registers. The function is called on each
CPU by calling it explicitly on the boot CPU and then using a CPU notifier
for the non boot CPUs.

This commit removes the CONFIG_SMP constrain, so the per cpu registers are
also initialized when CONFIG_SMP=N, which is the right thing to do.
