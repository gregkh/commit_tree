sched/deadline: Fix rt runtime corruption when dl fails its global constraints

One version of sched_rt_global_constaints() (the !rt-cgroup one)
changes state, therefore if we fail the later sched_dl_global_constraints()
call the state is left in an inconsistent state.

Fix this by changing the order of the calls.
