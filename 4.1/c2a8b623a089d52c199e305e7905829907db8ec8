iio: adis16400: Compute the scan mask from channel indices

We unfortunately can't use ~0UL for the scan mask to indicate that the
only valid scan mask is all channels selected. The IIO core needs the exact
mask to work correctly and not a super-set of it. So calculate the masked
based on the channels that are available for a particular device.
