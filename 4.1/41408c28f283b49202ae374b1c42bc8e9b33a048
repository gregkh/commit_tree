KVM: s390: Add MEMOP ioctls for reading/writing guest memory

On s390, we've got to make sure to hold the IPTE lock while accessing
logical memory. So let's add an ioctl for reading and writing logical
memory to provide this feature for userspace, too.
The maximum transfer size of this call is limited to 64kB to prevent
that the guest can trigger huge copy_from/to_user transfers. QEMU
currently only requests up to one or two pages so far, so 16*4kB seems
to be a reasonable limit here.
