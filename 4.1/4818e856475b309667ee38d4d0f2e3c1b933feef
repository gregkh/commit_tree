bna: fix soft lock-up during firmware initialization failure

Bug in the driver initialization causes soft-lockup if firmware
initialization timeout is reached. Polling function bfa_ioc_poll_fwinit()
incorrectly calls bfa_nw_iocpf_timeout() when the timeout is reached.
The problem is that bfa_nw_iocpf_timeout() calls again
bfa_ioc_poll_fwinit()... etc. The bfa_ioc_poll_fwinit() should directly
send timeout event for iocpf and the same should be done if firmware
download into HW fails.
