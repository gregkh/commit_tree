IB/iser: Merge build page-vec into register page-vec

No need for these two separate. Keep it in a single routine
like in the fastreg case. This will also make iser_reg_page_vec
closer to iser_fast_reg_mr arguments. This is a preparation
step for registration flow refactor.

This patch does not change any functionality.
