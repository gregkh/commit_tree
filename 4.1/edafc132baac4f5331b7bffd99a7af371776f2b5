xen-netback: making the bandwidth limiter runtime settable

With the current netback, the bandwidth limiter's parameters are only
settable during vif setup time.  This patch register a watch on them, and
thus makes them runtime changeable.

When the watch fires, the timer is reset.  The timer's mutex is used for
fencing the change.
