drm/i915: Add eDP intermediate frequencies for CHV

"P1273_DPLL_Programming Spreadsheet.xlsm" lists a boatload of
frequencies for eDP. Try to use them all.

For now I've decided not to add hardcoded DPLL dividers for these cases
since chv_find_best_dpll() works just fine.

I've not actually tested any of these since I don't have an eDP 1.4 panel.
