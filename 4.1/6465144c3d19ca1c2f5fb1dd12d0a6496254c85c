Staging: rtl8192u: Convert use of __constant_<foo> to <foo>

Using functions of the form __constant_<foo> isn't preferred
outside of include/uapi/ as using the function without
__constant_ is identical when the argument is a constant.
So, this patch replaces __constant_htons with htons.

This is done using Coccinelle and semantic patch used for
this is as follows:

@@identifier x;@@

(
- __constant_htons(x)
+ htons(x)
|
- __constant_htonl(x)
+ htonl(x)
|
- __constant_ntohs(x)
+ htons(x)
|
- __constant_ntohl(x)
+ htonl(x)
)
