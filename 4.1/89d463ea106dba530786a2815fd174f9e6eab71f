drivers: bus: Add Simple Power-Managed Bus Driver

Add a driver for transparent busses that don't need a real driver, but
where the bus controller is part of a PM domain, or under the control of
a functional clock.  Typically, the bus controller's PM domain and/or
clock must be enabled for child devices connected to the bus (either
on-SoC or externally) to function.

Hence the sole purpose of this driver is to enable its clock and PM
domain (if exist(s)), which are specified in the DT and managed from
platform and PM domain code, and to probe for child devices.

Due to the child-parent relationship with devices connected to the bus,
PM domain and clock state transitions are handled in the correct order.
