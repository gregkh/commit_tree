x86/asm/entry/64: Fix comment about SYSENTER MSRs

The comment is ancient, it dates to the time when only AMD's
x86_64 implementation existed. AMD wasn't (and still isn't)
supporting SYSENTER, so these writes were "just in case" back
then.

This has changed: Intel's x86_64 appeared, and Intel does
support SYSENTER in long mode. "Some future 64-bit CPU" is here
already.

The code may appear "buggy" for AMD as it stands, since
MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_EIP is only 32-bit for AMD CPUs. Writing a
kernel function's address to it would drop high bits. Subsequent
use of this MSR for branch via SYSENTER seem to allow user to
transition to CPL0 while executing his code. Scary, eh?

Explain why that is not a bug: because SYSENTER insn would not
work on AMD CPU.
