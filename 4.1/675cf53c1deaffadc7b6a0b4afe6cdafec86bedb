lib/vsprintf.c: improve put_dec_trunc8 slightly

I hadn't had enough coffee when I wrote this. Currently, the final
increment of buf depends on the value loaded from the table, and
causes gcc to emit a cmov immediately before the return. It is smarter
to let it depend on r, since the increment can then be computed in
parallel with the final load/store pair. It also shaves 16 bytes of
.text.
