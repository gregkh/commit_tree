x86/asm/entry/64: Use better label name, fix comments

A named label "ret_from_sys_call" implies that there are jumps
to this location from elsewhere, as happens with many other
labels in this file.

But this label is used only by the JMP a few insns above.
To make that obvious, use local numeric label instead.

Improve comments:

"and return regs->ax" isn't too informative. We always return
regs->ax.

The comment suggesting that it'd be cool to use rip relative
addressing for CALL is deleted. It's unclear why that would be
an improvement - we aren't striving to use position-independent
code here. PIC code here would require something like LEA
sys_call_table(%rip),reg + CALL *(reg,%rax*8)...

"iret frame is also incomplete" is no longer true, fix that too.

Also fix typo in comment.
