usb: host: xhci: add mutex for non-thread-safe data

Regression in commit 638139eb95d2 ("usb: hub: allow to process more usb
hub events in parallel")

The regression resulted in intermittent failure to initialise a 10-port
hub (with three internal VL812 4-port hub controllers) on boot, with a
failure rate of around 8%, due to multiple race conditions when
accessing addr_dev and slot_id in struct xhci_hcd.

This regression also exposed a problem with xhci_setup_device, which
"should be protected by the usb_address0_mutex" but no longer is due to

commit 6fecd4f2a58c ("USB: separate usb_address0 mutexes for each bus")

With separate buses (and locks) it is no longer the case that a single
lock will protect xhci_setup_device from accesses by two parallel
threads processing events on the two buses.

Fix this by adding a mutex to protect addr_dev and slot_id in struct
xhci_hcd, and by making the assignment of slot_id atomic.

Fixes multiple boot errors:

[ 0.583008] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: Bad Slot ID 2
[ 0.583009] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: Could not allocate xHCI USB device data structures
[ 0.583012] usb usb1-port3: couldn't allocate usb_device

And:

[ 0.637417] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: Max number of devices this xHCI host supports is 32.

And:

[ 0.753403] usb usb1-port3: couldn't allocate usb_device

And:

And:

[ 5.753838] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: Timeout while waiting for setup device command

Tested with 200 reboots, resulting in no USB hub init related errors.
