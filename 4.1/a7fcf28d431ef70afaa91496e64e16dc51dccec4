x86/asm/entry: Replace this_cpu_sp0() with current_top_of_stack() and fix it on x86_32

I broke 32-bit kernels.  The implementation of sp0 was correct
as far as I can tell, but sp0 was much weirder on x86_32 than I
realized.  It has the following issues:

 - Init's sp0 is inconsistent with everything else's: non-init tasks
   are offset by 8 bytes.  (I have no idea why, and the comment is unhelpful.)

 - vm86 does crazy things to sp0.

Fix it up by replacing this_cpu_sp0() with
current_top_of_stack() and using a new percpu variable to track
the top of the stack on x86_32.
