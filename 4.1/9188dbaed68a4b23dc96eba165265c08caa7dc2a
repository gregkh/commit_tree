HID: logitech-hidpp: add a module parameter to keep firmware gestures

The Logitech T650 used to report 3 fingers swipes to the up as a press on the
Super key. When we switched the touchpad to the raw mode, we also disable such
firmware gesture and some users may rely on it.

Unfortunately, 3 finger swipes are still not supported in most of the Linux
environments, which means that we disabled a feature of the touchpad.

Allow users to revert the raw reporting mode and keep going with the firmware
gestures by providing a new module parameter.
