MIPS: assume at as source/dest of MSA copy/insert instructions

Assuming at ($1) as the source or destination register of copy or
insert instructions:

  - Simplifies the macros providing those instructions for toolchains
    without MSA support.

  - Avoids an unnecessary move instruction when at is used as the source
    or destination register anyway.

  - Is sufficient for the uses to be introduced in the kernel by a
    subsequent patch.

Note that due to a patch ordering snafu on my part this also fixes the
currently broken build with MSA support enabled. The build has been
broken since commit c9017757c532 "MIPS: init upper 64b of vector
registers when MSA is first used", which this patch should have
preceeded.
