zram: describe device attrs in documentation

Briefly describe exported device stat attrs in zram documentation.  We
will eventually get rid of per-stat sysfs nodes and, thus, clean up
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-block-zram file, which is the only source
of information about device sysfs nodes.

Add `num_migrated' description, since there is no independent
`num_migrated' sysfs node (and no corresponding sysfs-block-zram entry),
it will be exported via zram<id>/mm_stat file.

At this point we can provide minimal description, because sysfs-block-zram
still contains detailed information.
