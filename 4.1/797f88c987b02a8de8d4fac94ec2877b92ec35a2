Drivers: hv: hv_balloon: correctly handle num_pages>INT_MAX case

balloon_wrk.num_pages is __u32 and it comes from host in struct dm_balloon
where it is also __u32. We, however, use 'int' in balloon_up() and in case
we happen to receive num_pages>INT_MAX request we'll end up allocating zero
pages as 'num_pages < alloc_unit' check in alloc_balloon_pages() will pass.
Change num_pages type to unsigned int.

In real life ballooning request come with num_pages in [512, 32768] range so
this is more a future-proof/cleanup.
