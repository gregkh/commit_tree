brcmfmac: only support the BCM43455/7 device

Recently support was added for the BCM4345 SDIO chipset by
commit 9c51026509d7 ("brcmfmac: Add support for BCM4345 SDIO chipset")
however this was verified using a BCM43455 device, which is
a more recent revision of the chip. This patch assure that
older revisions are not probed as they would fail.
