fm10k: only show actual queues, not the maximum in hardware

Currently, we show statistics for all 128 queues, even though we don't
necessarily have that many queues available especially in the VF case.
Instead, use the hw->mac.max_queues value, which tells us how many
queues we actually have, rather than the space for the rings we
allocated. In this way, we prevent dumping statistics that are useless
on the VF.
