ALSA: pcm: Modify double acknowledged interrupts check condition

Currently in snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0 during interrupt,
we consider there were double acknowledged interrupts when:
1. HW reported pointer is smaller than expected, and
2. Time from last update time (hdelta) is over half a buffer time.

However, when HW reported pointer is only a few bytes smaller than
expected, and when hdelta is just a little larger than half a buffer time
(e.g. ping-pong buffer), it wrongly treats this IRQ as double acknowledged.

The condition #2 uses jiffies, but jiffies is not high resolution
since it is integer. We should consider jiffies inaccuracy.
