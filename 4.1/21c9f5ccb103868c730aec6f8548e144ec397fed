p9_client_attach(): set fid->uid correctly

it's almost always equal to current_fsuid(), but there's an exception -
if the first writeback fid is opened by non-root *and* that happens before
root has done any lookups in /, we end up doing attach for root.  The
current code leaves the resulting FID owned by root from the server POV
and by non-root from the client one.  Unfortunately, it means that e.g.
massive dcache eviction will leave that user buggered - they'll end
up redoing walks from / *and* picking that FID every time.  As soon as
they try to create something, the things will get nasty.
