perf list: Allow listing events with 'tracepoint' prefix

If somebody happens to name an event with the beginning of 'tracepoint'
(e.g. tracepoint_foo), then it will never be showed with perf list
event_glob, thus we parse the argument 'tracepoint' more carefully for
accuracy.

Example:

Before this patch:

 $ perf list tracepoint_foo:*

   jbd2:jbd2_start_commit                             [Tracepoint event]
   jbd2:jbd2_commit_locking                           [Tracepoint event]
   jbd2:jbd2_run_stats                                [Tracepoint event]
   block:block_rq_issue                               [Tracepoint event]
   block:block_bio_complete                           [Tracepoint event]
   block:block_bio_backmerge                          [Tracepoint event]
   block:block_getrq                                  [Tracepoint event]
   ...                                                ...

As shown above, all of the tracepoint events are printed. In fact, the
command's real intention is to print the events of tracepoint_foo.

After this patch:

 $ perf list tracepoint_foo:*

   tracepoint_foo:tp_foo_enter                        [Tracepoint event]
   tracepoint_foo:tp_foo_exit                         [Tracepoint event]

As shown above, only the events of tracepoint_foo are printed.
