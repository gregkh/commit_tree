nilfs2: put out gfp mask manipulation from nilfs_set_inode_flags()

nilfs_set_inode_flags() function adjusts gfp-mask of inode->i_mapping as
well as i_flags, however, this coupling of operations is not appropriate.

For instance, nilfs_ioctl_setflags(), one of three callers of
nilfs_set_inode_flags(), doesn't need to reinitialize the gfp-mask at all.
 In addition, nilfs_new_inode(), another caller of
nilfs_set_inode_flags(), doesn't either because it has already initialized
the gfp-mask.

Only __nilfs_read_inode(), the remaining caller, needs it.  So, this moves
the gfp mask manipulation to __nilfs_read_inode() from
nilfs_set_inode_flags().
