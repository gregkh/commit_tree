Input: alps - fix finger jumps on lifting 2 fingers on v7 touchpad

On v7 touchpads sometimes when 2 fingers are moved down on the touchpad
until they "fall of" the touchpad, the second touch will report 0 for y
(max y really since the y axis is inverted) and max x as coordinates,
rather then reporting 0, 0 as is expected for a non touching finger.

This commit detects this and treats these touches as non touching.
