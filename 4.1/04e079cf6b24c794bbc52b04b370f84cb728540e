mmc: sdhci: fix card presence logic in sdhci_request function

The sdhci_request function should consider a non-removable device
always present.
Call the correct logic already available in sdhci_do_get_cd function.

This fixes some logic paths where MMC requests are being made to
non-removable devices that do not have the card detect pin connected
on the hardware as it is non-removable.
