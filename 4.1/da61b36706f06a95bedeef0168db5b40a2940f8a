fm10k: mbx_update_max_size does not drop all oversized messages

When we call update_max_size it does not drop all oversized messages.
This is due to the difficulty in performing this operation, since it is
a FIFO which makes updating anything other than head or tail very
difficult. To fix this, modify validate_msg_size to ensure that we error
out later when trying to transmit the message that could be oversized.
This will generally be a rare condition, as it requires the FIFO to
include a message larger than the max_size negotiated during mailbox
connect. Note that max_size is always smaller than rx.size so it should
be safe to use here.

Also, update the update_max_size function header comment to clearly
indicate that it does not drop all oversized messages, but only those at
the head of the FIFO.
