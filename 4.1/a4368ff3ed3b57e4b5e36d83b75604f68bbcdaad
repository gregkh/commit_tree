Bluetooth: Refactor L2CAP variables into l2cap_ctrl

We're getting very close to the maximum possible size of bt_skb_cb. To
prepare to shrink the struct with the help of a union this patch moves
all L2CAP related variables into the l2cap_ctrl struct. To later add
other 'ctrl' structs the L2CAP one is renamed simple 'l2cap' instead
of 'control'.
