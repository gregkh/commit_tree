perf list: Sort the output of 'perf list' to view more clearly

Sort the output according to ASCII character list (using strcmp), which
supports both number sequence and alphabet sequence.

Example:

Before this patch:

 $ perf list

 List of pre-defined events (to be used in -e):
   cpu-cycles OR cycles                               [Hardware event]
   instructions                                       [Hardware event]
   cache-references                                   [Hardware event]
   cache-misses                                       [Hardware event]
   branch-instructions OR branches                    [Hardware event]
   branch-misses                                      [Hardware event]
   bus-cycles                                         [Hardware event]
   ...                                                ...

   jbd2:jbd2_start_commit                             [Tracepoint event]
   jbd2:jbd2_commit_locking                           [Tracepoint event]
   jbd2:jbd2_run_stats                                [Tracepoint event]
   block:block_rq_issue                               [Tracepoint event]
   block:block_bio_complete                           [Tracepoint event]
   block:block_bio_backmerge                          [Tracepoint event]
   block:block_getrq                                  [Tracepoint event]
   ...                                                ...
