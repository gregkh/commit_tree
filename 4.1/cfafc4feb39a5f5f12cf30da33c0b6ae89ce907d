MIPS: math-emu: Move long fixed-point support into an `ar' library

Complement 593d33fe [MIPS: math-emu: Move various objects into an ar
library.] and also move sp_tlong.o, sp_flong.o, dp_tlong.o, and
dp_flong.o into an `ar' library.  These objects implement long
fixed-point format support that can be omitted from MIPS I, MIPS II and
MIPS32r1 configurations.
