drm/tegra: Don't use vblank_disable_immediate on incapable driver.

Tegra would not only need a hardware vblank counter that
increments at leading edge of vblank, but also support
for instantaneous high precision vblank timestamp queries, ie.
a proper implementation of dev->driver->get_vblank_timestamp().

Without these, there can be off-by-one errors during vblank
disable/enable if the scanout is inside vblank at en/disable
time, and additionally clients will never see any useable
vblank timestamps when querying via drmWaitVblank ioctl. This
would negatively affect swap scheduling under X11 and Wayland.
