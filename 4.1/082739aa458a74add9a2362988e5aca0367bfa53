tools: bpf_jit_disasm: fix segfault on disabled debugging log output

With recent debugging, I noticed that bpf_jit_disasm segfaults when
there's no debugging output from the JIT compiler to the kernel log.

Reason is that when regexec(3) doesn't match on anything, start/end
offsets are not being filled out and contain some uninitialized garbage
from stack. Thus, we need zero out offsets first.
