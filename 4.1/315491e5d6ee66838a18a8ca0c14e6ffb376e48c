remoteproc: add IOMMU hardware capability flag

The remoteproc framework currently relies on iommu_present() on
the bus the device is on, to perform MMU management. However, this
logic doesn't scale for multi-arch, especially for processors that
do not have an IOMMU. Replace this logic instead by using a h/w
capability flag for the presence of IOMMU in the rproc structure.

This issue is seen on OMAP platforms when trying to add a remoteproc
driver for a small Cortex M3 called the WkupM3 used for suspend /
resume management on TI AM335/AM437x SoCs. This processor does not
have an MMU. Same is the case with another processor subsystem
PRU-ICSS on AM335/AM437x. All these are platform devices, and the
current iommu_present check will not scale for the same kernel image
to support OMAP4/OMAP5 and AM335/AM437x.

The existing platform implementation drivers - OMAP remoteproc, STE
Modem remoteproc and DA8xx remoteproc, are updated as well to properly
configure the newly added rproc field.
