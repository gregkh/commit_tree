netlink: Remove max_size setting

We currently limit the hash table size to 64K which is very bad
as even 10 years ago it was relatively easy to generate millions
of sockets.

Since the hash table is naturally limited by memory allocation
failure, we don't really need an explicit limit so this patch
removes it.
