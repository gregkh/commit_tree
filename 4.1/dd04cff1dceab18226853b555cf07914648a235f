arm64: standardize mmap_rnd() usage

In preparation for splitting out ET_DYN ASLR, this refactors the use of
mmap_rnd() to be used similarly to arm and x86.  This additionally
enables mmap ASLR on legacy mmap layouts, which appeared to be missing
on arm64, and was already supported on arm.  Additionally removes a
copy/pasted declaration of an unused function.
