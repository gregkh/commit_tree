sched: Optimize freq invariant accounting

Currently the freq invariant accounting (in
__update_entity_runnable_avg() and sched_rt_avg_update()) get the
scale factor from a weak function call, this means that even for archs
that default on their implementation the compiler cannot see into this
function and optimize the extra scaling math away.

This is sad, esp. since its a 64-bit multiplication which can be quite
costly on some platforms.

So replace the weak function with #ifdef and __always_inline goo. This
is not quite as nice from an arch support PoV but should at least
result in compile time errors if done wrong.
