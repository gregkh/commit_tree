mmc: dw_mmc: Don't crash if we get an interrupt before slot has initted

It's unlikely that this is really needed on any single-slot systems
where we disable card detects until the end of probe, but it still
seems safer to check to make sure that a slot has been initted before
we try to dereference it to find the SDIO interrupt mask.
