drm/i915/skl: Extract tile height code into a helper function

It will be used in a later patch and also convert all height parameters
from int to unsigned int.

v2: Rebased for fb modifiers.
v3: Fixed v2 rebase.
v4:
   * Height should be unsigned int.
   * Make it take pixel_format for consistency and simplicity.
