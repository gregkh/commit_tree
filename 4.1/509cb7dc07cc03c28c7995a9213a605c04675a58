serial: 8250: Validate reg addr for Au1x00/RT288x i/o accessors

Au1x00/RT2800+ hardware has an alternate register layout which is
remapped with lookup tables by the au_serial_in()/out() i/o accessors.
However, the h/w does not support the complete 8250 register set, and
accesses to unmapped registers cause out-of-bounds lookups. Further,
because the lookup tables are defined by designated initializers, the
tables may contain unmapped entries (although the current tables do not).

Declare fixed-size lookup tables with contiguous initialization for
the complete 8250 register map; unmapped registers are initialized to -1.
Validate the register index (ie., 'offset') is in the range [0, table size).
Return fixed value for unmapped register reads and ignore unmapped register
writes.
