driver core: Implement device property accessors through fwnode ones

Now that the ACPI companions of devices are pointed to by the fwnode
field in struct device, the device_property_*() accessor functions
can be modified to use their fwnode_property_*() counterparts
internally with minimum extra overhead in the IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_OF)
case, so make those changes.

This allows us to get rid of the rather ugly DEV_PROP_READ_ARRAY()
macro among other things.
