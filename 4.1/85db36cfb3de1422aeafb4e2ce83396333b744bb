Btrfs: fix inode cache writeout

The code to fix stalls during free spache cache IO wasn't using
the correct root when waiting on the IO for inode caches.  This
is only a problem when the inode cache is enabled with

mount -o inode_cache

This fixes the inode cache writeout to preserve any error values and
makes sure not to override the root when inode cache writeout is done.
