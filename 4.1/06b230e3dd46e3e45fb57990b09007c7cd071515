cpupower: fix breakage from libpci API change

libpci 3.3.0 introduced an additional member in the pci_filter struct
which needs to be initialized to -1 to get the same behavior as before
the API change. The libpci internal helpers got updated accordingly,
but as the cpupower pci helpers initialized the struct themselves the
behavior changed.

Use the libpci helper pci_filter_init() to fix this and guard against
similar breakages in the future.

This fixes probing of the AMD fam12h/14h cpuidle monitor on systems
with libpci >= 3.3.0.
