direct_IO: use iov_iter_rw() instead of rw everywhere

The rw parameter to direct_IO is redundant with iov_iter->type, and
treated slightly differently just about everywhere it's used: some users
do rw & WRITE, and others do rw == WRITE where they should be doing a
bitwise check. Simplify this with the new iov_iter_rw() helper, which
always returns either READ or WRITE.
