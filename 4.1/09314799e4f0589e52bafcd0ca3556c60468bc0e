md: remove 'go_faster' option from ->sync_request()

This option is not well justified and testing suggests that
it hardly ever makes any difference.

The comment suggests there might be a need to wait for non-resync
activity indicated by ->nr_waiting, however raise_barrier()
already waits for all of that.

So just remove it to simplify reasoning about speed limiting.

This allows us to remove a 'FIXME' comment from raid5.c as that
never used the flag.
