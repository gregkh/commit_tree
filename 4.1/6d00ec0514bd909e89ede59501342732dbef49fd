cfg80211: don't allow disabling WEXT if it's required

The change to only export WEXT symbols when required could break
the build if CONFIG_CFG80211_WEXT was explicitly disabled while
a driver like orinoco selected it.

Fix this by hiding the symbol when it's required so it can't be
disabled in that case.
