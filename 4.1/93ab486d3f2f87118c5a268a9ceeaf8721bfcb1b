Staging: rtl8188eu: Changed array and loop construct

This function only required the array from the 14th element
onwards. Therefore, the array size is reduced and the loop
counter is modified so as to start from 0.
Also, the assignment of variable place is redundant as it is
initialized again in the loop.
