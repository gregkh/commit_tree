net: dsa: make NET_DSA manually selectable from the config

Change bd76a116707bd2381da36cf7c3183df11293f1d6 made all DSA drivers
depend on NET_DSA rather than selecting them. However, as the only way
to select this option was to actually select a driver, it made DSA
impossible to enable at all.

This patch adds an explicit entry which the user will have to enable
prior selecting a driver.
