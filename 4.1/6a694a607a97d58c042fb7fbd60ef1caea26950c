perf: Update userspace page info for software event

For hardware events, the userspace page of the event gets updated in
context switches, so if we read the timestamp in the page, we get
fresh info.

For software events, this is missing currently. This patch makes the
behavior consistent.

With this patch, we can implement clock_gettime(THREAD_CPUTIME) with
PERF_COUNT_SW_DUMMY in userspace as suggested by Andy and Peter. Code
like this:

  if (pc->cap_user_time) {
	do {
		seq = pc->lock;
		barrier();

		running = pc->time_running;
		cyc = rdtsc();
		time_mult = pc->time_mult;
		time_shift = pc->time_shift;
		time_offset = pc->time_offset;

		barrier();
	} while (pc->lock != seq);

	quot = (cyc >> time_shift);
	rem = cyc & ((1 << time_shift) - 1);
	delta = time_offset + quot * time_mult +
		((rem * time_mult) >> time_shift);

	running += delta;
	return running;
  }

I tried it on a busy system, the userspace page updating doesn't
have noticeable overhead.
