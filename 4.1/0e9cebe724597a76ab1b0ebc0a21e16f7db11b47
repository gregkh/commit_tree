dm: add log writes target

Introduce a new target that is meant for file system developers to test file
system integrity at particular points in the life of a file system.  We capture
all write requests and associated data and log them to a separate device
for later replay.  There is a userspace utility to do this replay.  The
idea behind this is to give file system developers a tool to verify that
the file system is always consistent.
