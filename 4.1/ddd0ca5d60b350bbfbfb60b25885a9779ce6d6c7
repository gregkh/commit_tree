net: bcmgenet: add support for xmit_more

Delay the update of the TDMA producer index unless this is the last SKB
in a batch, or the queue is already stopped. Move the check for whether
the queue should be stopped before the xmit_more check to avoid locking
the transmit queue in case there was a SKB submitted which has xmit_more
set.
