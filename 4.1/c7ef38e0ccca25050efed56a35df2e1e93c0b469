mac80211: Get IV len from key conf and not cipher scheme

When a key is installed using a cipher scheme, set a new
internal key flag (KEY_FLAG_CIPHER_SCHEME) on it, to allow
distinguishing such keys more easily.

In particular, use this flag on the TX path instead of
testing the sta->cipher_scheme pointer, as the station is
NULL for broad-/multicast message, and use the key's iv_len
instead of the cipher scheme information.
