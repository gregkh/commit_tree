IB/core: disallow registering 0-sized memory region

If ib_umem_get() is called with a size equal to 0 and an
non-page aligned address, one page will be pinned and a
0-sized umem will be returned to the caller.

This should not be allowed: it's not expected for a memory
region to have a size equal to 0.

This patch adds a check to explicitly refuse to register
a 0-sized region.
