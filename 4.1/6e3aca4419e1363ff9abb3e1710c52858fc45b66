irqchip: gic: Don't complain in gic_get_cpumask() if UP system

In a uniprocessor implementation the interrupt processor targets
registers are read-as-zero/write-ignored (RAZ/WI). Unfortunately
gic_get_cpumask() will print a critical message saying

 GIC CPU mask not found - kernel will fail to boot.

if these registers all read as zero, but there won't actually be
a problem on uniprocessor systems and the kernel will boot just
fine. Skip this check if we're running a UP kernel or if we
detect that the hardware only supports a single processor.
