xen: support suspend/resume in pvscsi frontend

Up to now the pvscsi frontend hasn't supported domain suspend and
resume. When a domain with an assigned pvscsi device was suspended
and resumed again, it was not able to use the device any more: trying
to do so resulted in hanging processes.

Support suspend and resume of pvscsi devices.
