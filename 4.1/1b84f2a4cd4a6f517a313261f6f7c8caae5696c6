mfd: cros_ec: Use fixed size arrays to transfer data with the EC

The struct cros_ec_command will be used as an ioctl() argument for the
API to control the ChromeOS EC from user-space. So the data structure
has to be 64-bit safe to make it compatible between 32 and 64 avoiding
the need for a compat ioctl interface. Since pointers are self-aligned
to different byte boundaries, use fixed size arrays instead of pointers
for transferring ingoing and outgoing data with the Embedded Controller.

Also, re-arrange struct members by decreasing alignment requirements to
reduce the needing padding size.
