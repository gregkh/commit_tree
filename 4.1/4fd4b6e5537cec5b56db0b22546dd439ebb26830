x86/alternatives: Use optimized NOPs for padding

Alternatives allow now for an empty old instruction. In this case we go
and pad the space with NOPs at assembly time. However, there are the
optimal, longer NOPs which should be used. Do that at patching time by
adding alt_instr.padlen-sized NOPs at the old instruction address.
