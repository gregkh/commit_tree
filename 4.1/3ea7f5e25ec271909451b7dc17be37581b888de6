fork_init: update max_threads comment

The comment explaining what value max_threads is set to is outdated.  The
maximum memory consumption ratio for thread structures was 1/2 until
February 2002, then it was briefly changed to 1/16 before being set to 1/8
which we still use today.  The comment was never updated to reflect that
change, it's about time.
