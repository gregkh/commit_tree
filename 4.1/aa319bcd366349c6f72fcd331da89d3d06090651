perf: Disallow sparse AUX allocations for non-SG PMUs in overwrite mode

PMUs that don't support hardware scatter tables require big contiguous
chunks of memory and a PMI to switch between them. However, in overwrite
using a PMI for this purpose adds extra overhead that the users would
like to avoid. Thus, in overwrite mode for such PMUs we can only allow
one contiguous chunk for the entire requested buffer.

This patch changes the behavior accordingly, so that if the buddy allocator
fails to come up with a single high-order chunk for the entire requested
buffer, the allocation will fail.
