usb: gadget: composite: add req_match method to usb_function

Non-standard requests can encode the actual interface number in a
non-standard way. For example composite_setup() assumes
that it is w_index && 0xFF, but the printer function encodes the interface
number in a context-dependet way (either w_index or w_index >> 8).
This can lead to such requests being directed to wrong functions.

This patch adds req_match() method to usb_function. Its purpose is to
verify that a given request can be handled by a given function.
If any function within a configuration provides the method and it returns
true, then it is assumed that the right function is found.

If a function uses req_match(), it should try as hard as possible to
determine if the request is meant for it.

If no functions in a configuration provide req_match or none of them
returns true, then fall back to the usual approach.
