rcu: Detect stalls caused by failure to propagate up rcu_node tree

If all CPUs have passed through quiescent states, then stalls might be
due to starvation of the grace-period kthread or to failure to propagate
the quiescent states up the rcu_node combining tree.  The current stall
warning messages do not differentiate, so this commit adds a printout
of the root rcu_node structure's ->qsmask field.
