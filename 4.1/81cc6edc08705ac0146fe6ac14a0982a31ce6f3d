dmaengine: pl330: Fix hang on dmaengine_terminate_all on certain boards

The pl330 device could hang infinitely on certain boards when DMA
channels are terminated.

It was caused by lack of runtime resume when executing
pl330_terminate_all() which calls the _stop() function. _stop() accesses
device register and can loop infinitely while checking for device state.

The hang was confirmed by Dinh Nguyen on Altera SOCFPGA Cyclone V
board during boot. It can be also triggered with:

$ echo 1 > /sys/module/dmatest/parameters/iterations
$ echo dma1chan0 > /sys/module/dmatest/parameters/channel
$ echo 1 > /sys/module/dmatest/parameters/run
$ sleep 1
$ cat /sys/module/dmatest/parameters/run
