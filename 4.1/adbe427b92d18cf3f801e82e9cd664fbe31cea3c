memcg: zap mem_cgroup_lookup()

mem_cgroup_lookup() is a wrapper around mem_cgroup_from_id(), which
checks that id != 0 before issuing the function call.  Today, there is
no point in this additional check apart from optimization, because there
is no css with id <= 0, so that css_from_id, called by
mem_cgroup_from_id, will return NULL for any id <= 0.

Since mem_cgroup_from_id is only called from mem_cgroup_lookup, let us
zap mem_cgroup_lookup, substituting calls to it with mem_cgroup_from_id
and moving the check if id > 0 to css_from_id.
