powerpc: Export __spin_yield

Export __spin_yield so that the arch_spin_unlock() function can
be invoked from a module. This will be required for modules where
we want to take a lock that is also is acquired in hypervisor
real mode. Because we want to avoid running any lockdep code
(which may not be safe in real mode), this lock needs to be
an arch_spinlock_t instead of a normal spinlock.
