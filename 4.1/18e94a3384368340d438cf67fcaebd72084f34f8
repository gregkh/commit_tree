PCI: Make a shareable UUID for PCI firmware ACPI _DSM

The PCI Firmware Specification, r3.0, sec 4.6.4.1.3, defines a single UUID
for an ACPI _DSM method to provide device-specific control functions.  This
_DSM method support several functions, including PCI Express Slot
Information, PCI Express Slot Number, PCI Bus Capabilities, etc.

Move the UUID definition from pci/pci-label.c, where it could be used only
for one function, to pci/pci-acpi.c where it can be shared for all these
functions.
