cleancache: forbid overriding cleancache_ops

Currently, cleancache_register_ops returns the previous value of
cleancache_ops to allow chaining.  However, chaining, as it is
implemented now, is extremely dangerous due to possible pool id
collisions.  Suppose, a new cleancache driver is registered after the
previous one assigned an id to a super block.  If the new driver assigns
the same id to another super block, which is perfectly possible, we will
have two different filesystems using the same id.  No matter if the new
driver implements chaining or not, we are likely to get data corruption
with such a configuration eventually.

This patch therefore disables the ability to override cleancache_ops
altogether as potentially dangerous.  If there is already cleancache
driver registered, all further calls to cleancache_register_ops will
return EBUSY.  Since no user of cleancache implements chaining, we only
need to make minor changes to the code outside the cleancache core.
