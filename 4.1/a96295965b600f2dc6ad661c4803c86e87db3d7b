Btrfs: fix racy system chunk allocation when setting block group ro

If while setting a block group read-only we end up allocating a system
chunk, through check_system_chunk(), we were not doing it while holding
the chunk mutex which is a problem if a concurrent chunk allocation is
happening, through do_chunk_alloc(), as it means both block groups can
end up using the same logical addresses and physical regions in the
device(s). So make sure we hold the chunk mutex.
