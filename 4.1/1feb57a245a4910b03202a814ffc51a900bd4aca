gpio: add parameter to allow the use named gpios

The gpio binding document says that new code should always use named
gpios. Patch 40b73183 added support to parse a list of gpios from child
nodes, but does not make it possible to use named gpios. This patch adds
the con_id property and implements it is done in gpiolib.c, where the
old-style of using unnamed gpios still works.
