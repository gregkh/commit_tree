staging/lustre/ptlrpc: fix import state during replay

Client doesn't restore import state correctly
on reconnect during replay. It resends lock replay
when final ping was queued by server.
Server fails with "target_queue_recovery_request())
ASSERTION( req->rq_export->exp_lock_replay_needed ) failed"

Add imp_replay_state to store last replay state.
imp_state is restored from imp_replay_state
during reconnect.
