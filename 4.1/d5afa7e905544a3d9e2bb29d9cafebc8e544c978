MIPS: math-emu: Reinstate sNaN quieting handlers

Revert the changes made by commit fdffbafb [Lots of FPU bug fixes from
Kjeld Borch Egevang.] to `ieee754sp_nanxcpt' and `ieee754dp_nanxcpt'
sNaN quieting handlers and their callers so that sNaN processing is done
within the handlers againg.  Pass the sNaN causing an IEEE 754 invalid
operation exception down to the relevant handler.  Pass the sNaN in `fs'
where two sNaNs are supplied to a binary operation.

Set the Invalid Operation FCSR exception bits in the quieting handlers
rather than at their call sites throughout.  Make the handlers exclusive
for sNaN processing.
