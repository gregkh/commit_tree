ARM: pmu: add support for interrupt-affinity property

Historically, the PMU devicetree bindings have expected SPIs to be
listed in order of *logical* CPU number. This is problematic for
bootloaders, especially when the boot CPU (logical ID 0) isn't listed
first in the devicetree.

This patch adds a new optional property, interrupt-affinity, to the
PMU node which allows the interrupt affinity to be described using
a list of phandled to CPU nodes, with each entry in the list
corresponding to the SPI at the same index in the interrupts property.
