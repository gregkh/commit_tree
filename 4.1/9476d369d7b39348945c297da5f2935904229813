ALSA: hda - Mute headphone pin on suspend on XPS13 9333

Muting the headphone output pin right before the codec suspension
prevents pop noises when headphones are plugged in (except for a
barely audible click noise).
This solution allows to truly save some power when headphones are
plugged in unlike the previous solution (033b0a7ca9c:
