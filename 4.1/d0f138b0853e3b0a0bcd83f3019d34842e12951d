sparc: switch to using asm-generic for seccomp.h

Switch to using the newly created asm-generic/seccomp.h for the seccomp
strict mode syscall definitions. The obsolete sigreturn in COMPAT mode
is retained as an override. Remaining definitions are identical. Also
corrected missing #define for header reinclusion protection.
