rhashtable: Make rhashtable_init params argument const

This patch marks the rhashtable_init params argument const as
there is no reason to modify it since we will always make a copy
of it in the rhashtable.

This patch also fixes a bug where we don't actually round up the
value of min_size unless it is less than HASH_MIN_SIZE.
