dm crypt: leverage immutable biovecs when decrypting on read

Commit 003b5c571 ("block: Convert drivers to immutable biovecs")
stopped short of changing dm-crypt to leverage the fact that the biovec
array of a bio will no longer be modified.

Switch to using bio_clone_fast() when cloning bios for decryption after
read.
