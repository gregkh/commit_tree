MIPS: disable FPU if the mode is unsupported

The expected semantics of __enable_fpu are for the FPU to be enabled
in the given mode if possible, otherwise for the FPU to be left
disabled and SIGFPE returned. The FPU was incorrectly being left
enabled in cases where the desired value for FR was unavailable.
Without ensuring the FPU is disabled in this case, it would be
possible for userland to go on to execute further FP instructions
natively in the incorrect mode, rather than those instructions being
trapped & emulated as they need to be.
