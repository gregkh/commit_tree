ip_vti/ip6_vti: Preserve skb->mark after rcv_cb call

The vti6_rcv_cb and vti_rcv_cb calls were leaving the skb->mark modified
after completing the function.  This resulted in the original skb->mark
value being lost.  Since we only need skb->mark to be set for
xfrm_policy_check we can pull the assignment into the rcv_cb calls and then
just restore the original mark after xfrm_policy_check has been completed.
