MIPS: Respect the FCSR exception mask for `si_code'

Respect the FCSR exception mask when interpreting the IEEE 754 exception
condition to report with SIGFPE in `si_code', so as not to use one that
has been masked where a different one set in parallel caused the FPE
hardware exception to trigger.  As per the IEEE Std 754 the Inexact
exception can happen together with Overflow or Underflow.
