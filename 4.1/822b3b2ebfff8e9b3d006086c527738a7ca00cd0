net: Add max rate tx queue attribute

This adds a tx_maxrate attribute to the tx queue sysfs entry allowing
for max-rate limiting. Along with DCB-ETS and BQL this provides another
knob to tune queue performance. The limit units are Mbps.

By default it is disabled. To disable the rate limitation after it
has been set for a queue, it should be set to zero.
