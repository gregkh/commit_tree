vfio/platform: read and write support for the device fd

VFIO returns a file descriptor which we can use to manipulate the memory
regions of the device. Usually, the user will mmap memory regions that are
addressable on page boundaries, however for memory regions where this is
not the case we cannot provide mmap functionality due to security concerns.
For this reason we also allow to use read and write functions to the file
descriptor pointing to the memory regions.

We implement this functionality only for MMIO regions of platform devices;
PIO regions are not being handled at this point.
