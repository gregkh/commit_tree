fib_trie: Correctly handle case of key == 0 in leaf_walk_rcu

In the case of a trie that had no tnodes with a key of 0 the initial
look-up would fail resulting in an out-of-bounds cindex on the first tnode.
This resulted in an entire trie being skipped.

In order resolve this I have updated the cindex logic in the initial
look-up so that if the key is zero we will always traverse the child zero
path.

Fixes: 8be33e95 ("fib_trie: Fib walk rcu should take a tnode and key instead of a trie and a leaf")
