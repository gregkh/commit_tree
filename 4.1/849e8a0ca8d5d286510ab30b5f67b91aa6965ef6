tcp_metrics: Add a field tcpm_net and verify it matches on lookup

In preparation for using one tcp metrics hash table for all network
namespaces add a field tcpm_net to struct tcp_metrics_block, and
verify that field on all hash table lookups.

Make the field tcpm_net of type possible_net_t so it takes no space
when network namespaces are disabled.

Further add a function tm_net to read that field so we can be
efficient when network namespaces are disabled and concise
the rest of the time.
