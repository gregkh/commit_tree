x86/asm/entry: Remove INIT_TSS and fold the definitions into 'cpu_tss'

The INIT_TSS is unnecessary.  Just define the initial TSS where
'cpu_tss' is defined.

While we're at it, merge the 32-bit and 64-bit definitions.  The
only syntactic change is that 32-bit kernels were computing sp0
as long, but now they compute it as unsigned long.

Verified by objdump: the contents and relocations of
.data..percpu..shared_aligned are unchanged on 32-bit and 64-bit
kernels.
