bridge: fix multicast router rlist endless loop

Since the addition of sysfs multicast router support if one set
multicast_router to "2" more than once, then the port would be added to
the hlist every time and could end up linking to itself and thus causing an
endless loop for rlist walkers.
So to reproduce just do:
echo 2 > multicast_router; echo 2 > multicast_router;
in a bridge port and let some igmp traffic flow, for me it hangs up
in br_multicast_flood().
Fix this by adding a check in br_multicast_add_router() if the port is
already linked.
The reason this didn't happen before the addition of multicast_router
sysfs entries is because there's a !hlist_unhashed check that prevents
it.
