HID: wacom: ask for a in-prox report when it was missed

If noone listens to the input device when a tool comes in proximity,
the tablet does not send the in-prox event when a client becomes available.
That means that no events will be sent until the tool is taken out of
proximity.

In this situation, ask for the report WACOM_REPORT_INTUOSREAD which will
read the corresponding feature and generate an in-prox event.
To make some generation of hardware working, we need to unset the
quirk NO_GET set by hid-core because the interfaces are seen as "boot
mouse".

We don't schedule this read in a worker while we are in an IO interrupt.
We know that usbhid will do it asynchronously. If this is triggered by
uhid, then this is obviously a client side bug :)
