drm/i915: Assume dual channel LVDS if pixel clock necessitates it

Single channel LVDS maxes out at 112 MHz, anything above must be dual
channel. This avoids the need to specify i915.lvds_channel_mode=2 on
all 17" MacBook Pro models with i915 graphics since they had 1920x1200
(193 MHz), plus those 15" pre-retina models which had a resolution
of 1680x1050 (119 MHz) as a BTO option.

Source for 112 MHz limit of single channel LVDS is section 2.3 of:
https://01.org/linuxgraphics/sites/default/files/documentation/ivb_ihd_os_vol3_part4.pdf

v2: Avoid hardcoding 17" models by assuming dual channel LVDS if the
resolution necessitates it, suggested by Jani Nikula.

v3: Fix typo, thanks Joonas Lahtinen.

v4: Split commit in two, suggested by Ville Syrj채l채.
