netlink: move nl_table in read_mostly section

netlink sockets creation and deletion heavily modify nl_table_users
and nl_table_lock.

If nl_table is sharing one cache line with one of them, netlink
performance is really bad on SMP.

ffffffff81ff5f0c b nl_table_users

Putting nl_table in read_mostly section increased performance
of my open/delete netlink sockets test by about 80 %

This came up while diagnosing a getaddrinfo() problem.
