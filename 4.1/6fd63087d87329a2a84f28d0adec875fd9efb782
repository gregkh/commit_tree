spi: fsl-dspi: Fix clock rate scale values

Previous algorithm had an outer loop with the values {2,3,5,7} and an
inner loop with {2,4,6,8,16,32,...,32768}, and would pick the first
value over the required scaling value (where the total scale was the two
numbers multiplied).

Since the inner loop went up to 32768 it would always pick a value of 2
for PBR and a much higher than necessary value for BR.  The desired
scale factor was being divided by two I believe to compensate for the
much higher scale factors (the divide by two not specified in the
reference manual).

Updated to check all values and find the smallest scale factor possible
without going over the desired clock rate.
