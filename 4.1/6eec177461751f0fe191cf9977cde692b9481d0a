RDMA/core: Enable the iWarp Port Mapper to provide the actual address of the connecting peer to its clients

Add functionality to enable the port mapper on the passive side to provide to its
clients the actual (non-mapped) ip/tcp address information of the connecting peer

1) Adding remote_info_cb() to process the address info of the connecting peer
   The address info is provided by the user space port mapper service when
   the connection is initiated by the peer
2) Adding a hash list to store the remote address info
3) Adding functionality to add/remove the remote address info
   After the info has been provided to the port mapper client,
   it is removed from the hash list
