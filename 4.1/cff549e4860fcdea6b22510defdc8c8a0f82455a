scsi: proper state checking and module refcount handling in scsi_device_get

This effectively reverts commits 85b6c7 ("[SCSI] sd: fix cache flushing on
module removal (and individual device removal)" and dc4515ea ("scsi: always
increment reference count").

We now never call scsi_device_get from the shutdown path, and the fact
that we started grabbing reference there in commit 85b6c7 turned out
turned out to create more problems than it solves, and required
workarounds for workarounds for workarounds. Move back to properly checking
the device state and carefully handle module refcounting.
