powerpc: Replace mem_init_done with slab_is_available()

We have a powerpc specific global called mem_init_done which is "set on
boot once kmalloc can be called".

But that's not *quite* true. We set it at the bottom of mem_init(), and
rely on the fact that mm_init() calls kmem_cache_init() immediately
after that, and nothing is running in parallel.

So replace it with the generic and 100% correct slab_is_available().
