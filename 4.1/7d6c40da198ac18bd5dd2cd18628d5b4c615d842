KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Use bitmap of active threads rather than count

Currently, the entry_exit_count field in the kvmppc_vcore struct
contains two 8-bit counts, one of the threads that have started entering
the guest, and one of the threads that have started exiting the guest.
This changes it to an entry_exit_map field which contains two bitmaps
of 8 bits each.  The advantage of doing this is that it gives us a
bitmap of which threads need to be signalled when exiting the guest.
That means that we no longer need to use the trick of setting the
HDEC to 0 to pull the other threads out of the guest, which led in
some cases to a spurious HDEC interrupt on the next guest entry.
