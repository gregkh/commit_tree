Revert "MIPS: Don't assume 64-bit FP registers for context switch"

This reverts commit 02987633df7ba2f62967791dda816eb191d1add3.

The basic premise of the patch was incorrect since MSA context
(including FP state) is saved using st.d which stores two consecutive
64-bit words in memory rather than a single 128-bit word. This means
that even with big endian MSA, the FP state is still in the first 64-bit
word.
