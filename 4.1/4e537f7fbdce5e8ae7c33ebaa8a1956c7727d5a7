bpf: Make internal bpf API independent of CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL #ifdefs

Socket filter code and other subsystems with upcoming eBPF
support should not need to deal with the fact that we have
CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL defined or not.

Having the bpf syscall as a config option is a nice thing and
I'd expect it to stay that way for expert users (I presume one
day the default setting of it might change, though), but code
making use of it should not care if it's actually enabled or
not.

Instead, hide this via header files and let the rest deal with it.
