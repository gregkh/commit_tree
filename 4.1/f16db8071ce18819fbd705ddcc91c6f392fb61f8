UBI: initialize LEB number variable

In some of the 'out_not_moved' error paths, lnum may be used
uninitialized. Don't ignore the warning; let's fix it.

This uninitialized variable doesn't have much visible effect in the end,
since we just schedule the PEB for erasure, and its LEB number doesn't
really matter (it just gets printed in debug messages). But let's get it
straight anyway.
