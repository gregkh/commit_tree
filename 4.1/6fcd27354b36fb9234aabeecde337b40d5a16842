net/mlx4_en: Support general selective view of ethtool statistics

The driver uses a bitmask to indicate which statistics should be
displayed to the user in ethtool. The bitmask is u64, therefore we are
limited for a selective view of up to 64 statistics. Extend the bitmap
in order to show more than 64 statistics.

In addition, add packet statistics to the ethtool display for PF.
