MIPS: unaligned: Prevent EVA instructions on kernel unaligned accesses

Commit c1771216ab48 ("MIPS: kernel: unaligned: Handle unaligned
accesses for EVA") allowed unaligned accesses to be emulated for
EVA. However, when emulating regular load/store unaligned accesses,
we need to use the appropriate "address space" instructions for that.
Previously, an unaligned load/store instruction in kernel space would
have used the corresponding EVA instructions to emulate it which led to
segmentation faults because of the address translation that happens
with EVA instructions. This is now fixed by using the EVA instruction
only when emulating EVA unaligned accesses.
