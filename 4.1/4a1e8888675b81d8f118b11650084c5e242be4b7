tty/serial: at91: revise the return type of atmel_init_property

The function of atmel_init_property is to set the work manner of
atmel serial ports according to the property in device trees.
If DMA or PDC is not set or something goes wrong in getting property,
the work manner will switch to general PIO mode, thus there will
not be any failure case in this function. It's actually a procedure.
So changing the return type from int to void.
