perf/x86/intel: Implement LRU monitoring ID allocation for CQM

It's possible to run into issues with re-using unused monitoring IDs
because there may be stale cachelines associated with that ID from a
previous allocation. This can cause the LLC occupancy values to be
inaccurate.

To attempt to mitigate this problem we place the IDs on a least recently
used list, essentially a FIFO. The basic idea is that the longer the
time period between ID re-use the lower the probability that stale
cachelines exist in the cache.
