ovl: don't remove non-empty opaque directory

When removing an opaque directory we can't just call rmdir() to check for
emptiness, because the directory will need to be replaced with a whiteout.
The replacement is done with RENAME_EXCHANGE, which doesn't check
emptiness.

Solution is just to check emptiness by reading the directory.  In the
future we could add a new rename flag to check for emptiness even for
RENAME_EXCHANGE to optimize this case.
