irqchip: armada-370-xp: Enable the PMU interrupts

In order to let the Performance Monitoring Unit interrupts flowing in the MPIC,
we need to unmask these interrupts in the Coherency Fabric Local Interrupt Mask
Register.

Since this register is a CPU-local register, unmasking this interrupt needs to
be done on the boot CPU when the driver initializes, but also on the secondary
CPU when they are brought up.
