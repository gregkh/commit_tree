perf tests: Do not rely on dso__data_read_offset() to open dso

Do not rely on dso__data_read_offset() will always call dso__data_fd()
internally.  With multi-thread support, accessing a fd will be protected
by a lock and it'll cause a huge contention.  It can be avoided since we
can skip reading from file if there's a data in the dso cache.

If one needs to call the dso__data_read_offset(), [s]he also needs to
call dso__data_fd() (or set dso->binary_type at least) first like the
dwarf unwind code does.
